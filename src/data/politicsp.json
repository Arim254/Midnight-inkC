    "body": "\n       Loading... \n   For many young voters, the future doesn't feel quite so bright. Gen Z and millennial Americans are feeling increasingly demoralized about their economic prospects, and some say their concerns have gone unaddressed by elected officials.   In communities of all kinds, voters in their 20s and 30s are confronting a financial reality of rising costs, mounting debt and minimal wage growth. But how is this changing their political views?   It's a question that NPR put to readers. We received more than 1,100 submissions from across the political spectrum from almost every state in the U.S.   \n   Many described a similar reality — one where economic worries loom large over their everyday lives and erode their faith in the ability of those in power. Taken together, their responses paint a portrait of a generation of voters discouraged by what they see in Washington and who increasingly feel as if they have no political home.   It is important to note that the responses are not from a representative sample of all young voters. But what readers shared helps highlight a steep challenge facing Democrats and Republicans alike as they work to win over these voters, who are collectively expected to make up more than half the electorate in 2028. Here is a snapshot of what readers shared.    These responses have been edited for clarity and length.   Young voters are united in disappointment    Many young Americans feel a collective sense of disillusionment in the political system, and respondents told NPR that their financial struggles are exacerbating that pain.   Recent polling seems to underscore the frustrations many shared with NPR. Just a fraction of young voters feel confident in government institutions, with less than 2 in 10 of those 18 to 29 years old saying they trust the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time, according to the latest Harvard Youth Poll, from this spring. Similarly, only 16% of those under 30 believe democracy is working well for them, according to a report from the young voter research organization, CIRCLE.    Loading... \n   Their life goals are on hold — for some indefinitely    Young people shared that one of the biggest drivers feeding into their sense of political frustration is the struggle to get ahead financially or even just stay afloat.   When asked what economic success looks like for them, respondents didn't want lavish mansions or high-priced sports cars. Instead, their ambitions were more modest, often centering on the need for financial stability. Yet even that felt out of reach for many.   Young Americans said goals like owning a home, starting a family or pursuing a dream job feel increasingly like a luxury rather than an achievable milestone. Financial concerns are forcing them to reframe what's possible and sometimes choose one goal over another.   Financial roadblocks standing in the way    Many are navigating a unique economic moment where both median home and rental prices, for example, have risen at a faster pace than wages for roughly two decades. People are also waiting longer to buy homes. The median age of a first-time homebuyer in 2024 stood at 38, 10 years older than in the early 1990s, according to the National Association of Realtors.   \n   Debt is also a barrier. Despite collectively making up the largest share of the labor force and being on track to surpass older generations in educational attainment, Generation Z and millennials have higher rates of student loan debt and more mortgage debt.   Family planning looks different as well. People are deciding to have fewer children or not start a family. Last year, the U.S. fertility rate hit a record low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    Loading... \n   They watched their parents succeed, but struggle themselves   In the face of financial challenges, respondents say they're struggling to reach or build upon the lifestyle achieved by their parents and grandparents, making some feel less hopeful about the future.   Even with hard work and a degree, many readers said they have accomplished less than their parents had by the same age. This has led many to feel disillusioned with, even betrayed by, the very system that promised to set them up for success and stability.    Loading... \n   Despite losing faith in most politicians, populism resonates   Young Americans see very few politicians actively addressing their concerns around affordability, leading some to lose faith in the effectiveness of either major political party.   \"Over time, I've come to see our two-party system as two wings on the same bird,\" explained 27-year-old respondent Sophie Howard, from Davenport, Iowa.   When asked which politicians are speaking to their concerns, liberal-leaning respondents frequently highlighted progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York City. Readers on the conservative side often coalesced around President Trump and Vice President Vance.   Many respondents returned to the same point: that they're most inspired by populist-style leaders who focus on disrupting the status quo. It's a message that young people say goes past political labels, pushing some to opposite poles on the ideological spectrum and leaving others feeling stuck in the middle.    Loading... \n",

He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea.   Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term.   1) U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized…   On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl.   \n   Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases.   China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year.   Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology.   2) But a finalized deal isn't done   \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made,\" Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi, \"There wasn't too much left out there.\"   But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss.   Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida.   \n   Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave \"momentum\" for trade talks between the two countries to continue.   \"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements,\" Wilder said.   3) Diplomacy = flattery   A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to cater to Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president.   \n   That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dancers perform as President Donald Trump boards Air Force One at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Malaysia, as he departs for Japan, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025.\n                \n                    Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare – YMCA, a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor.   4) Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker   Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs.   But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker.   His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs.   In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace.   \"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything,\" Trump said.   Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump.   \n   But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, who never formally ended their war.   5) Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill   Despite the deal-making and peace-making on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government.   Instead, he returned to Washington Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the \"nuclear option,\" which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats.   \"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN',\" Trump said, adding that ending the filibuster would \"take advantage\" of Democrats. Democrats have refused to vote in favor of the agreement to temporarily fund the government unless it includes a measure that would extend the tax credit that lowers the cost of health insurance premiums, which is set to expire at the end of the year.\n",

It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.   Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.   \n   Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.   The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.   His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.   \n   From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.   Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.   \n   \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.   \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\"   While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry.   Money for military, but not food aid   The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President JD Vance speaks to the media alongside Sean O'Brien, President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, from left, Chris Sununu, president & CEO of Airlines for America, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and aviation industry representatives, about the impact of the government shutdown on the aviation industry, outside of the West Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 30, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump.   \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol.   \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\"   Deadlines shift to next week   The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia.   That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.   \n   The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.   \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.   GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill   The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill.   Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children.   House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid.   \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party.   \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\"   During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits.   The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\"   \n   \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"   \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said.   What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year.   Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens.\n",

Taylor Taranto, of Pasco, Wash., spent 22 months in the troubled D.C. jail facility while he waited for trial on allegations that he suggested his van was rigged with explosives.  Authorities never found any such devices, though they did recover firearms and a machete.   \n   U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols noted that Taranto had no criminal history — partly because the Justice Department had previously moved to dismiss several charges related to Taranto's participation in the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.   President Trump granted clemency to Taranto and virtually every Jan. 6 defendant on the first day he returned to the White House this year.   But the storming of the Capitol and the Justice Department response to it continue to reverberate, especially within the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington.   Trump and his cabinet officials are trying to rewrite the history of that day, in part by firing or forcing out law enforcement officials who investigated cases related to the riot.    \n   This week the Justice Department sidelined two veteran prosecutors who had worked on the Taranto case and took the rare step of withdrawing a sentencing memo they had filed.   U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro declined to comment on any personnel decisions but in a statement said \"we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously.\"   \"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target,\" Pirro said in the statement.   \n   Original sentencing memo sealed, replaced   The original sentencing memo in Taranto's case detailed how a \"mob of rioters\" attacked the seat of government as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 election.   It also mentioned that Taranto headed in the direction of Obama's home after Trump reposted an address of a location on social media.   A replacement sentencing memo, filed by a new pair of DOJ lawyers, scrubbed both of those references. The electronic court docket last night listed the original memo as sealed.   Judge Nichols said it was \"not entirely clear\" how that memo had come to be sealed and that he intended to release it unless the DOJ could justify keeping it hidden.   \n   The judge did not press the new attorneys for details about the rare, last-minute personnel switch. But he went out of his way to praise the sidelined prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White.   \"I just want to express my view that they did a commendable and excellent job in this case,\" Judge Nichols said. \"They also held the highest standards of professionalism.\"   At a press conference on a D.C. crime issue, Pirro declined to answer whether she ordered the original sentencing memo in the Taranto case to be revoked.   \"I think the papers speak for themselves and what goes on in this office is not something I'm going to comment on to the press,\" Pirro said.   Valdivia and White listened on from the audience in the sixth floor courtroom, surrounded by some of the lawyers who had supervised hundreds of Capitol riot cases — only to be fired or forced out of the Justice Department this year.   \n   Taranto, a Navy veteran with two children, has since returned home to Washington state. He will be required to serve three years of supervised release, undergo a mental health assessment, and to avoid firearms and controlled substances.   \"There's nothing that he did, in fact, that was violent,\" said defense attorney Carmen Hernandez. \"The firearms were in a locked compartment in a van.\"   Taranto signaled he would appeal in the coming weeks. He used his brief time before the judge to address what he called \"deeply troubling issues concerning our founding, our history\" and \"election fraud for the 2020 election.\"\n",

A slim majority of the GOP-led Senate voted this week to roll back Trump's use of emergency powers to set tariffs on Canada, Brazil and other countries.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In a series of three votes this week, a slim majority of the GOP-led Senate delivered a rare, bipartisan rebuke of President Trump's use of emergency powers to set tariffs on Canada, Brazil and other countries.   The last of these votes — a measure approved Thursday to roll back global tariffs announced by Trump in April — passed by a margin of 51 to 47. Democrats cleared the measure with support from four Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Kentucky's Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul.   \"The way that the president has imposed the tariffs is leading to nothing but chaos,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the lead sponsor of the measure, said ahead of the vote. Kaine said the strategy behind Trump's tariff policy amounted to, \"Announce tariffs on everyone, then announce that they may be suspended or delayed while I work out one-on-one deals.\"   \n   Earlier this week, the same four Republican senators joined Democrats to approve resolutions to terminate tariffs on Brazil and Canada that were announced using emergency powers. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., joined Democrats to terminate the Brazil tariffs, which he argued specifically had no rational basis.   \n   The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted against the measures, with many saying that at this point they're counterproductive to the president's tariff program. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Trump's new plans to lower China's tariffs Thursday were a good reminder. Trump announced the plans after meeting in South Korea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.    \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new trade deals,\" Crapo said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"Other deals are, hopefully, forthcoming.\"   However, the success of this week's resolution votes, which only needed a simple majority to pass, may not go far. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., installed a special rule to block such votes in the House, so they're currently unlikely to reach the floor. Even if they were to somehow pass the House, President Trump would almost certainly veto them.   Still, the vote marked a test of support for the president's tariff policies among Republicans, reflecting unease inside the party about their impacts on the U.S. economy, and specifically the farming and manufacturing sectors. It came ahead of arguments at the Supreme Court this fall in a case challenging Trump's authority to put sweeping tariffs in place using emergency powers.   \n   Thursday's vote wasn't the first time Senate Republicans took up Trump's authority to set global tariffs. In April, a similar measure failed 49 to 49. That same month, a measure to block tariffs on Canada drew a simple majority in the Senate.   \"Since then our nation's trade policy has looked pretty much like a dog chasing a squirrel,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a lead co-sponsor of the global tariffs resolution, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. \"More tariffs threatened, added, taken away, thousands of packages being destroyed because the customs service wasn't prepared, secretive deals to lift tariffs for certain companies and products that have influence at the White House.\"   \n   The Republicans who broke ranks did so despite a lobbying push by Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and urged them to back the president's policies. Vance told reporters after the lunch meeting that the tariffs are critical leverage for Trump in international negotiations.   But Tillis, for example, was one of those Republicans not convinced when it came at least to the Brazil tariffs.   \"I just don't think there's a rational basis for it,\" Tillis said.   Trump triggered the Brazil tariffs this summer to pressure the country's government to end what he called a \"witch hunt\" against his ally, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup to stay in power following his 2022 election defeat.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram and Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman about President Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Today, the two most powerful men in the world came face-to-face at a South Korean airport. We're talking about President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, their first meeting in six years. They talked tariffs, appeared to step back from the brink in what has amounted to Trump's economic war with China during his second term. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram has been traveling with the president. She's in South Korea today. Deepa joined me, along with NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman, on our national security podcast Sources & Methods. We talked through the summit, including the curveball that Trump delivered right before it got underway.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)KELLY: On Truth Social, President Trump wrote, and I quote, \"because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.\" Deepa, I think I can sum up the collective reaction here in Washington as, wait, what? What was the reaction there in Asia?DEEPA SHIVARAM: It was sort of one of those things that went out and we were like, oh, very focused on a Trump-Xi summit. And then all of a sudden, you know, in a very Trumpesque (ph) way, this other thing, like, flies out of left field.KELLY: Did it come up in the actual summit?SHIVARAM: It didn't. And it sort of - or if it did, we don't know that they spoke about it. And to be honest, like, there hasn't really been much follow-up. Like, we don't really know a lot of detail. What does an instruction to the Department of War/Defense look like? Where would testing take place, and what would Trump even want that to look like? So there's just - it's sort of one of those things that Trump fired off, and we're sort of left asking a lot more questions.KELLY: Tom, any details from the Pentagon? Any reaction?TOM BOWMAN: Well, first of all, the Pentagon doesn't do testing. It's done by a division of the Department of Energy called the National Nuclear Security Administration, No. 1. No. 2 is the testing site is in the Nevada desert. So even if you want to do testing, setting it up with diagnostic equipment and figuring out where you wanted to do it and what you wanted to do would take many months, I'm told, if not years.KELLY: So do we know why this was on President Trump's mind as he's walking into a big summit with Xi?BOWMAN: Well, we think it was precisely because Russia has tested these delivery systems - again, not weapons, just how you would deliver a nuclear weapon. So everyone's speculating that's precisely why he's doing it, because of what Putin announced.KELLY: OK. So let's go to what actually did get discussed at this summit and what we were expecting to be the big headlines, which have to do with trade, have to do with tariffs. Deepa, give us the very quick rundown on where they landed.SHIVARAM: Yeah. I would say it comes down to, like, a big three on this - like, the takeaways from this meeting. One is basically that China agreed to pull back on some of the limits they had put on rare earths exports. The other element was that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S. immediately, and that's, of course, been a major issue for American farmers since China halted those shipments. And then the other thing is that Trump said - this is the big number part - that tariffs on China would be lowered from 57% to 47%. And that 10% drop, Trump says, is because Xi committed to decrease the flow of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That is the reason that Trump said he would lower the tariff rate.KELLY: Yeah. The captain basic question, have we figured out what U.S. policy on China is, what the goal of all of the threats of tariffs and then walking back the threats of tariffs is?SHIVARAM: It's a really good question, and based on a lot of people I've talked to, there isn't exactly an answer. I did talk to Ryan Hass, who's the director of the China Center at Brookings, and he said that Trump policy is really different than his first term. But he said in the second term, it's essentially kind of like this.RYAN HASS: The China policy is the president's policy. He drives. He's in charge. And it's really not looked warmly upon if other people encroach upon his territory without his guidance or direction on how to do so.SHIVARAM: And think about how Trump does a lot of diplomacy, right? It's very personality oriented. It's very - you know, a lot of compliments, a lot of fanfare, and that is essentially how he's treated his relationship with Xi. Like, China is not a friend or ally to the United States. And he really, you know, kind of comes at this very big issue with sort of a personal diplomacy end to it. And of course, we know Xi does not really share that same level of diplomatic relations or diplomatic personality, I'll say.KELLY: NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram and Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.

Today's top stories   Tomorrow, many Americans will feel the impact of the government shutdown as SNAP food benefits will run out for about 42 million people. Saturday also marks the start of enrollment on federal insurance exchanges, and premiums are expected to more than double on average. Democrats say they'll vote to reopen the government if Congress extends health care subsidies to help manage the rising costs. Yesterday, major airlines asked Congress to pass the Republicans' stopgap funding plan as air traffic controllers continue to work without pay.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The air traffic control tower is seen at Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida early morning on Oct. 31. Flights at Orlando International Airport faced major delays on Oct. 30, after the Federal Aviation Administration said the airport had no certified air-traffic controllers in its tower, forcing arrivals to be halted or severely delayed amid the ongoing US government shutdown.\n                \n                    Miguel J.

Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Democrats have traditionally been hesitant to shut down the government, but don't appear to be backing down, NPR's Barbara Sprunt tells Up First. Democrats seem to think Republicans will take the blame for the shutdown and not them. They are hoping public pressure will build on the GOP over the expected rise in costs of health insurance premiums. Republicans say they are holding votes to fund the government and if Democrats care about funding nutrition aid and paying air traffic controllers, they would vote with them.   \n   SNAP benefits have never been cut off due to a shutdown, and now a federal judge is stepping in to decide whether to order the Trump administration to find ways to get people money to buy food. The Agriculture Department posted on its website that \"the well has run dry\" and stated in a memo that it doesn't have sufficient funds for SNAP benefits for next month and cannot legally use contingency funds. Democratic governors and attorneys general from about two dozen states sued, arguing that SNAP is an entitlement that cannot be simply cut off.    🎧 Even if the ruling comes soon, there will still be a delay in states receiving the funds they need, according to NPR's Jennifer Ludden. This is because the federal government sends funding to the states before the first of the month, and then it takes days to get it onto the debit-like cards that people use. An added complication is that the full SNAP funding for November is approximately $9 billion, but the administration reports that there is only about $5.5 billion in the contingency fund. Recalculating for partial payments could take weeks, resulting in people not only having to wait but also getting less money.   \n   President Trump announced yesterday that the U.S. would resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time in decades. Some experts believe that this decision would be a major escalation and could disrupt the nuclear balance of power.    🎧 The world's major nuclear powers have observed a testing moratorium since the 1990s as a goodwill gesture for stability after the Cold War, says NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The U.S. embarked on a program that utilizes science to ensure weapons function effectively without requiring testing. Much of that science happens in the same tunnels in the desert outside of Las Vegas where the government used to conduct nuclear testing. The U.S. has a significant technological advantage over Russia and China regarding nuclear weapons, but if those countries resume testing, they could narrow that gap, says Jon Wolfsthal at the Federation of American Scientists. There are also environmental concerns that even if radiation is contained underground, the shaking would be enough to damage buildings near the site.

In April, researchers released results from a study involving over 300 individuals age 50 and older who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease. The overall findings indicated that those who received the drug did not perform better than those given a placebo. However, in September, a further analysis of a subgroup of 125 participants revealed mild benefits for those who had only mild memory issues at the start of their treatment with the drug.    💊 By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. It is challenging, however, to assess the true impact of ALZ-801 due to the small sample size in the mild cognitive impairment group.💊 ALZ-801 could get special consideration from the Food and Drug Administration due to its potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market. The drug can be taken at home and does not cause swelling or bleeding in the brain, which often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment.💊 More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is expected to come from people who have continued to take the medicine after the initial 18-month study period ended, says David Watson, a co-author of the new study.   \n   Read more about the new findings about the Alzheimer's pill.

Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.    The impacts of the shutdown could soon get worse. That's because a number of federal programs are set to run out of money on Nov. 1. If that happens, tens of millions of people would lose federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps.   Also set to run out of funding are some Head Start programs, early-learning centers for low-income families, that serve more than 65,000 children nationwide.    \n   Read more about how food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse   The Agriculture Department says it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid.

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.    Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), joined by House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.)

Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR      What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   Of those at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November, 7 million receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC.) Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP are also expected to lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1.    In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.   As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, a coalition of more than two dozen Democratic state leaders are suing the Trump administration over its decision to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. A federal court decision in that case may come as soon as Thursday.   WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here. — and you can read more here about how food banks are bracing for it       What about Head Start?   Beginning Nov. 1, more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.   \n   Among the states hit hardest by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.   Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.   Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.   Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.   — Cory Turner and Kadin Mills, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People receive food for furloughed federal workers at No Limits Outreach Ministries on Oct. 21, 2025 in Hyattsville, Md.

Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.   The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.   By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.   The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.    The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.   Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.   \n   Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?   The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.   Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.      How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?    The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month.   Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A United States Postal Service (USPS) mail box stands in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 2020 in New York City.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.   \n   — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees   On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.   According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"   Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.   — Geoff Brumfiel, NPR   In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.      Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might   Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.   At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.   This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts have halted those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.   In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.   \n   — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Greg Freeman, a National Park Service ranger closes the entrance gate due to the government shutdown at the Everglades National Park Shark Valley on Oct. 1 in Florida. Shark Valley remains open to visitors who park outside the entrance gate and walk in, although with limited staffing.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   National Parks are a mixed bag   Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.   The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.   Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.   \n   But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.   Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted   Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.   \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\"   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to Noem; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An air traffic control tower at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Oct. 1 in Austin, Texas is seen following the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   If you're flying soon …   Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.    Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.   Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says there has been an uptick in the number of controllers who are calling in sick.   The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18, reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone. The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday.

Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.   Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:      Alaska   The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]   For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media.      Arizona   Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ] Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU]Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]      California   Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on, threatening to delay and stall food stamp benefits for millions of residents. [KQED]Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist]The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]      Colorado   Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut. [Colorado Public Radio]Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio] Several Colorado credit unions are already issuing Government Relief Loans to help workers make ends meet. These short-term loans charge no interest as long as they're paid off within six months. [Colorado Public Radio]    Coloradans: Been impacted by the federal government shutdown? Colorado Public Radio wants to hear from you.      Connecticut   Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [WSHU]      Georgia   For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]      Hawaii   University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees out of pocket during shutdown. Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded. UH has been able to pay them with internal funds, but it costs more than $20 million a pay period — every two weeks — for the system to match their salaries. [Hawaiʻi Public Radio]   For more on the impact in Hawai'i, head to Hawaiʻi Public Radio.      Illinois   Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]      Indiana   An estimated 24,000 civilians in Indiana work for the federal government. Gleaners Food Bank set up food distribution systems to help federal workers in Indiana impacted by the shutdown. [WFYI]      Iowa   Over 60,000 Iowans participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. [IPR]      Kansas   If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR]During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]   For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR.      Kentucky   Funding for food assistance benefits next month isn't coming, Gov. Andy Beshear said, due to the federal government shutdown. Funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is also delayed. [LPM]      Louisiana   The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]   For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF.      Maine   Nearly 170,000 Mainers, or over 12% of the state's total population, could lose food assistance if SNAP benefits are not funded for November. [Maine Public]Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it has still been busy at the park. [Maine Public]      Maryland   Prince George's County is home to more than 60,000 federal workers. The Capital Area Food Bank has been distributing food to federal workers affected by the shutdown. But the timing is a double burden: The Capital Area Food Bank has seen some of its own federal funding slashed even as demand skyrockets. [WAMU]      Massachusetts   While travelers across the U.S. are experiencing delays and cancellations as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown, it's mostly business as usual at Boston's Logan International Airport. [GBH]      Michigan   In response to how the federal shutdown will affect rural flights in Michigan, airport officials said they are continuing with \"business as usual.\" At least, for now. Federal funding for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program is set to extend only through Nov. 2. [Michigan Public]      Minnesota   Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News]      Missouri   Roughly 650,000 Missourians will not receive SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing government shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]      New Hampshire   SNAP serves more than 75,000 people in New Hampshire. And while state officials say they've received extra money to keep WIC running into November, it's unclear if SNAP will also be funded. [NHPR]On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR]   For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR.

But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]      Pennsylvania   Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]      Tennessee   On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]      Texas   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food purchasing support to approximately 3.5 million Texans, including more than 1.7 million children. Those benefits amount to around $617 million per month. [KUT]U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]      Utah   In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER)      Vermont   If SNAP benefits run out at the end of the month, 63,000 Vermonters would lose their benefits. SNAP dollars fund the Vermont program 3SquaresVT.

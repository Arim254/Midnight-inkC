His desire for the big (peace) prize and cementing his legacy as a dealmaker drive his effort.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  President Trump is sending representatives to Moscow and Kyiv to work out a way to end the war in Ukraine. One of his aides is the subject of a new report from Bloomberg. Bloomberg published a transcript of a phone call in which the aide advises a Russian official about how Russia can handle the emotions of Donald Trump. NPR has not confirmed this transcript. And in a moment, we will hear Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia. We begin with the negotiations.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez is here to talk about why Trump continues to push even after all these setbacks. Franco, good morning.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So the original 28-point plan was widely criticized as a wish list by the Russians. Now the administration says it's updated. Where do things stand now?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. The Trump administration has been furiously negotiating with both sides, bouncing between a Russia-friendly version and a more Ukraine-friendly one. And Trump now says there are only a few remaining points of disagreement. He said last night he's dispatching his special envoy, Steve Witkoff - Witkoff is the Trump negotiator who is on that transcript - and maybe son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow to meet with President Putin. And then he's sending Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with the Ukrainians.MARTIN: But, you know, Franco, we've been here before. Do we have a sense of whether this is really progress?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, talks are happening and ideas are being exchanged. That's something. I mean, it's more than what was happening a few weeks ago. But are they closer to reaching a deal? I mean, not necessarily. I mean, I was talking with Ivo Daalder, who was the ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration. And he says, basically, last week, you had Russia agreeing to one plan, and now you have Ukraine agreeing to a different plan.IVO DAALDER: The problem is Ukraine and Russia don't agree. So you can come up with any plan that the U.S. and Russia can agree on and any plan that the U.S. and Ukraine can agree on. That's not the same as having a plan that Ukraine and Russia can agree on. And that's their problem.MARTIN: Last week, President Trump seemed to set this take-it-or-leave-it deadline for Thanksgiving, but he did back off that over the weekend. What does that tell you about his motivations?ORDOÑEZ: Well, I mean, it's another example of how driven Trump is to just get to yes in any way possible. Richard Fontaine served in the George W. Bush White House and now runs the Center for a New American Security. And he told me that what matters to Ukraine and Russia doesn't so much matter to Trump.RICHARD FONTAINE: Trump clearly wants a deal. I don't know that the content of the deal matters all that much to him as long as it stops the fighting. That, therefore, gives a lot of leeway to those negotiating what the terms of that deal are. And, of course, for Ukraine and for the Russians and for the Europeans and for many people, the terms are all-important.ORDOÑEZ: Terms are very important, and that's why Russia wants more of the eastern Donbas region for strategic and economic benefits. And it's also why Ukraine wants clear security guarantees from Western partners like the U.S. to ensure that Russia never invades again.MARTIN: You know, people might remember that Trump talks a lot about the conflicts that he says he has ended. He did that yesterday during the Thanksgiving turkey pardons. How much of this is about his quest for the Nobel Peace Prize?ORDOÑEZ: Look, I mean, I think he genuinely cares about the loss of life. It's something he frequently mentions when talking about the war. But I don't think you can discount his desire for recognition. I mean, he talks about the Nobel Peace Prize a lot. His aides talk about it as well. And Daalder and Fontaine both told me that Trump is likely looking at his legacy. And as any president would, I mean, what better way to be seen as the ultimate dealmaker than solving this intractable war?MARTIN: That is White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Franco, thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Michel.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The video was published as legal questions swirl around the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities.   While the White House has since walked back the president's remarks calling the Senators' video \"seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH,\" Kelly told All Things Considered he thinks President Trump is \"declaring that loyalty to the Constitution is punishable by death.\"   \n   Listen to the full interview by clicking play on the blue box above.\n",

    "body": "\n      In Tennessee, a special election for a vacant congressional seat is expected to be more competitive in a district that has been strongly Republican for years.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  After Democrats won elections this month in New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the party is now eyeing a race in Tennessee. The special congressional election is for a district that has been solidly Republican for decades, but is now more competitive. Early voting is already underway. So, Marianna Bacallao for member station WPLN in Nashville headed to the polls to check in with voters.MARIANNA BACALLAO, BYLINE: Overlooking U.S. Route 70 and the neighboring Dollar General, the city hall of Pegram, Tennessee, has opened its doors as an early voting site. It's one of many in the state's 7th congressional district, which is holding a special election that concludes on December 2. Here in Cheatham County, President Trump won with 72% of the vote last year.Trump endorsed the Republican congressional candidate Matt Van Epps. Some voters say they cast a ballot for the former state commissioner because...PAM: There's a lot of work to do because a lot of work didn't get done four years ago.MICHAEL: Making sure that President Trump has the support he needs to carry out his agenda.JEFF: I just like the moral values. I like to get away from the issues of transgenderism and homosexuality, and I like somebody that's backing the way Trump's got the country going.BACALLAO: That was Pam, Michael and Jeff. All three refused to give their last names because they wanted to keep their ballot choices private. But not everyone in Cheatham County is happy.BECKY: I don't know how you could say the price of groceries or anything are coming down unless you've not been to the grocery store. Everything's more expensive.BACALLAO: That's Becky, who also wanted to keep her last name private. She says she voted for Democratic congressional candidate Aftyn Behn because she's worried about her daughter who's just graduated college.BECKY: And she has no chance of being able to live on her own. Everything is expensive.BACALLAO: She's not alone. Affordability is top of mind for Nashville voters, along with...ABRAHAM GARCIA ORTEGA: Safety, money, jobs.JASMINE PATTERSON: Housing.ORTEGA: Inflation is outrageous, you know?BACALLAO: That was Abraham Garcia Ortega and Jasmine Patterson. They also cast their vote for Behn, a state lawmaker. She and Van Epps are vying for a seat left open by the retirement of Congressman Mark Green. While Green has held the seat since 2019, his surprise retirement could present an opportunity for Democrats.This month, the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter, changed the 7th Congressional district's rating from solidly Republican to likely Republican. The state's GOP chair, Scott Golden, says he's focused on turnout at a time when many voters may be traveling or hosting for the holidays.SCOTT GOLDEN: Anytime you have a special election bracketed by the Thanksgiving holiday, you can't afford to take a day off. You know, I think if there's concern, it's just that, you know, people aren't aware that they have the opportunity to vote right now.BACALLAO: Recent Democratic wins across the country may also help build momentum for their candidate, even in a district that's been a Republican stronghold for decades. Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Rachel Campbell says Behn's focus on affordability, like the cost of groceries, could give her an edge.RACHEL CAMPBELL: My belief is that we're winning because we're focused on the real issues that families are facing, not just in Tennessee, but all across the country.BACALLAO: A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that nationwide, nearly 6 in 10 respondents say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices - and no other issue comes close. Trump is unpopular nationwide with an approval rating of 39%. In Tennessee, though, his base is still strong.

    "body": "\n      Party identity is shifting under President Trump, and the process is affecting both parties.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democrats and Republicans promised different visions of the role of government. For decades, it seemed clear what each party stood for, but those lines are becoming less and less clear as President Trump continues to rewrite the rules in Washington. So we've asked senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt to help us make sense of how these parties are shifting. Welcome.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: So, I mean, for decades, it seemed incredibly clear what each party believed. It was big government versus small government, intervention versus isolation. But now it just feels like those lines are getting incredibly, incredibly blurrier. What is happening here?SPRUNT: Yeah. I mean, if you saw an R or a D next to someone's name, you could generally guess what that person's political philosophy was. You know, it was a pretty fair proxy. Democrats - government isn't a problem but a solution. Republicans favor small government, more socially conservative. But that has changed in a really big way in the Trump era. I talked to David Barker, a professor of government at American University. He says it's no longer entirely clear what exactly it means to be a conservative anymore.DAVID BARKER: People - I tend to associate the term with just being, like, really pro-Trump, but there are a lot of elements to the MAGA right that are largely or wholly inconsistent with what we used to think of as conservatism in the Reagan and Bush eras.KEITH: And in the second Trump term, these differences are even more stark. Republicans used to be all about free markets and free trade. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs. In business, he picks winners and losers and has even pushed for the government to take a portion of certain companies. When it comes to foreign policy, Trump has had little use for long-standing alliances, but America First hasn't meant pure isolationism. Look at the strikes on the Iranian nuclear facilities or the buildup of U.S. military might near Venezuela happening now.SUMMERS: And all of this, of course, makes me think about Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who, of course, used to be one of Trump's closest allies, but she announced last week that she is going to step down in January. And that decision - all of this - it's about her disagreements with President Trump. How does she fit into all of this?KEITH: Well, it would be hard to find someone more MAGA than Congresswoman Greene. But in the past few months, she had begun to openly question whether Trump was living up to his campaign promises. So he turned on her, called her a traitor, promised to primary her, and she quit. Greene is an iconoclast. She says she never really fit in in Congress, but she's casting herself as a representative of common Americans, the very people who Trump's version of the Republican Party appealed to, the working-class voters who gave him a winning coalition.SPRUNT: Yeah. And, you know, Greene started to talk a lot about these issues that were important to the base - affordability, no foreign intervention and, of course, the Epstein files. She defended those as being core to MAGA. So this presents an interesting question, I think, about the movement itself. Is it about that core set of values, or is it about the man himself?SUMMERS: I mean, it makes sense that Trump's shifting vision is upending his Republican Party, but Democrats also seem to be struggling to define themselves right now. What are each of you seeing?SPRUNT: As Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image, you know, so have Democrats sort of centered their party on being anti-Trump, and a byproduct of that is that the party has less identity outside of just opposing Trump. For a lot of moderate and independent voters, and to be honest, some Democratic voters I talk to as well, just being anti-Trump isn't enough.KEITH: Trump is the main character in everyone's political lives right now, and that puts Democrats in a position of always responding to him.SUMMERS: The next political test, of course, is next fall in the midterm elections. How are Republicans and Democrats thinking about who their parties are going forward?SPRUNT: Well, the party is shaped by who runs and who wins, right? So I talked to the folks running recruitment efforts in the House on both sides of the aisle. Georgia Congressman Brian Jack is leading recruitment for Republicans, and I asked him, what does the party stand for?BRIAN JACK: Ultimately, I think, for many people, the Republican Party today has been completely overhauled by President Trump in a positive way because it's a party of blue-collar, working-class folks who want to see our country put first.SPRUNT: And this gets at another way that Trump has transformed the parties. I mean, Democrats have lost their lock on white, working-class voters.KEITH: It is remarkable just how significantly the party's electorates have changed in the past few decades. Bill Clinton, in the 1990s, was elected by a coalition that included a whole lot of working-class, white voters. Republicans were the party of the elites. And then Trump came along, and now it's almost completely reversed. Steve Teles is a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University.STEVE TELES: There's this tension between all the things people had previously committed to and the fact that now, like, all these things are shaken up in terms of who's in what coalition.KEITH: And he says there's a really big question of whether those voters will stay with Republicans once Trump is gone.SUMMERS: OK. So that was Republicans. Barbara, you mentioned that you talked to both parties about this. How did Democrats respond?SPRUNT: Well, I asked Colorado Congressman Jason Crow, who's leading recruitment for the Democratic side, what does he think the party stands for?JASON CROW: I'm not looking for government to solve my problems. I'm not looking for a handout. What I want is a level playing field. Working-class Americans - they all know it's rigged, right? So I'm a Democrat because this is the party that consistently tries to unrig that system.SPRUNT: Now, Juana, if you didn't know that that was a Democrat, what would those first few lines make you think of - you know, like, working-class, not looking for a government handout? I'm betting that, you know, you might say Republican.SUMMERS: I might. I mean, hearing Congressman Crow say that, it's a little surprising given the large and very vocal left wing of his party.SPRUNT: Yeah. And he's certainly a centrist Democrat. But the language around unrigging the system is also very much in line with the far-left of the party too. Unlike the Republican Party, navigating what conservatism means and what MAGA means from a policy level, the challenge for Democrats is different. It's about how to rebuild key parts of their party, like the working-class that we talked about.KEITH: And how they rebuild trust with voters. There are a lot of people who feel like the system just isn't working for them, and electoral success for Democrats and Republicans alike may well come down to who most persuasively can say, we hear you and here's a solution.SUMMERS: That's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Thanks to both of you.KEITH: You're welcome.SPRUNT: Thank you, Juana.SUMMERS: And for a deeper dive on all of this, take a listen to today's NPR Politics Podcast.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR traveled to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Georgia district to hear what her constituents thought about their congresswoman's decision to resign next year after a falling out with President Trump.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently announced that she is stepping down from her seat mid-term. Her last day in office will be January 5. The decision came after a simmering feud between Representative Greene and President Trump over the Epstein files and other issues. Greene, of course, rose to national fame as a staunch backer of Trump and the MAGA movement. But in recent weeks, Trump revoked his endorsement of her. Greene said that she did not want her district to have to endure a, quote, \"hateful primary.\" Georgia Public Broadcasting's Sarah Kallis traveled to Greene's northwest Georgia district after she announced her resignation to see what her constituents had to say. Sarah, thanks for being on the line.SARAH KALLIS, BYLINE: Thank you for having me.DETROW: So I'm curious - what was the mood like in the district?KALLIS: Well, it's safe to say that people were shocked by her announcement. I noticed that people were very hesitant to talk to press. I actually went up to her district two days before she announced her resignation as well. And when I went up then, constituents were coming up to me. They wanted to give their opinion and their name. But this time when I went up, very few people wanted to talk, and even fewer wanted to give a name or any identifying information. Some of them said they were worried about family backlash, especially with the upcoming holiday.DETROW: Tell us about what the people who did talk to you said, though.KALLIS: Well, again, folks were definitely very surprised, and it's important to note here that she's very popular in her district. They voted overwhelmingly for both her and President Trump in 2024. Here is Floyd Farless from Rome, which is Greene's hometown, who said he voted for her last year.FLOYD FARLESS: I wish she had not done it at this situation. It does leave us without representation till somebody's appointed. She has been somewhat of a firebrand, but every area has got their own. And she would have been reelected, for sure, here. I don't think there'd be any question about it.KALLIS: And it's important to note here that Farless used the word appointed, but that seat will actually be vacant until a special election is called when voters will select a new representative, and they are sworn in.DETROW: Curious what else you heard from voters.KALLIS: Well, constituents represented a pretty wide range of opinions. You know, some said that they support her doing what she needs to do. They had some theories that she might be concerned about her personal safety. And then there were some others that echoed Farless' concerns, especially about the lack of representation in Congress in between that period where she resigns and the special election happens to replace her. And that likely would be sometime in February. And some constituents also cited some unfounded conspiracy theories about her resignation, which include some claims that the Democratic Party undermined her. And it's important to note here that Greene rose to prominence for pushing conspiracy theories like QAnon when she first ran in 2020.DETROW: So that's voters. What about local Republican Party leaders?KALLIS: So the GOP chair for Greene's district, Jackie Harling, said that she was shocked and saddened as well, which definitely seems to be the theme here, but she understands her decision ultimately.JACKIE HARLING: I do not blame her for making the choice to basically jump out of the torture chamber. When your family is threatened, it's a whole different ball of wax.KALLIS: Greene has said that she's received death threats throughout her time in Congress. And Harling says that she still fully supports President Trump, but she also told me that the rift between Trump and Greene has been pretty difficult for her.HARLING: I still support him. I am a big believer in showing grace and forgiveness.KALLIS: And now attention for Harling and the district GOP is turning to the special election that's going to happen early next year.DETROW: What else can you tell us about that campaign in its earliest days?KALLIS: Well, it's the most conservative district in Georgia, and there won't be a primary because of Georgia laws. So a crowded field is definitely possible in this race, with candidates on both sides of the aisle. And if no one gets that 50% of the vote, it's going to have to go to a runoff, which would leave the district without representation in Washington for even longer. And Congressman Greene said on social media that she's not going to endorse in this race. But Trump has been pretty active in endorsements in congressional races, so it's possible he'll endorse here.DETROW: That is Georgia Public Broadcasting's Sarah Kallis. Thank you so much.KALLIS: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Trump dismissed any concerns as \"a standard thing.\"   \"Because he's got to sell this to Ukraine. He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia,\" Trump said, aboard Air Force One, on his way to Florida. \"That's what a dealmaker does.\"   The controversy has shined a new spotlight on Witkoff, the president's long-time friend and chief negotiator who has drawn criticism for his lack of experience and go-it-alone style.   \n   The recording is of an October call in the lead up to the release of the original 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine that favored Russia.   Bloomberg reviewed audio of the call and published a transcript. NPR has not independently verified the transcript or call audio.   Trump said Tuesday night he hadn't heard the audio, but also did not have a problem with the characterization of the call.   \"You got to say, 'look, they want this. You've got to convince them with this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation,\" he said.   The criticism has been blunt: That Witkoff is not looking for a balanced deal, but carrying water for Russia — a U.S. adversary and the aggressor in a war versus Ukraine, a strategic partner and European ally.   But Trump doesn't seem too concerned. He's sending Witkoff back to Moscow to try to finalize details of the latest plan with Putin.   Trump and Witkoff have a long friendship   Witkoff and the president have been friends for almost 40 years. Trump calls Witkoff \"a special guy\" and \"my pal.\" Their friendship dates back to a chance encounter at a New York Deli at 3 a.m.   Trump had no cash on him. \"I ordered him a ham and swiss,\" Witkoff said, according to a report in Courthouse News about his testimony in Trump's defense during one of Trump's trials last year.   \n   Witkoff said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that he learned the real estate business from Trump.   \"I wanted to be him,\" Witkoff said. \"Everybody wanted to be him. He'd come to 101 Park Avenue, where I was a lawyer. He had this swashbuckling style. I used to see him come in and I used to say, 'God, I want to be him.'\"   Witkoff has described how Trump was there for him when one of his sons died from an opioid overdose in 2011.   \"I have seen his humanity in the quiet moments away from the spotlight in hospital rooms he didn't have to be in — where his presence brought real solace in a dark hour for my family,\" Witkoff said at the Republican National Convention.   During the campaign, Witkoff helped with fundraising. Trump also turned to Witkoff to handle sensitive matters like trying to repair ties with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and presidential primary challenger Nikki Haley.   \"His best friend, Steve Witkoff, came to our house in South Carolina, spoke to me and my husband, and basically wanted a truce between me and Donald Trump,\" Haley said on her podcast. She told Witkoff that Trump had her support.   Picking Witkoff for a role his son-in-law used to fill   Well before assigning him the Ukraine peace deal, Trump picked his old friend as his envoy to the Middle East.   It was the same position that Trump — in his first term — had given to another person whose loyalty was unquestioned: his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   Kushner, who now runs an investment firm, had also come from the real estate world and handled many tough files for Trump, including Middle East peace, trade talks with Mexico and Canada, immigration reform and parts of the administration's response to the COVID pandemic.   In President Trump's first term, his son-in-law Jared Kushner held the role now filled by Steve Witkoff. Kushner and Witkoff appeared together on Feb. 20 at a Miami conference organized by the non-profit arm of Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund called the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute.   \n   A lot of experts scoffed at Kushner's lack of experience when he started his White House role, and some raised the same questions about Witkoff.   How Witkoff describes his approach to negotiations   The White House has described Witkoff as a trusted friend of the president who left behind a massive business enterprise to serve the country. He doesn't take a salary and pays for his own travel.   Witkoff is certainly no stranger to creating some Russia-related controversy.   Earlier this year, Witkoff raised eyebrows after appearing on Tucker Carlson's podcast and said Putin was \"not a bad guy.\"   In the same interview, Witkoff explained his approach to negotiations. \"There's no doubt I'm always trying to put myself in the shoes of the other person because a good deal has to work fair for everybody,\" he said.   Don Peebles, the real estate entrepreneur, told NPR this spring that he had seen that attitude firsthand during adversarial talks with Witkoff.   \"If I were going to summarize his approach is to find what the other person, other side, wants — and to try to give it to him,\" said Peebles, who fundraised for former President Barack Obama.   Peebles said he thinks Witkoff probably has more high stakes negotiating experience than most diplomats.   He remembers being forced to deal with Witkoff on a big real estate transaction in New York. Peebles considered walking away. He felt like he had a gun to his head, but never by Witkoff.   Witkoff defused the situation, promising not to be disruptive and explained how they would both be better off as partners, Peebles recalled.   \"He took a very adversarial situation from my perspective and not only got the deal done, but we've been friends ever since.\"   War in Ukraine is not the same as a real estate deal   But solving the war in Ukraine is incredibly complex.   \n   Even negotiating giants such as Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker would have a tough time convincing Putin to lay down his arms, according to Aaron David Miller, who has served as a negotiator and analyst for both Republican and Democratic administrations.   \"Deals are cut when there is urgency,\" said Miller, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"And urgency is a function of two things: How much pain the parties are under and what are the prospects for gain right now.\"   Miller said that urgency requires a mediator who is prepared \"to use honey and vinegar,\" or incentives and disincentives to produce something that both Putin and Zelensky will be able to rationalize — as well as sell to their own people.   \"I just don't see Putin ready to make the kinds of concessions that would be required to anchor this thing and make it work,\" Miller said.\n",

Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, moved to end the prosecution against the remaining defendants after he assumed the case from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was disqualified by a court late last year.   \"The criminal conduct alleged in the Atlanta Judicial Circuit's prosecution was conceived in Washington, D.C., not the State of Georgia,\" Skandalakis wrote in his motion to dismiss. \"The federal government is the appropriate venue for this prosecution, not the State of Georgia.\"   \n   The prosecution was the last outstanding criminal case against Trump, after a pair of federal prosecutions — one focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and another related to the handling of classified documents — were dropped after Trump returned to the White House earlier this year.   Trump cheered the ruling on social media, writing that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia, as the corrupt Fani Willis Witch Hunt against me, and other Great American Patriots, has been DISMISSED in its entirety.\"   \n   The Fulton County DA's office has not responded to a request for comment.   The historic indictment   In Georgia, a Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, in August 2023 in a sweeping racketeering case alleging a conspiracy to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia.   The case was spurred in part by a January 2021 recorded phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he asked him to \"find\" 11,780 votes, one more than the margin of Trump's loss in Georgia.   The Georgia case also focused on an alleged scheme to submit a slate of Trump electors despite Biden's victory, to access sensitive voting machine data and an unsuccessful campaign to pressure state officials to interfere with the election result.   \n   After the grand jury indictment, Trump and his codefendants were booked at the Fulton County Jail — with Trump's mug shot becoming a lasting image of the case. Most defendants, including Trump, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Four accepted plea deals — and those remain binding.   The sprawling case was winding its way to trial when attorneys for one of Trump's codefendants filed a motion to dismiss the case premised on a stunning claim: The district attorney had been engaged in an improper personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired for the case.   Willis acknowledged the relationship had existed, but asserted it had no bearing on the case.   Judge McAfee ultimately ruled that Willis could continue on if the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned. But a few months later, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed that ruling, removing Willis and her office from the case. The Georgia Supreme Court later declined to hear an appeal, letting the removal stand.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the Georgia election interference case at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta.\n                \n                    Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Skandalakis, a nonpartisan official who Georgia law charged with appointing a special prosecutor, announced in November that he would take the case himself after he was unable to recruit anyone else to assume the case.   \"It's important that someone makes a decision on this case,\" Skandalakis said in a September interview. \"It's important for the public, frankly for the nation, for the defendants, for all the interested parties.\"   That did not mean his decision would be to proceed with the prosecution. While the state charges were insulated in ways that the charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice were not, Trump's lawyers had argued that the case could not continue until he left office in 2029.   The decision now to drop the charges entirely means the case will not proceed even then.   \"This decision will not be universally popular\"   Skandalakis said in making the decision, he would meticulously review the indictment, the law and the case files, including 101 banker boxes of documents and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.   \n   Among the options Skandalakis could have considered included dropping the charges against Trump but continuing the case against some or all of his codefendants, or going back to a grand jury for a superseding or updated indictment. The statute of limitations for most felony charges in Georgia is four years and five years for racketeering charges.   Skandalakis stressed that it would be impractical to continue the prosecution. He did say that charges related to Ruby Freeman, a Georgia election worker who faced threats and harassment after being falsely accused of fraud, could continue — but should be brought in Cobb, not Fulton, County.   While cases against some Trump allies involved in efforts to overturn the election continue in other state courts, the Georgia decision brings to a close one of the most high-profile and wide-reaching prosecutions.   Georgia State University Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis disagrees with Skandalakis' finding that there was not a role for the state justice system in this case.   Kreis said states play a crucial part in accountability in election cases because unlike in federal cases, a president cannot pardon people for state charges.   He also said this decision could weaken deterrents, meaning it will be more up to individuals, like secretaries of state, to step in and stop attempts to interfere with election results, rather than the legal system.   And Kreis said a trial would have been a chance for the public to hear the evidence for themselves.   \"This was really an opportunity for justice and reconciliation and a kind of truth-telling that has been squandered,\" Kreis said.   In his motion, Skandalakis wrote: \"I recognize that, given the deep political divisions in our country, this decision will not be universally popular.\" He said his family received threats after he took over the case.   \"The role of a prosecutor is not to satisfy public opinion or achieve universal approval; such a goal is both unattainable and irrelevant to the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion,\" he continued. \"My assessment of this case has been guided solely by the evidence, the law, and the principles of justice.\"\n",

He said the birds should be named Chuck and Nancy — after Democratic stalwarts Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi — but \"I would never pardon those people.\"   Trump claimed that last year's turkey pardons, issued by President Joe Biden, were invalid because he used an autopen. \"Where's Hunter?\" he said, suggesting that his predecessor's son could once again face legal jeopardy.   \n   And all of that was before Trump turned his attention to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has resisted the White House's plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.   Trump said he had a joke prepared about Pritzker, but \"I refuse to talk about the fact that he's a fat slob. I don't mention it.\"   Scattered laughter rippled through the audience, which sat under cloudy skies and an intermittent drizzle on the Rose Garden patio.   Trump eventually got around to the business at hand, which was pardoning the turkeys Gobble and Waddle. Both were spared the dinner table, but only one got the spotlight.   \"Gobble, I just want to tell you this — very important — you are hereby unconditionally pardoned,\" Trump said. He reached over to run his hand over the feathers, saying, \"Who would want to harm this beautiful bird?\"   Waddle had previously been spotted in the White House briefing room.   \"Waddle, want to give us a gobble?\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asked.   The turkey obliged.   \"Very on message!\" Leavitt said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump pardons national Thanksgiving turkey Gobble during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, on Tuesday, in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump used part of his ceremonial remarks to insist that the price of Thanksgiving meals was dropping under his leadership, although his numbers are misleading. Some research indicates that holiday dinners could cost more this year, a reminder of persistent frustration with inflation.   \n   The president plans to fly south to his private Florida resort later Tuesday, a holiday interlude during what has been a turbulent and uncertain chapter of his second term.   Trump is struggling to advance a plan to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine after an earlier version faced swift criticism from European allies and even some Republicans. The U.S. military is also poised to target Venezuela with military strikes, part of an anti-drug operation that could ultimately destabilize the country's leadership.   In Washington, Trump faces the possibility of a splintering Republican coalition ahead of next year's midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. Some members of his party already took the rare step of crossing the president by successfully pushing legislation to force the Justice Department to release more documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.   \n   Trump faced a setback in court this week when a federal judge tossed cases against James Comey and Letitia James, two targets of the president's retribution campaign.   Comey, a former FBI director whom Trump fired during his first term, was charged with making a false statement and obstructing Congress. James, the New York attorney general who investigated the president between his two terms, was charged with mortgage fraud.   Both pleaded not guilty and said the prosecutions were politically motivated, pointing to Trump's public demands for the Justice Department to punish his enemies.   The judge said the interim U.S. attorney, a former member of Trump's personal legal team, who obtained the indictments was illegally appointed. However, the decision was made without prejudice, so the Justice Department could try again to charge Comey and James.   The White House plans to be open for holiday tours. However, despite the arrival of a Christmas tree via horse-drawn carriage on Monday, the presidential residence will be much different this year.   \n   Trump's decision to demolish the building's East Wing to make room for a new ballroom has turned part of the White House grounds into a construction site.\n",

That prosecutor is Lindsey Halligan, a 36-year-old former insurance attorney who served as one of President Trump's personal lawyers after his first term and joined his second administration as a White House aide.   Trump appointed Halligan as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in late September, the day after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from the president to bring charges against Comey and James.   \n   In his announcement, Trump called Halligan a \"tough, smart and loyal attorney\" who \"has the strength and determination to be absolutely OUTSTANDING in this new and very important role.\"   But Halligan's tenure has been mired in controversy, reaching new highs on Monday when U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled in dual opinions that Halligan's appointment was unlawful.   The judge found that Halligan's appointment violated a federal statute that limits interim U.S. attorneys to 120 days in the role, because Siebert had been in that acting role since January. After 120 days without a Senate confirmation, only district courts — not the Attorney General — can fill a vacancy.   \n   Currie wrote that Halligan, whom she describes as \"a former White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience,\" had \"no lawful authority to present the indictment\" against Comey or James. Because Halligan's was the only signature on those documents, they are rendered invalid.   \"All actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie wrote.   The ruling leaves the door open for the Justice Department to appeal, which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it will. In an interview Monday on Fox News, she downplayed the decision as a \"technical ruling\" and defended Halligan's authority.   \n   \"We believe that the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position but she was in fact legally appointed,\" Leavitt said.   Here's what to know about the prosecutor at the center of this latest political storm.   Halligan got her start in insurance law    Halligan grew up in Broomfield, Colo., a suburb about halfway between Denver and Boulder. She played softball and basketball and competed in several Miss Colorado USA pageants, earning third runner-up in 2009.   She studied politics and broadcast journalism at Regis University, the Jesuit school in Denver that Erika Kirk also attended. According to one professional biography, Halligan developed an interest in law while interning at the Denver City Attorney's Office in college.   She got her law degree from the University of Miami in 2013, interning at the Miami-Dade Public Defender's Office and the law school's Miami Innocence Clinic along the way. She began her legal career at the Florida firm Cole, Scott & Kissane, which specializes in insurance defense litigation.   \n   Halligan became a partner at the firm in 2018 and, the following year, won praise for defeating a $500,000 property damage claim involving a leaky roof (\"George and Lindsey presented evidence that the roof was old and just past its normal life expectancy,\" the firm said in a news release at the time).   Halligan told the Washington Post earlier this year that she first met Trump at a November 2021 event at his golf club in West Palm Beach — months after his first term ended, as he was under investigation by both the Justice Department and New York State.   \"I saw the same thing that I saw when I interned at the Innocence clinic: someone who was getting railroaded by the system,\" Halligan told the newspaper.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Halligan, then part of Trump's personal legal team, leaves a court hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September 2022.\n                \n                    Marco Bello/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Marco Bello/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Halligan went from personal lawyer to the president's assistant   Halligan joined Trump's personal legal team in 2022.   \n   \"As a Partner at the biggest Law Firm in Florida, Lindsey proved herself to be a tremendous trial lawyer, and later represented me (and WON!) in the disgraceful Democrat Documents Hoax, as well as MANY other major, high profile cases,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in September.   Halligan and Trump have both said that she was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 when the FBI raided the property as part of its investigation into his retention of classified documents. She helped defend him in that case, both in court and on TV.   A Trump-appointed federal judge ultimately dismissed it in July 2024, ruling the prosecutor had been unlawfully appointed, and the Justice Department dropped its appeal after Trump was reelected.   When Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, Halligan joined his administration with two titles: White House senior associate staff secretary and special assistant to the president.   Halligan remained visible, frequently appearing with him in the Oval Office and at the U.S. Open.   One of her most visible White House contributions was leading its controversial review of more than half a dozen Smithsonian Institution museums to \"ensure alignment\" with Trump's cultural directives. The Organization of American Historians has called the order, which was issued in August, an \"unacceptable instance of ongoing executive overreach.\"   Halligan has defended and taken credit for it, telling The Washington Post that when she moved to D.C. ahead of Trump's inauguration, some of the museum exhibits she visited struck her as \"weaponizing history.\"   \"And so I talked to the president about it,\" Halligan said, \"and suggested an executive order, and he gave me his blessing, and here we are.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Halligan stands next to other White House aides including Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf as President Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office in February.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Halligan is accused of missteps in the dropped cases   While the Comey and James cases were thrown out because of Halligan's lack of authority, their lawyers — as well as outside legal experts — accused Halligan of legal missteps in her effort to prosecute Trump's political enemies.   \n   Halligan's predecessor, Siebert, had resisted bringing charges against both officials because of insufficient evidence. At the time, his office had already opened an investigation into James over bank fraud allegations related to a 2020 mortgage application for a Virginia property. Siebert's resignation came hours after Trump told reporters that he wanted the prosecutor \"out.\"   \n   Trump announced Halligan's appointment the following day. That's also the day Trump posted — and later deleted — a message on social media appearing to pressure Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate his political rivals: Comey, James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.   Bondi's office issued an order authorizing Halligan for the interim U.S. attorney job less than 48 hours later, on Sept. 22. Halligan's office announced on Sept. 25 that a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Comey with making a false statement and obstruction over 2020 Senate testimony.   That announcement came five days before the statute of limitations would have expired in Comey's case — and on Halligan's fourth day on the job.   \"She started on a Monday — this was a Thursday — and tried to get this indictment in a case,\" former federal prosecutor Elie Honig told NPR's Morning Edition. \"I will tell you, if I went into a grand jury on my fourth day on the job and tried to indict a complicated, high-stakes case like this too, I'm sure I would've screwed up as well.\"   \n   In the weeks since, the grand jury process has been the subject of growing legal questions. Earlier this month, a magistrate judge took the unusual step of ordering the Justice Department to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.\"   Scrutiny further increased after a hearing last week, at which Halligan confirmed that the full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment against Comey — a shocking revelation that could be enough to get the case dismissed, though a prosecutor at the hearing downplayed it as a \"paperwork error.\"   \n   Halligan initially sought three counts against Comey, but the grand jury rejected one of them. Then Halligan or someone else created a new indictment with renumbered charges but didn't bring that back to the grand jury for a vote, a step that Honig said \"any semi-experienced prosecutor\" would know not to skip.   \"It would take 10 minutes,\" he added. \"Instead, she just brings it to the judge with two grand jurors with her, which is not enough. And now she's created this problem for herself out of a sheer lack of competence.\"   Days later, a judge threw the case out for an entirely different reason.\n",

    "body": "\n    TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Joyce Vance, is worried about whether American democracy is sturdy enough to withstand what she describes as the antidemocratic moves that President Donald Trump and his administration have spewed out with overwhelming force and velocity. In her new book, she writes about how to save the republic and what we can accomplish in the future if we renew our commitment to democracy. For people who are wondering - but what can I do? - she has suggestions. Her new bestselling book is titled \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual For Keeping A Democracy.\"You may know Vance as a longtime legal analyst for MSNBC, which has been rebranded as MS NOW. After 25 years as a career federal prosecutor, she was appointed by President Obama as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, a position she held throughout his presidency. She resigned in 2017, a day before Trump's first inauguration. She also writes the Civil Discourse newsletter on Substack, co-hosts two podcasts - SistersInLaw and CAFE Insider - and is a distinguished professor of the practice of law at the University of Alabama School of Law.Let's start with a clip dating back to last March, when Judge James Boasberg had ordered the Trump administration to turn around deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants heading to El Salvador. When those flights did not turn around, it raised the question whether the administration was defying the judge's orders. Trump was asked whether he would ever defy a court order in an interview on Laura Ingraham's Fox News show \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Here's Trump's response.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I never did defy a court order.LAURA INGRAHAM: And you wouldn't in the future?TRUMP: No. I - you can't do that. However, we have bad judges. We have very bad judges, and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think they - I think at a certain point, you have to start looking at, what do you do when you have a rogue judge? The judge that we're talking about - he's - you look at his other rulings, I mean, rulings unrelated. But having to do with me, he's a lunatic.GROSS: Joyce Vance, welcome to FRESH AIR.JOYCE VANCE: Thank you for having me.GROSS: How do you interpret the clip we just heard?VANCE: Well, you know, this is an effort by the president to walk this tightrope that he's been walking between compliance with the courts while, at the same time, bashing the federal judiciary. And so this notion that a judge is a rogue judge just because that judge rules against you should be a nonstarter for anyone who's an elected official in a position of authority, but certainly for the president of the United States. In this country, we submit our most difficult sorts of problems - problems we can't resolve on our own - to the courts for a ruling on what's legal and what isn't. And then the expectation is that we will follow those rulings. That's the commitment we all make to become part of this democracy, and this president has abandoned it.GROSS: So Trump is kind of challenging the separation of powers, and I'm wondering if you think that's going to have a long-term effect after he leaves office.VANCE: You know, Trump is setting precedent in his behavior, and the Supreme Court is setting precedent in case law. Ever since the conclusion of the Nixon presidency in Watergate, there have been people who have believed that the presidency - the power ascribed to the presidency - was suffering and that the Congress had taken on too much power and the courts had taken on too much power. And over time, this came to be called the unitary executive theory, the notion that the presidency needed to become more muscular. That used to be sort of a fringe theory on the far right of the conservative movement. But it's come into increasing prominence with Donald Trump, who, of course, has been, I think, more than willing to grasp any sort of power that the presidency can obtain. And so we've seen him push the limits and see just how much power he can get away with assuming for the presidency.At the same time, there are, you know, probably five justices on the Supreme Court who are willing to go along with the unitary executive theory to at least some extent. What we're observing now is the answer to the question, well, just how far are they willing to go with the unitary executive theory and the idea that this will survive beyond this presidency and become really a new normal, where the president will have far more ability to make inroads into powers we've traditionally ascribed to Congress? For instance, at risk right now - Congress' power of the purse as the president tries to withhold spending or Congress' power to declare war as the president tries to do it on his own using emergency powers. This is a fundamental reset of the balance of power among the three branches of government.GROSS: But in the use of, like, the unitary executive theory, I've been wondering. Like, back when the Constitution said that the president has executive power, what did executive mean back then? Like, you know...VANCE: So it's a great...GROSS: ...Meanings change over time.VANCE: Yeah. It's a great question because obviously, so much of our government is transformative. We don't have to look any further than the Second Amendment, where, at the time the founders created that right to bear arms, they were talking about muskets. And now we live in a world with far more powerful weapons, and we try to look backwards and give the language in the Constitution meaning in the modern context.So the executive branch obviously has a much more far-reaching mission and purpose than it had at the time of the founding. We have a sprawling executive branch that includes a number of administrative agencies. And much of the back-and-forth over the power that the president can exercise as an executive has to do with that sprawling administrative branch, where many agencies have been created by Congress or have grown up to be either quasi-independent or to operate based on the expertise of people who are true experts - scientists and others - in their fields of endeavor.Now, increasingly, there's a question of whether the president can fire those people at will and just how much ability the executive - the president and his cabinet secretaries - have to determine the course of those executive branch agencies. We're seeing a lot of that going on with HHS and the rescission of reliance on vaccines, for instance. So it's a modern-day controversy that goes back to the founding of the country in that sense.GROSS: Last week, several members of Congress made a video of each of them addressing members of the military, basically saying, you can refuse illegal orders. And they basically advised them that they should do that. And Trump, in response on social media, posted, seditious behavior from traitors. Lock them up. Lock them up - with three exclamation points after each, lock them up. Then there was another post where he wrote, seditious behavior, punishable by death.VANCE: This was an extraordinary move by the president, and I don't mean extraordinary in a positive sense. Look, these members of Congress, who were all former members of the military or the intelligence community, were in essence saying to their colleagues - they were reminding them of a very noncontroversial proposition, which is that you don't have to follow an illegal order. In fact, you have an obligation not to follow one. And there are established mechanisms for those public servants to challenge orders or to inquire into their legality through their chains of command. So nothing that these members of Congress were suggesting was in the least seditious.And for the president to make that implication forces you to confront the question, is this a president who believes that any order he gives is per se legal? For instance, there are questions developing about these strikes in international waters. There are questions about deployment of the National Guard in American cities. It's important for these public servants to have recourse to their chains of command and to their legal advice in this enormously unusual, difficult situation. To suggest that they shouldn't have that really runs contrary to our traditions and our laws.GROSS: I want to interrupt here with a brief update. After we recorded our interview yesterday morning, the Pentagon announced it's investigating Arizona senator and retired U.S. Navy captain Mark Kelly, who is one of the Democratic lawmakers in the video we're discussing, calling on members of the military not to obey illegal orders. We'll hear more of my interview with Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney, author of \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual For Keeping A Democracy,\" after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Joyce Vance. Her new book is about threats to our democracy and what individuals can do to protect and preserve it. It's titled \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable.\"There are things President Trump has said that have really posed a direct threat to judges or prosecutors who have challenged him as we've been discussing. And I don't know if you were married yet when your husband's father, who was a judge, was murdered by a mail bomb. So your family is very familiar with threats against judges, and I assume your husband might have had his own threats. And you, as a former federal prosecutor and now legal analyst on television, I'm sure you've had your share, as well. So can you tell us what happened with your father-in-law, why he was mail bombed?VANCE: Yeah, sure. So we were newly married. We were pregnant with our first child. And the bomb actually came to our home - to my in-laws' home at the time - disguised as a box from one of the judges on my father-in-law's court with whom he was friendly and had repeatedly shared packages back and forth, nothing really to cause alarm.My husband and I were out of town. My father-in-law opened the package sitting across the table from my mother-in-law. He was killed instantly, and she was injured very seriously. By the time we got home, she was in surgery, which fortunately saved her life, and we were able to continue to live together for many years. You know, the reality is that that situation was a tragedy. It involved a dissatisfied litigant with a history of using bombs that had harmed people.The difference between that situation and what federal judges are facing today is that today the threat is coming from inside of the house. It's coming from the presidency. And I think back to our experience and the notion that that package came to the house and could have been a threat to anyone in the household who touched it. You know, that's what all of these federal judges are living with now. To a certain extent, as a public servant, you assume the risk for yourself. But your spouse, your children, your parents - the notion that we're putting public servants' families at risk is something that's still very shocking to me.GROSS: So in your book about what people can do to preserve democracy in the U.S., you quote Alexander Hamilton, who said, the judiciary is beyond comparison as the weakest of the three departments of power. Why did Hamilton say the judiciary is the weakest? And do you think it still is? Do you think what Hamilton said stands up now?VANCE: It really does in this sense - the power that the judiciary possesses is dependent upon the public's confidence in the objectivity of the judiciary, in our willingness to go along with decisions that we may disagree with, even decisions that may be adverse to our personal interest, because we believe that the courts are there as a neutral arbiter of problems that people can't resolve among themselves. The courts don't have an army that goes out and enforces their decision. The Supreme Court declares what the law of the land is, and then it expects compliance. And so that's the core of Hamilton's commentary in that regard.It's a remarkable system, this democracy of ours, where people are allegiant to the rule of law and follow the precepts and the laws because we understand that that's essential for us to be able to live together. There's always some form of discontent with the legal system. And to be honest, that system is not perfect. We've all experienced, for instance, the racial injustice that can permeate it. So in many ways, it's an aspirational system that requires our constant attention and improvement to ensure that it works better and is fair and efficient for the entirety of our population.But now we have a president who objects to that system because it doesn't deliver the results that he wants. And that points out both the weakness and the strength of the system. It's weak in the sense that a powerful person can try to erode it. It's strong in the sense that the other branches of government can rightsize when one branch gets out of control, and a public focus and a focus in the media on the importance of the judiciary serves to shore it up and strengthen it.GROSS: Well, now we have a president who is assuming as much power as he possibly can. We have Republicans in Congress mostly following the president's wishes, and we have a Supreme Court that is a supermajority of Republicans, made a supermajority by Trump's appointments. I don't want to imply that all Republicans follow him or that the Supreme Court is fixed in some way. Nevertheless, he exerts enormous influence on, you know, the Supreme Court and Congress. So do you see that as being out of balance in terms of the division of branches of government?VANCE: Every federal judge who takes the bench gets there because a president from one party or the other appointed him or her, so that's the mechanism by which they all get there. But judges are remarkably independent individuals. They have their own view of the law and the fact. They consume the briefs and the arguments that are made by litigants before then, and remarkably, they do deliver opinions that carry the country forward.But I think it would be just sort of ignoring what we all know to be true to ignore the fact that this Supreme Court has tended to weigh in heavily for the president in surprising ways. For instance, in the immunity case, where the court went further than many analysts and observers believed it needed to in protecting a sitting president from criminal prosecution and all but derailing the January 6 prosecution, which ended up dying on the vine because Trump was reelected. So the court, when it decided the criminal immunity case, determined that prosecutors were not able to prosecute a sitting president.So the courts have played in, in many ways, to the power of this president. I think it's premature to suggest that they're completely coopted. For one thing, there are federal district judges across the country who remarkably, and despite the pressure and even the singling out that this president is prone to engage in of them when he doesn't like their decisions, these are folks who have stood up every day and tried to deliver decisions that abide by the dictates of the rule of law. We see that in the appellate courts as well. And in the Supreme Court, as we discussed earlier, there are a number of judges who ascribe to the unitary executive theory, who are willing to provide more muscular power to the presidency.We're about to get to the time where this court will have to decide where it sits on these issues. And there was one early inkling of where their red line in the sand might lie. And that happened in the deportation cases when it became clear that the administration, that the White House had defied an order issued by a federal judge, James Boasberg, in the District of Columbia saying that men who were migrants could not be transported to a prison in El Salvador, to El Salvadorian custody, without first receiving some small, modest measure of due process. And the Supreme Court permitted that decision to stand. So if you're the Supreme Court, if you want to remain relevant in modern America, the one place that you have to stand up is when it comes to whether or not you have the ability to review decisions made by the president.GROSS: So Judge Boasberg, who is the judge in question in the clip that we heard and who had ordered the deportation planes that the Trump administration had ordered to take off, the judge ordered the planes to turn around. And Trump did not fulfill that order. So Judge Boasberg recently said he plans to move ahead with looking at whether his orders were ignored, which could lead to contempt proceedings. Can you explain that?VANCE: The government objected to Judge Boasberg's efforts to raise contempt proceedings in this case. So the judge had entered an order that would've required the planes to turn around. In his view, the government's position, to the extent that we understand it from what they've publicly filed, was that the planes had somehow flown out of the jurisdiction of the United States before this order was entered, and that meant it didn't apply to them. I'm not sure if I'm doing full justice to the government's argument because it hasn't been fully fleshed out.But nonetheless, there's a new twist to this, which is a whistleblower who came forward and said that prosecutors were told by a high-ranking justice department official that it might be necessary to ignore court orders in order to effectuate the president's purpose. I'm not going to repeat the language that he allegedly used. So now there will be this proceeding where the ACLU lawyer who has been proceeding on behalf of the migrants, Lee Gelernt, will have the opportunity to present this new evidence in court. And Judge Boasberg will apparently hear testimony from live witnesses and make a determination about whether a criminal contempt referral to the Justice Department for certain individuals should be made.We're taping on Monday morning. Judge Boasberg indicated that he would issue guidance to the parties by the close of business on Monday indicating how he wanted to proceed with this contempt inquiry because he needs to engage in a fact-finding inquiry to determine what happened before he can make a decision about what he does next. So everything is in flux until the judge issues that guidance to the parties.GROSS: Let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Joyce Vance. And she has a new book, which is called \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual For Keeping A Democracy.\" She served as U.S. attorney for the northern district of Alabama during the Obama administration and is a longtime contributor, legal analyst for MSNBC, which is now MS NOW. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF FRED HERSCH'S \"A RIDDLE SONG\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Joyce Vance. Her new book is about threats to our democracy and what individuals can do to protect and preserve it. It's titled \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable.\" You may recognize Vance as a longtime legal analyst for MSNBC, which has been rebranded MS NOW. She also writes the Substack newsletter Civil Discourse and co-hosts the podcasts SistersInLaw and CAFE Insider. Vance spent 25 years as a federal prosecutor before President Obama appointed her as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. She held the position throughout his presidency and resigned the day before Trump's first inauguration.So before we get back to talking about the issues of the day, I want to talk a little bit about you and your experiences. You were appointed as a U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama by President Obama. So you were one of the first five U.S. attorneys that he nominated. And the first time you met Obama, what advice did he give you?VANCE: So during my time as the U.S. attorney in Birmingham, and all of my colleagues across the country - there are 93 U.S. attorneys at any one moment in time - we didn't have personal meetings with the president of the United States. He didn't call us up and ask us to bring or dismiss cases. When we met him, it was very formally, in groups, and we had an opportunity to meet with him in the White House during the second year of my tenure.And as you can imagine, President Obama was a very charismatic figure. He's a constitutional scholar, so someone who really resonates with a group of nerdy federal prosecutors. And when he walked into the room to meet with us, we were sort of standing very formally, and he spoke off the cuff and was funny and was pleasant. And then he turned serious. And he looked at us, and he said, I appointed you, but you don't work for me. You work for the American people, and I expect you to remember that. And that was a moment that stuck with all of us. It's something that we have discussed repeatedly among ourselves, how powerful that was as a charge to a group of federal prosecutors. You know, if the president gives you an order, you're going to execute it. Well, our order was to act with integrity, to serve our communities and to do justice. And that's something that I've always been singularly grateful I had the opportunity to participate in.GROSS: Do you think you would have acted that way without Obama's advice?VANCE: That's how prosecutors are hardwired to act. Really, it's a job that's about community service. That might seem a little bit funny because in many ways, the job is about putting criminals in prison. But really, if you're doing it properly, it's a job where you're thinking holistically about crime and community, and thinking as much about preventing crime as you are about prosecuting it if you're going to use your resources effectively. Having a boss, having a president who understood that and believed in that and encouraged it - that did nothing but give us the ability to go back to our communities and to act decisively and to do some really bold things that have, in many ways, become lost by what came after the Obama administration.But we had started on a trajectory to reform the criminal justice system so that we would, for instance, use data-driven best practices to prevent criminal recidivism, to tamp down on young people committing first crimes, to figure out better ways that custody could reform and rehabilitate people as opposed to simply warehousing them. You know, in so many ways, I regret that momentum that was lost as the fight to save democracy itself took predominance during the Trump administration. I hope that there will be a moment when we can get back to criminal justice reform, which is both necessary and powerful.GROSS: Is there a case you'd like to mention when you were a U.S. attorney that had the most lasting impact or that was most important to you?VANCE: That is such a hard call to make because, you know, you don't have the resources to do every case that's out there, and so prosecutors are constantly using their judgment to bring the cases that are the most impactful. But there is a case that stands out. And that's a case involving a law that was passed by the Alabama legislature - HB 56 - which the legislature described as a deport-yourself measure for people who are in the United States - noncitizens - without legal status.And one of those measures required schoolchildren to disclose their parents' immigration status to attend school. A lot of these kids were American citizens. And under a Supreme Court case called Plyler versus Doe, even if you're not an American citizen, you have a right to a kindergarten through grade 12 education in this country - a fundamental, basic human right to education. So by forcing students to disclose their parents' immigration status, in effect, Alabama had found a mechanism for destroying this right that young children should have.There is also a provision in the bill which would have criminalized a very common practice for religious people in Alabama of banding together in church organizations to provide transportation to people to receive medical care. And that was something that many of these very religious people were deeply committed to doing. Again, they thought it was something that was right. They didn't believe that their conduct should be criminalized. So we challenged 10 or 12 provisions like that in the bill and were largely successful in court. And again, this was an important case because it brought our community together. It helped us find, in the face of a very divisive issue, points of common agreement about our joint humanity and then a path forward through the problem.GROSS: I'm still thinking about how this bill would basically require children to turn in their parents or just stay home and not go to school at all.VANCE: You know, Alabama is a headcount state, which means that the way our education funding comes in is that there is an actual headcount that's made of the number of kids in school on a certain day, and funding is allocated. And the year that HB 56 went into effect, before our challenge was successful, Alabama lost school funding because so many kids weren't in school.And as we had the opportunity before we filed our legal challenge to speak with people in the community, we heard horrible stories from kids who were afraid that if they went to school, they would come home and one of their parents or both of their parents wouldn't be there. I had a conversation with a young man whose parents brought him to a community meeting. And he told me the story of how he could no longer go to the zoo with his uncle because his uncle wasn't an American citizen, although he was. And he was afraid that if they went to the zoo, his uncle would be taken away from him. You know, those are the sort of stories that live with you in memory for a very long time.GROSS: What we're seeing today with the emphasis on deportations - it seems like a very loud echo of the case you were just describing.VANCE: Sometimes in Alabama, we joke that we're 10 years ahead of the rest of the country, except that we don't mean that we're ahead. Often, when it comes to these sorts of plans, they're tried in places like Alabama first. That's been true with immigration. It's also been true in the area of suppressing voting rights. You know, the practical reality in Alabama was that that year, the tomato crop withered on the vine because there weren't people who were in place to pick those crops, and the construction industry suffered. And that's the practical reminder that when we assess immigration and talk about closing our borders, we're very often talking about harming our own economy. And so it's critical to have responsible leaders who, instead of these sort of knee-jerk, jingoistic policies, are willing to engage in hard thought and compromise on difficult issues like this.GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Joyce Vance, and her new book is called \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual For Keeping A Democracy.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S \"DERVISH\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Joyce Vance. Her new book is about threats to our democracy and what individuals can do to protect and preserve it. It's titled \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable.\"How surprised were you that the Supreme Court ruled that a president was basically above the law in any alleged crime if that alleged crime happened during a presidential action?VANCE: So I was very surprised. I've had to hock my crystal ball for predicting Supreme Court decisions because I don't think I'm very good at it, based on that case. You know, what it came down to for me was I didn't believe that the Supreme Court would rule that a president could order SEAL Team Six to execute a political rival. That was one of the hypotheticals that was aired during oral argument in that case. And yet a majority of the Supreme Court provided the president with full immunity for official acts. How that would have stood up if the prosecution had continued and the case had gone back to the Supreme Court is something that's not clear. It didn't happen.It seems to me that there's a bright line that the Supreme Court could still invoke between conduct committed by a president as president and conduct committed by a president as a candidate - right? - candidate Trump versus President Trump, which would, for instance, have permitted prosecution of events surrounding January 6. But we don't know how this court would have come out because that opportunity was foreclosed by the reelection of Donald Trump.GROSS: What would it take to overturn the Supreme Court decision that says - that basically says the president is above the law?VANCE: In large part, Supreme Court decisions are only infrequently reversed outright, although we've seen a lot of that in recent years, right? We've seen, for instance, Dobbs, the case that took away Roe versus Wade and women's abortion rights. You know, this is a relatively new case. Theoretically, it could be possible for the Supreme Court to say that they've decided to reverse it. But I think what's far more likely, if there is a challenge - and I don't want to pretend that there's a challenge on the horizon because, in essence, this case is very unlikely to be revisited unless there is a prosecution of a president, which is frankly not going to happen while this president controls the Justice Department. But let's theoretically say that there might be a future challenge.In that case, then we're back to that sort of a line-drawing exercise, and perhaps the Supreme Court might draw some limits based on the Founding Fathers' intention to create a government. You know, they created this government in reaction to the rule of kings. That's why this notion that no man is above the law, that we have no kings, is so powerful in our democracy. The Supreme Court might see fit to reinstitute that and to clarify that, although they intended to immunize core presidential functions from prosecution, that they were not speaking to, for instance, personal conduct by a president or certain kinds of behavior that would be perceived as blatantly criminal, like violent acts.GROSS: Trump has several personal lawyers in high-placed positions now in his administration. Pam Bondi, the director of the Justice Department, was a former personal lawyer. The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, former personal lawyer. And - who am I leaving out?VANCE: Emil Bove, who's now...GROSS: Yes.VANCE: ...A Third Circuit Judge.GROSS: So it strikes a lot of people as being very unethical to have your former personal attorney, who is obviously on your side, be the head of the Justice Department, who will be making rulings pertaining to you. So that seems like a conflict of interest. But is there anything official that would prohibit it?VANCE: Trump is a unicorn. He's the only sitting president who's had, for instance, a former impeachment lawyer - Pam Bondi - or a former criminal lawyer - Todd Blanche - who he can appoint. I think that we need to be clear that presidents appoint Justice Department officials who they believe are aligned with them and who will serve them. Not Justice Department officials, however, who will commence prosecutions in order to fulfill their desires for revenge or avoid prosecuting their enemies. And that's the line that's been drawn here. That's the fundamental corruption of the Justice Department, which at least since the end of Watergate has maintained this stoic separation from the White House.There's always been a communications or a contacts policy between the White House and the Justice Department that severely restricted the people between those two offices who can communicate to only the highest levels of government. And that's specifically done so that the White House can't exert influence over prosecutions or civil cases. That's the line that this White House has violated and the conflict that's created with the appointment of these people who are so closely aligned with the president that they serve him personally out of loyalty in many cases, rather than hewing to the oaths that they took to uphold the Constitution.GROSS: I want to play another clip. And this is a clip I think a lot of our listeners have already seen. It's from last week after the House and Senate approved release of the Epstein files. And now there are new investigations that will be under way based on those files. This is Pam Bondi last week at a press conference after the Epstein files were approved for release.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAM BONDI: We will continue to follow the law, again, while protecting victims, but also providing maximum transparency.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Quick follow-up to that. Madam Attorney General, the DOJ statement earlier this year saying that the files would not release mention the fact that the review of the documents and the evidence did not suggest that any additional investigation of third parties was warranted. What changed since then that you launched this investigation?BONDI: Information that has come. Information. There's information, new information, additional information. And again, we will continue to follow the law, to investigate any leads. If there are any victims, we encourage all victims to come forward. And we will continue to provide maximum transparency under the law.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: On Ryan Wedding, Madam General. On Ryan Wedding, you mentioned...UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Excuse me, excuse me.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Oh.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Madam Attorney, the issue with the new information that you just indicated. Is the department seeking information perhaps from the Epstein estate because Mr. Blanche did not have that information when he interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell? What new information? And would you limit the new investigation to just those named persons that the president talked about, or is this a broad, open-ended investigation?BONDI: I would refer to the deputy attorney general's post that he put out on X. And we're not going to say anything else on that because now it is a pending investigation in the Southern District of New York.GROSS: What was your reaction when you heard that?VANCE: For starters, this is clearly a pretextual investigation designed to give the Justice Department an excuse for not turning over the Epstein files, despite this new law that Congress has passed and the president has signed. It lets the president maintain the pretense that he's willing to turn over the files, leaving the Justice Department to do the dirty work, which they seem to be more than willing to do. The Epstein case was fully investigated in the Southern District of New York. They indicted Epstein.They indicted his coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, and they convicted her. She's currently serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison, although in greatly improved circumstances because after she met with the deputy attorney general, she was transferred in violation of Bureau of Prisons policy about how sex offenders are handled this early in service of their sentence - and is, according to media reports, leading a far more luxurious life than most inmates, treating prison personnel like a concierge service. So there's that aspect of this situation.Case has already been investigated and prosecuted. In July, Pam Bondi announced that she was closing it. And now she says four times the word information as though that's somehow a justification for reopening it, which clearly, it's not. There would have to be information that would indicate that there were people who were Epstein coconspirators or people who committed some other sorts of crimes who could be prosecuted. And instead, what we see is a request by the president that only people who are Democrats whose names appear in Epstein's communication be investigated, regardless of whether those communications provide some sort of a basis for believing that they were involved in criminal conduct.It's ironic that Donald Trump's name appears so preeminently in these communications. But he has of course excepted himself from any sort of investigation. So really, from multiple different sorts of ways you can look at this situation, it gives no appearance of legitimacy or credibility or of an effort to resolve the horrific abuse that the survivors endured at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and people that were involved with him.GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Joyce Vance. And her new book is called \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual For Keeping A Democracy.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF RANKY TANKY SONG, \"FREEDOM\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Joyce Vance. Her new book is about threats to our democracy and what individuals can do to protect and preserve it. It's titled \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable.\"The main point of your book is don't give up. Whatever it is you're capable of doing to preserve democracy, do that. But I want to bring up something you bring up in the book, which is the example of your youngest sonVANCE: Yeah.GROSS: And his disengagement from American politics. And you point out, when he was growing up, things were already eroding. He didn't lose what older people have lost, which is the assumption of democracy. Can you tell us more about that?VANCE: So in a series of conversations with my youngest son, who's 22, I came to understand a fundamental issue that we need to confront, which is this. My kid is young, well-educated, smart and he's a voter. He votes in every election. His friends vote in elections. What they seem to not have is this fundamental love for democracy that's so deeply ingrained in many of us - certainly in my generation and even younger people - and our understanding that democracy - you know, to paraphrase Winston Churchill - is maybe a bad form of government but better than everything else that's ever been tried, right? It's through democracy that we have the ability to influence outcomes because we elect our officials and they have to be responsive to us, at least in some measure, if they intend to hold onto their jobs.So the point that my son Olly (ph) made to me was that he was very young when the Occupy protests happened, but he remembered them. It was sort of his early touchstone. And nothing had changed. He said to me, Mom, you know, wealthy people, billionaires, still control Congress and the caucuses. And the idea that me and people like me in their 20s could stand up and combat that in a meaningful way, that's just silly, and it's wrong of you to try to impose that responsibility on us.It was a series of conversations that we had, and it forced me to take a step back and to realize that, especially for our youngest generation of voters, we need to take the time to make the case for democracy and to explain to them why it's meaningful and important not just to pick a candidate and vote for that candidate, but to constantly be thinking about reinvigorating democracy because that's how we accomplish our own goals and make our lives look the way we want them to.GROSS: Are you surprised that your son is thinking the way he's thinking about politics?VANCE: Well, you know, to be honest, with a 22-year-old - right? - you're never sure what's going on in their head. And I was very surprised by how strong his pushback was. In our first conversation, he was almost angry. You know, I was saying, don't you want to go out and protest with me? I mean, what do you want to do? Do you want to work on a campaign? And he was angry that I would impose the fix for a broken system on his generation, which took me a minute to accept. But I think in many ways, his response was a righteous one, as though it shouldn't be our effort to make his generation be responsible for something that we broke and failed to fix.We need to make as many steps as we can towards fixing this problem, while at the same time, there's this obligation, I think, to renew our idea about what civics education means. It shouldn't be something that happens only in the classroom. We need to make sure that folks have hands-on experience with democracy, that they understand that it's critical to vote, often in down-ballot elections, which can be more important for your daily life than even the national elections - who your mayor is, who's on your city council, who's on your school board. Those roles have profound influence on our lives. And so we have to live civics education and make it a part of our daily existence rather than something that we just do in the breach.GROSS: In your book, you make it clear you think our institutions will hold. The Supreme Court, Congress - what makes you think that? You've been so critical of moves made during the Trump administration, Trump One and Trump Two.VANCE: The architecture that the Founding Fathers created for our democracy is a sound and a sensible structure. And over the course of our history, it's demonstrated that it's nimble enough to survive serious challenges. So the institutions are nimble. It's up to us as voters to keep our eyes on them and who's populating them. And of course, we'll have the ability to do that in the midterm elections, which is our opportunity to begin to reestablish some guardrails.GROSS: Joyce Vance, thank you so much for coming on our show.VANCE: Thanks for having me.GROSS: Joyce Vance's new book is called \"Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual For Keeping A Democracy.\" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, our guest will be Michael Shannon.

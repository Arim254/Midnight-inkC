Alvarez/FR596 AP\n    \n\n   \n   TEL AVIV, Israel — U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday he's \"not happy\" with the latest talks over Iran's nuclear program but indicated he would give negotiators more time to reach a deal to avert another war in the Middle East.   He spoke a day after U.S. envoys held another inconclusive round of indirect talks with Iran in Geneva. As American forces gather in the region, Trump has threatened military action if Iran does not agree to a far-reaching deal on its nuclear program, while Iran insists it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes and denies seeking a nuclear weapon.   \n   \"I'm not happy with the fact that they're not willing to give us what we have to have. I'm not thrilled with that. We'll see what happens. We're talking later,\" Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday. \"We're not exactly happy with the way they're negotiating. They cannot have nuclear weapons.\"   Despite Trump's negative assessment, one of the mediators of the talks later Friday appeared to issue a public plea to let the negotiations continue. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been mediating the talks, said on CBS's Face the Nation that he felt a deal was within reach if the process could play out.   \"If I was President Trump, my only advice is just to give those negotiators enough room, enough space to really close these remaining areas that we need to discuss and agree upon,\" he said.   Trump sounded more pessimistic, telling reporters as he visited Texas on Friday that Iranian negotiators \"don't want to quite go far enough. It's too bad.\"   He reiterated that he did not want to see Iran allowed to enrich any amount of uranium and said the oil-rich nation should not need to enrich uranium for an energy program.   \n   When asked by a reporter how close he was to deciding on whether to launch a military strike, he said, \"I'd rather not tell you.\"   Earlier in the day, he was asked at the White House about the risks of the U.S. getting involved in a drawn-out conflict if it strikes Iran.   \"I guess you could say there's always a risk,\" Trump replied. \"You know, when there's war, there's a risk of anything, both good and bad.\"   Rubio heads to Israel   U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to make a quick trip to Israel early next week, the State Department said. The U.S. Embassy in Israel had earlier urged staff who want to leave to depart, joining other nations in encouraging people to leave the region and signaling that U.S. military action might be imminent.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People gather at a lookout to look for the possible arrival of the US Navy's aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford in the Mediterranean Sea near the coast of Haifa, northern Israel, Friday, Feb. 27, 2026.\n                \n                    Leo Correa/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Leo Correa/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The announcement of Rubio's visit and Trump's latest remarks could indicate a longer timeline for any potential strike.   The State Department said Rubio would visit Israel on Monday and Tuesday to \"discuss a range of regional priorities, including Iran, Lebanon, and ongoing efforts to implement President Trump's 20-Point Peace Plan for Gaza.\" It offered no other details.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long urged tougher U.S. action against Iran, and has warned that Israel will respond to any Iranian attack.   Before his trip, Rubio declared Iran to be a \"state sponsor of wrongful detention,\" and the State Department may invalidate U.S. passports for travel to Iran.   He said the move was due to the country's continued arrests and imprisonment of \"innocent Americans\" and citizens of other countries for use as political leverage. The move does not automatically carry any penalties, but Rubio said that if Iran doesn't stop, he could make it illegal to use a U.S. passport for travel to or from Iran. That restriction currently only applies to North Korea.   \n   A confidential report from the U.N. nuclear watchdog meanwhile confirmed that Iran has not offered inspectors access to sensitive nuclear sites since they were heavily bombed during the 12-day war launched by Israel last June. As a result, it said it could not confirm Iran's claims that it stopped uranium enrichment after the U.S. and Israeli strikes.   The report was circulated to member countries and seen by The Associated Press.   Those wishing to leave 'should do so TODAY'   The announcement of Rubio's visit came just hours after the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem implemented \"authorized departure\" status for nonessential personnel and family members, which means that eligible staffers can leave the country voluntarily at government expense.   In an email, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee urged staff considering departure to do so quickly, advising them to focus on getting any flight out of Israel and to then make their way to Washington.   \"Those wishing to take AD should do so TODAY,\" Huckabee wrote, using an acronym for \"authorized departure.\"   \"While there may be outbound flights over the coming days, there may not be,\" he added. The email was recounted to the AP by someone involved with the U.S. mission who wasn't authorized to share details.   On a town-hall meeting Friday after the email was sent, Huckabee told staff that he was encouraging airlines to keep flying.   Vance meets with mediator   Iran and the United States on Thursday walked away from another round of nuclear negotiations in Geneva without a deal. Technical discussions are scheduled to take place in Vienna next week.   Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday said \"what needs to happen has been clearly spelled out from our side,\" without offering specifics. Iran has long demanded relief from heavy international sanctions in return for taking steps to limit but not end its nuclear program.   \n   Before his interview on CBS News, al-Busaidi met Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance to discuss the negotiations.   \"I am grateful for their engagement and look forward to further and decisive progress in the coming days,\" al-Busaidi posted on X. \"Peace is within our reach.\"   In his interview after briefing Vance, al-Busaidi, said there had been significant breakthroughs in the talks, that Iran had expressed that it was willing to give up its enriched uranium, not accumulate more and allow for comprehensive outside inspections.   The White House, Vance's office and the Iranian mission to the U.N. did not immediately response to a request for comment.   Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, meanwhile met with Christopher Yeaw, a U.S. arms control official. Grossi posted on X that the two men had a \"timely exchange on current non-proliferation issues, including in Iran and other areas of common interest.\"   The U.N. chief urged Iran and the U.S. \"to focus on the diplomatic track.\"   \"We're seeing both positive messages coming out of the diplomatic tracks, which we're continuing to encourage,\" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said, according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.   \"We're also seeing very worrying military movements throughout the region, which is extremely concerning as well.\"   Flights suspended as people are urged to leave   The U.S. has gathered a massive fleet of aircraft and warships in the Middle East, with one aircraft carrier already in place and another heading to the region. Iran says it will respond to any U.S. attack by targeting American forces in the region, potentially including those stationed in U.S. bases in allied Arab countries.   Airlines such as Netherlands-based KLM have already announced plans to suspend flights out of Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport, and other embassies have also made plans for authorized departures from Israel and neighboring countries.   \n   Britain's Foreign Office said that \"due to the security situation, U.K. staff have been temporarily withdrawn from Iran.\" It said the embassy was operating remotely.   In Israel, the U.K. said Friday it moved some diplomatic staff and their families from Tel Aviv to another, unspecified location in Israel \"as a precautionary measure.\" In an update to its travel advice, the Foreign Office advises against \"all but essential travel\" to Israel.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday the U.K. was focused on \"supporting the political process\" between Washington and Tehran.   Germany's Foreign Ministry meanwhile advised urgently against travel to Israel.   Australia on Wednesday \"directed the departure of all dependents of Australian officials posted to Israel in response to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East.\" China, India and several European countries with missions in Iran have advised citizens to avoid travel to the country.   China's Foreign Ministry also advised its citizens already in Iran to leave, according to a statement reported by Chinese state media.\n",

Thom Tillis chose not to seek reelection following disagreements with President Trump.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Senator Thom Tillis is not running for reelection after several high-profile disagreements with President Trump. That leaves an open Senate seat in the purple state of North Carolina. Former two-term governor Roy Cooper is expected to coast to the Democratic nomination in Tuesday's primary elections. And on the Republican side, many primary voters are looking for who would best support the president in Washington. North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner reports.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Whenever he's not working with the cases...THOMAS D EDWARDS: Uh-huh.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ...He works as a fireman (ph).ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Thomas D. Edwards stops to hear everyone out as he heads in to cast his early vote. His polling place is at the Farm Credit Farmers Market in Wayne County, about an hour southeast of Raleigh. On his way out. Edwards does not say who he supports for the Senate, but he makes clear that Trump's backing factors into his thinking.EDWARDS: Remember, smart people do smart things. Stupid people do stupid things. And I don't look at Mr. Trump as being a stupid man.WAGNER: Many Republicans voting in this primary hold a similar view. They're looking for a candidate they know will support Trump, and Trump has made his choice clear. Last summer, he stepped into this race, endorsing then-Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley. In December, Whatley appeared with Trump in Rocky Mount.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL WHATLEY: I am going to be a fighter every day for this great state. I am going to be a conservative champion for North Carolina, and I am going to be an ally to our great president.WAGNER: Along with Trump's endorsement, Whatley holds a major lead in fundraising in the campaign. Still, he has several primary challengers who are trying to make the case that they've shown they are actually more likely to back Trump. Those include Don Brown and Michele Morrow. Brown is a former U.S. Navy JAG officer who has defended people charged in connection with the January 6 riots, and Morrow is a former state superintendent candidate who has previously called for the execution of several prominent Democrats.Republican voters interviewed by the North Carolina Newsroom at some polling places during early voting showed a clear preference in the race. James Huffman braved frigid temperatures to vote in Alamance County this week, about an hour northwest of Raleigh. He voted for Whatley.JAMES HUFFMAN: I'm just looking for stability - conservative stability - and someone who is winnable.WAGNER: Michael Bitzer, the chair of Catawba College's political science department, says for Whatley's campaign, quote, \"winnable\" means showing allegiance to the president.MICHAEL BITZER: It starts with Trump and it ends with Trump. And I think the loyalty that a lot of Trump Republicans, MAGA Republicans, want from members of Congress to the president is where Whatley sees the clear indication of winning the primary.WAGNER: That alignment with Trump could give Whatley the boost he needs in the primary, but Trump's approval ratings have started to falter in North Carolina, and Bitzer warns that might work against Whatley in November. Meanwhile, Cooper's attention is already turning towards that general election.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROY COOPER: I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I'm concerned about the cost that everyday families are feeling right now.WAGNER: North Carolina voters have sent Republicans to the U.S. Senate in every election since 2010. But Cooper is well known here. He's won six consecutive statewide elections. That means this Senate seat could be in play in November.

    "body": "\n      Democratic Rep. Wesley Bell of Missouri, a member of the House Oversight Committee, talks about the deposition of the Clintons in the Epstein probe, which continues Friday with the former president.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Congressman Wesley Bell, a Democrat from Missouri, is a member of that House panel, the Oversight Committee, which is expected to hear from former President Bill Clinton today. We actually reached him at a diner in New York in advance of the hearing. Good morning, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.WESLEY BELL: Hey. Good to be here, and I got my coffee at the diner so (laughter)...MARTIN: Excellent. Good to hear. So former first lady, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeatedly said she never met Jeffrey Epstein, but the former president obviously had. There are photographs of them together. The president's spokesperson acknowledges that Mr. Clinton took four international trips on Epstein's plane for the Clinton Foundation's charity works. He had a meeting with Epstein in New York, et cetera. So what do you think you might learn from him today?BELL: You know, I've - he released his declaration, and so I anticipate it will be similar to that, obviously, more detail. But, you know, what I've said is - and I've led these type of depositions before as a former prosecutor, what we're seeing is political theater. This is not a serious investigation by Republicans, and it's disappointing because there are real victims. There are real survivors who deserve justice and deserve us to do a full and transparent investigation, and that's just not what we're seeing.MARTIN: Is it possible that this sets a precedent that might allow for President Trump to be deposed regarding Mr. Epstein?BELL: I mean, the precedent has been set at this point. You know, if Republicans feel that it's necessary to depose the former president, which I'm not opposed to hearing information - any information that leads us or gets us closer to uncovering the truth. But then that also includes the current president, that includes the current first lady, that includes Howard Lutnick. It includes Elon Musk and a slew of others. I don't care what the letter is in front of your name, if there is information that will help an investigation so that we can bring justice to the survivors and victims, then that's what we need to do.MARTIN: It - just one more question on this question of sort of political theater. The fact is the FEC filings do show that Bill and Hillary Clinton both benefited from Epstein's political donations. Now, that was back in the 1990s. There are visitor logs that show that Epstein made 17 trips to the White House. That was in the Clinton administration, and the Clinton Foundation did receive a significant donation from Epstein's nonprofit. Now, that was 2006. Now, that was before he was convicted - that Mr. Epstein was convicted in connection with these sex trafficking charges, but it does indicate a relationship there. Is that not worthy of some discussion or investigation?BELL: Again, I am - been on the record publicly and privately. Anyone who has information, we want to hear from, and that includes the Clintons. So I don't have any issue with hearing them and deposing them. But what I'm seeing from this administration, from House Republicans, is that they want all the information from Democrats to smear Democrats, but they stop at Republicans. And then when I hear the talking points from Republicans that Donald Trump was exonerated when we have living survivors who are saying the opposite and publicly saying that, and we know that there are at least 50 pages of missing Epstein files that include Donald Trump, so they need to release all the files. They need to do a serious investigation because at the end of the day, Americans want to know, and victims and survivors deserve to know.MARTIN: So a couple of more questions about the - just the hearings themselves. Hillary Clinton said she wanted her testimony and Mr. Clinton's to be public. Can you offer any insight into why this was denied?BELL: It was denied because Republican - House Republicans denied it. They don't want to be transparent. They want to say that they're being transparent. They want to use it as a talking point, but the proof isn't right here in the pudding. Democrats have asked for these depositions to be public. The Clintons asked for these depositions to be public. The media was a hundred yards away outside. We could've easily just opened the door and let them in, but Republicans refused and then released pictures, released leaked comments and statements. It's ridiculous. It's not serious, and Republicans need to take this seriously because victims and survivors deserve it.MARTIN: Before we let you go, just very briefly, you mentioned that a right-wing influencer posted a photo online of Hillary Clinton, apparently taken by your Republican colleague Lauren Boebert during the closed deposition. That's a violation of House rules. Is there going to be a consequence for this?BELL: I think there should be. You know, I think there should be. I think that the rules were made by the Republicans. They decided to make these depositions closed, and then they violated the - their own rules.MARTIN: That is Democratic Congressman Wesley Bell of Missouri. He's a member of the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, thank you.BELL: My pleasure.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Republicans and Democrats are embracing their own takes on populism to respond to shifting politics in the country.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Democrats and Republicans traded visions for America this week, both in the State of the Union address and on the campaign trail. Both parties are embracing the core message that America's institutions are failing. But who each party blames and who they say can fix it cannot be more different. This antiestablishment thinking, known as populism, is dominating politics in the country in this moment. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and NPR political reporter Elena Moore join us now to talk about why. Hey to both of you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hello.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey there.CHANG: Hey. OK. So let's just start with the pretty basic question here. Democrats and Republicans proposed very different ideological agendas. So how is it that both parties are embracing populism at this moment?MONTANARO: Well, Ailsa, I mean, anger is really at the center of American politics right now. I mean, people are pessimistic about the direction of the country. They have a negative outlook on the economy and their position in it. And they're down on the overall political system, like you mentioned.And populism is about pitchforks. You know, who they're aimed at, though, is pretty different. You know, for the right, it's about immigrants and liberal elites and blaming them for the economic problems of blue-collar workers and the, quote, \"forgotten man and woman,\" which, of course, Trump ran on in 2016 and, you know, he did that again in the State of the Union address this week, taking aim at Somali immigrants in Minnesota for fraud cases in the state, saying that, quote, \"Americans pay the price.\" For the left, it's really about corporations and billionaires and oligarchs, as they see it, with access to power and influence.CHANG: Yeah. Let's talk more about that, Elena. Explain more about how all of that translates to a message for Democrats.MOORE: Well, there's no singular populist message on the Democratic side, and part of that is because the party doesn't have a leader, and part of that is because the party is still trying to just figure out what their broader national message looks like after losing in 2024. But, you know, we do know that this is the party's focus right now. And we have seen different rising voices in the party champion economic populist messages and really tailor them to different communities in different ways. And I think one high-profile example is James Talarico. He's a Democrat running for Senate in Texas, and primary day for that race is next week, by the way. Here's how Talarico made his pitch to voters in a recent ad that ran during the Super Bowl.(SOUNDBITE OF AD)JAMES TALARICO: Billionaires don't just influence politicians - they own them. That's why I don't take corporate PAC money. It's why I fought to cap campaign contributions. In the Senate, I'll ban billionaires from making unlimited secret donations.MOORE: So Democrats are really trying to mainstreamify that type of populist message, and I mean, it doesn't get more mainstream than the Super Bowl.CHANG: I guess not. OK. Let's go back to Republicans. Domenico, what is the Republican version of this populist message?MONTANARO: You know, this all goes back to the Tea Party movement, which came in response to what it felt like was a liberal direction that they couldn't stomach, a feeling that taxes and spending were too high as major demographic change was happening and happened to be during the presidency of the first Black president. Some of that frankly had a degree of racism attached to it. You know, Trump tried to other former President Barack Obama, pushing the racist birther theory, the false idea that he wasn't born in the United States. All the while, the, quote-unquote, \"replacement theory,\" this idea that immigrants were going to change the values and the literal complexion of the country, something that started with white nationalists and white supremacists - that was taking hold within the Republican Party, and now there's the targeting of trans rights. And it's all related because the glue for the right-wing populism that we're seeing is culture and how their preferred culture is changing or being threatened.CHANG: Well, yeah, like, let me ask you, Elena, because former President Biden was elected on this vision of restoring America to the way politics has operated for decades. And you focus on young voters in your reporting. It feels like to me that young voters do not want to see things stay the same way they have been for decades, right?MOORE: Yeah. I mean, it's worth mentioning that by 2028, Gen Z and millennials are going to make up more than half of all eligible voters in this country, and young people are just increasingly distrustful of the political system. And there's reasons behind that. They've come of age during a time where government hasn't worked for them. Many struggle with student debt or feel like high prices bar them from things like buying a house or starting a family - these economic concerns that they feel Democrats promise to address and haven't. So when candidates are running on, like, an anti-status quo, affordability-focused message, I think it appeals to a lot of young people who feel, like, frankly, fed up with the politics of the past. And I think that's why you're seeing so many younger and just progressive candidates rejecting campaign dollars from corporations and special interest groups because I think they see it as part of that broader issue set.CHANG: But Domenico, I mean, we've talked often about how Democrats are not exactly unified on how to resolve issues in this country, even when they do agree on what the problems are. So how does this kind of message work for Democrats?MONTANARO: Yeah. It's a challenge for them. And one they're probably going to have to contend with more in 2028 because midterms are so much more about the party in power and a referendum on the president. But this is eventually going to be a real issue for Democrats to contend with. You know, the left often urgently demands results that aren't always easily achievable. And for a lot of Democratic operatives, this idea of not taking corporate money when the other side is happy to flood the system is like fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. You know, so all of this, you know, creates more antipathy, though, among the key voting groups within the Democratic Party, and it's why polls have shown the left down on the Democratic Party itself.CHANG: Well, how do they resolve challenges like that?MOORE: Well, we don't exactly know for sure how this is going to play out, but I think there just may not be one sole populist playbook for Democrats. There may be a shared broader message. I mean, take New York leaders like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Mayor Zohran Mamdani. These are people with roots in Democratic socialism, and they've become national figures talking about economic inequality and affordability. But then, you know, that same focus has had broad parallels throughout the party. I mean, look at Virginia governor Abigail Spanberger. She ran last year as more of a centrist, but, you know, she made economic concerns the key part of her platform.CHANG: That is NPR's Elena Moore and Domenico Montanaro. Thank you to both of you.MONTANARO: You're welcome.MOORE: Thanks, Ailsa.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      In an effort to stabilize child care in America, the Biden administration changed how child care subsidies are paid. The Trump administration says the change invited fraud and is preparing a reversal.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Across the country, many child care providers are barely staying afloat. As essential as they are, their industry operates on tiny profit margins. And now the Trump administration is rolling back policies aimed at providing stability. The rationale is the prevention of fraud. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports.ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Michelle Wright runs two child care centers in Southwestern Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.MICHELLE WRIGHT: You OK?(SOUNDBITE OF COUGHING)HSU: This time of year, bad weather and illnesses can take a toll.WRIGHT: It's wintertime. It's Midwest.HSU: Attendance sometimes drops below 70%, which is a problem for Wright, and here's why. Ninety percent of the families she serves qualify for child care subsidies, which the state pays out based on attendance. So when a lot of kids are absent, she may not get paid what she was expecting. She has to scramble to figure out if she'll be able to pay her teachers.WRIGHT: That staff comes ready to work. Maybe spent gas, maybe took a Uber or a bus to get here. And then six kids are out, and I know the numbers are down. I have to send their staff home.HSU: It's a unique challenge for those like Wright, who want to serve low-income communities.WRIGHT: I chose the area because of the need.HSU: Things would be easier if she had opened her centers in more affluent areas. Families who pay for care themselves typically pay up front, and they're on the hook for the tuition, whether their children come in or not. Subsidy payments here in Illinois and many other states go out after the care has been provided and based on who shows up, allowing for some number of absences. Wright says, this is one reason there's not a lot of high-quality child care in low-income areas. It doesn't make business sense.WRIGHT: Most people won't take 90% subsidy.HSU: This issue came to a head during COVID, when many children were out for days. To keep day cares open, more states began paying based on who was enrolled, not who showed up. Turned out to be a game changer for many day cares, giving them predictability. Later, the Biden administration issued a rule mandating all states make this change and pay the subsidies upfront, like private-paying families do. Dozens of states got waivers, giving them more time to comply, but now the rule is getting scrapped altogether.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM O'NEILL: Hello, I'm HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill.HSU: This is a video posted by the Department of Health and Human Services in January. O'Neill, who has since left HHS, says requiring states to pay for care up front and based on enrollment created vulnerabilities.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O'NEILL: Those policies weakened accountability and made fraud easier, not harder.HSU: This announcement came shortly after allegations of child care fraud erupted in Minnesota. Such fraud is rare, but it does happen. In the past, providers have been found guilty of claiming subsidies for children who weren't in their care. States have moved to safeguard their systems with more oversight, more unannounced visits by state inspectors. Still, child care advocates worry the Trump administration's focus on fraud could get in the way of progress.DENISE WIESE: Ready?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Get it.WIESE: One, two, three.UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: [inaudible].HSU: At Lemay Child and Family Center in St. Louis County, Missouri, Denise Wiese, the center's executive director, has been looking forward to changes in how subsidies are paid. Last year, Missouri's Republican legislature approved making payments up front based on who's enrolled, not on who shows up. Beta testing has been underway, and...WIESE: We're hoping by mid-year, that will be throughout the state.HSU: But late last year, the state announced it needed more time to ensure the new system works correctly and to secure long-term funding because it will be more expensive. Whether the changes happen or not, Wiese is pushing for more investment, sustained investment in child care.WIESE: We have to take care of the children in our communities. They're the ones that are going to lead this country and lead the state 30 years from now.HSU: She says the country can't have a stable future without stable child care, Andrea Hsu, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Helena Bottemiller Evich, founder and editor in chief of Food Fix, about tensions between the MAHA movement and President Trump over glyphosate.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Make America Healthy Again supporters are angry, and it's putting Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a tough spot between his boss and his fans. And here's why. Last week, President Trump issued an executive order to increase domestic production of glyphosate, which is commonly used as a weed killer. You might know it by the brand name Roundup.And it immediately ignited an uproar in the MAHA movement. Kennedy and his base have long believed glyphosate is a health risk, but now Kennedy says he supports Trump's order. So is this the beginning of a fallout between Trump and some members of his base? To help us unpack this, we're joined now by Helena Bottemiller Evich. She's founder and editor-in-chief of the Food Fix newsletter. Welcome to the program.HELENA BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Thanks for having me.SUMMERS: OK, so just for starters, is this a fallout, a strain in the relationship? Or how would you describe what is happening right now between MAHA and Trump?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So I don't yet see this as a full-blown divorce, but we are definitely seeing a marital spat, and it's all happening in the public.SUMMERS: OK, so glyphosate, which is an active ingredient in Roundup, as we mentioned, is at the center of this very sort of public, messy spat. Why is it such a cornerstone to the MAHA agenda?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So I think MAHA at its core is really a concern about chronic disease, and there's a lot of different ways that people plug into this. Some of the MAHA moms that you'll hear about are concerned about vaccines. Some of them are concerned about environmental toxins. They're concerned about microplastics.Pesticides is one of those kind of core concerns, and that's where glyphosate falls into this. It's the most commonly used herbicide in the U.S., and a lot of MAHA moms want to see it dramatically reduced or even banned. And that has set up this conflict. We have an administration that is decidedly more deregulatory. They want to be more industry friendly. And this is really a big point of conflict.SUMMERS: And as I understand it, the science on glyphosate is pretty complicated. There's strong evidence for an association between the chemical and diseases like lymphoma and Parkinson's, but the level of exposure matters a lot, is that right?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So there is a really active debate in this space. The EPA has ruled that glyphosate is not likely to be a carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is more commonly known as IARC - that's part of the World Health Organization - they ruled that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic. That was mainly looking at animal studies.One of the key studies that everyone has long pointed to to sort of back up the safety of glyphosate, however, was recently retracted, and that has thrown up this red flag and I think really fueled even more MAHA concern that there are reasons to think that glyphosate might be contributing to cancer. Juries in the U.S. have awarded billions of dollars to individuals who believe their cancer cases were caused by glyphosate. And Bayer, which makes glyphosate, is now under tremendous pressure in the courts.SUMMERS: Back in 2018, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. won a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the maker of Roundup, arguing that the weed killer likely caused his client's cancer. So why do you think it is that he is now moving to fall in line with President Trump's plan to produce more of it in the United States?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So what Kennedy has said publicly is that he personally believes that glyphosate does cause cancer. That is not the Trump administration's official position, to be very clear. He has backed the president's executive order here, basically saying, look, the U.S. agricultural system currently relies on this, and we can't just walk away from it. It would be disastrous. He backs up the idea that we need to produce more domestically for national security reasons.SUMMERS: I know that you have been spending some time reading and hearing from members of this group. Based on what you know and what you've learned, how do you think this might end?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: I really don't know where all of this is headed, but I think the big central question at the heart of all of this is whether a deregulatory, sort of traditional Republican stance can square with what the MAHA movement fundamentally is asking for, which is a crackdown on toxins in the environment, toxins in the food supply. And they are hoping that at the end of the day, Kennedy and the noise that they make on the outside can maybe shift the Trump administration in their direction. I don't know that that will work, but that is what they are hoping for.SUMMERS: Helena Bottemiller Evich is founder and editor-in-chief of the Food Fix newsletter. Thank you.BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Thanks so much.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The closed-door deposition ended after more than six hours of questioning from lawmakers who said he answered every question posed to him.   The deposition in the Clintons' hometown of Chappaqua, New York, marked the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress. It came a day after Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sat with lawmakers for her own deposition.   \n   Bill Clinton has also not been accused of any wrongdoing, and Republican members of the House Oversight Committee did not immediately level any accusations against the Clintons as they departed Chappaqua. They planned to review the depositions but said their attention was mostly shifting to other individuals.   Lawmakers are grappling with what accountability in the United States looks like at a time when men around the world have been toppled from their high-powered posts for maintaining their connections with Epstein after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.   \n   \"We have questions about anyone who spent time with Epstein post-conviction,\" said Republican Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee. \"Once you knew Jeffrey Epstein was a sex offender, why did you continue a relationship?\"   Bill Clinton, in his opening statement, said that he had long stopped associating with Epstein by the time of his 2008 guilty plea. He also said it would be difficult to recall the specifics of events from more than 20 years ago, but expressed certainty that he had not witnessed signs of Epstein's abuse.   Republican Rep. John McGuire accused Bill Clinton of having \"selective memory\" during the questioning, but other GOP members departed acknowledging that he had handled the deposition with skill and candor. Comer called Bill Clinton \"charming\" during the questioning.   \n   \"Clinton was quite candid, perhaps more candid than his attorneys were comfortable,\" said Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy.   Republicans finally get a chance to question Bill Clinton   Republicans have wanted to question Bill Clinton about Epstein for years, especially as conspiracy theories arose following Epstein's 2019 suicide in a New York jail cell while he faced sex trafficking charges.   Those calls reached a fever pitch late last year when several photos of the former president surfaced in the Department of Justice's first release of case files on Epstein and Maxwell, a British socialite who was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 but maintains she's innocent. Bill Clinton was photographed on a plane seated alongside a woman, whose face is redacted, with his arm around her. Another photo showed Clinton and Maxwell in a pool with another person whose face was redacted.   Epstein also visited the White House several times during Clinton's presidency, and the pair later made several international trips together for their humanitarian work. Comer claimed the committee has collected evidence that Epstein visited the White House 17 times and that Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's airplane 27 times.   Democratic lawmakers said they also posed tough questions to Bill Clinton about his relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.   \"We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long,\" Bill Clinton said in his opening statement. \"And by the time it came to light with his 2008 guilty plea, I had long stopped associating with him.\"   Bill Clinton also went after Comer for calling his wife before the committee, telling him that \"including her was simply not right.\"   Comer said the committee was working to quickly publish a transcript and video recording of both days of depositions.   Has a precedent been set?   Democrats, who have supported the push to get answers from Bill Clinton, are arguing that it sets a precedent that should also apply to President Donald Trump, a Republican who had his own relationship with Epstein.   \n   \"I think that President Trump needs to man up, get in front of this committee and answer the questions and stop calling this investigation a hoax,\" said Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, on Friday.   Comer has pushed back on that idea, saying that Trump has answered questions on Epstein from the press. Republicans also said they have not come across any evidence that Trump did anything wrong in his relationship with Epstein.   Trump on Friday expressed remorse at Bill Clinton being forced to testify. \"I like Bill Clinton, and I don't like seeing him deposed,\" he told reporters as he departed the White House en route to Corpus Christi, Texas.   Democrats are also calling for the resignation of Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Lutnick was a longtime neighbor of Epstein in New York City but said on a podcast that he severed ties with Epstein following a 2005 tour of Epstein's home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.   The public release of case files showed that Lutnick actually had two engagements with Epstein years later. He attended a 2011 event at Epstein's home, and in 2012 his family had lunch with Epstein on his private island.   \"He should be removed from office and, at a minimum, should come before the committee,\" Garcia said of Lutnick.   Republican Rep. Nancy Mace questioned Hillary Clinton about Lutnick's relationship to Epstein during the deposition on Thursday. On Friday morning, Mace joined in calling for the commerce secretary to come before the committee.   \"I believe we will have the votes to subpoena him,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna said.\n",

DURHAM, N.C. — Voters in North Carolina head to the polls Tuesday for one of this year's first statewide primaries.   Since President Trump's election in 2024, when Democratic primary voters have chosen the type of candidate they want to represent them in the second half of Trump's term, there have been a handful of upset victories.   \n   A similar contest is playing out between an incumbent and a challenger with more progressive views in North Carolina's fourth congressional district. Democratic voters in the Raleigh-Durham area district will choose between incumbent Rep. Valerie Foushee or Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam.   Foushee is seeking her third term, but Allam is backed by Vermont's independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and several other national groups who want to replace Foushee with a younger, more outspoken leader who's further to the left. Allam says Democrats need to take stronger positions opposing immigration enforcement and Israel's war in Gaza.   \n   The race has attracted spending from outside PACs and donors across the country seeking to shape the Democratic caucus in Congress. The March 3 primary comes weeks after a similar special election primary in New Jersey, where activist Analilia Mejia won an upset over former Rep. Tom Malinowski for an open seat.   \n   Both Mejia and Allam worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns, and they have the support of the Sanders-aligned Justice Democrats group in their primaries. Sanders joined Allam recently at a rally in Durham.   \"Nida is a proven fighter with the courage to take on corporate power, to take on billionaires, to take on billionaire-funded Super PACs like crypto and AIPAC and all of these special interest groups who think they can buy American democracy,\" Sanders said at the event.   Like Mejia, Allam's campaign is benefitting from outside ad spending. But unlike Mejia, Allam is facing a two-term incumbent endorsed by dozens of Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Josh Stein.   An Allam victory could signal an even bigger shift in the Democratic primary electorate this year — a strong sign of discontent with the party's current leaders in Congress.   After attending the Sanders rally in Durham, Kyle Barber said Allam's campaign has gotten him energized about politics.   \n   \"It's been so long since I've been this excited to vote,\" he said. \"I have not been this excited to vote since 2020, and that was just because it was my first year I could vote. I am so tired of voting for the lesser of two evils.\"   But many Democrats don't have a problem with Foushee's record and are hesitant to switch leaders in Congress. \"I like Nida, personally,\" said Melissa McCullough. \"But Valerie Foushee has credibility amongst her peers, good committee assignments … and she brings home federal dollars. Now is not the time to send in someone who has to start from scratch.\"   \n   The fourth district tilts heavily to the left, so whoever wins the primary is virtually guaranteed a win in November.   Allam argues that Foushee has not been forceful enough in opposing the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions in North Carolina, Minnesota and elsewhere. When ICE and Border Patrol agents came to the state in November, Allam was among the protesters who filmed and shouted at them.   Foushee says she's sponsored and supported legislation to hold ICE accountable for what she calls a \"profound abuse of power.\" Allam wants to abolish ICE entirely, while Foushee wants to defund the agency and push for major reforms to federal immigration enforcement.   Outside money seeks influence   Gaza is also a major issue in the race. Allam is North Carolina's first Muslim woman elected official, and she says Foushee has been too supportive of Israel. The congresswoman has taken trips to Israel funded by the bipartisan lobbying group AIPAC, and the pro-Israel group donated to her past campaigns. But last year Foushee said she won't be taking any of their contributions this time around.   Last August, Foushee co-sponsored the \"Block the Bombs Act\" that would ban the sale of offensive weapons to Israel.   \n   Meanwhile, a new PAC called \"American Priorities\" has put more than $500,000 into the race so far in support of Allam. American Priorities said in a news release that this is the first of a dozen or so primaries where it's getting involved, and one of its key issues is reducing military aid to Israel. Another Allam backer is Leaders We Deserve, a group led by gun control advocate David Hogg. It has spent more than $270,000 on pro-Allam advertising.   \n   The massive data centers needed to power AI have also become a controversy in the race, as it has across the country. Allam is calling for a national moratorium on building new ones. Foushee has said she thinks the decisions are best left to local leaders in communities where data centers are proposed.    A new group connected to the artificial intelligence company Anthropic is putting more than a million dollars behind Foushee. She co-chairs a committee on AI for House Democrats.   Endorsements could also play a role in the outcome. Dozens of North Carolina elected Democrats have lined up to endorse Foushee, including Gov. Josh Stein and former Gov. Roy Cooper, as well as the state's other Democrats in Congress and the leaders of the Democratic caucuses in the legislature.   Establishment figures like Cooper are likely looking ahead to the general election, when Republicans would likely try to tie Allam to Cooper's U.S. Senate campaign if she wins the primary.\n",

The decision to impose new restrictions would be up to local housing authorities and private property owners who rent to people using a housing voucher, known as Section 8. Time limits could be as short as two years, and work requirements up to 40 hours a week. Those who are elderly or disabled – a majority of people with federal rental subsidies – would be exempt.   \n   President Trump proposed a two-year limit in his White House budget last year, along with slashing rental aid by 40%, but Congress rejected that. This rule would bypass Congress, assuming it's finalized.   Housing Secretary Scott Turner has said repeatedly that he wants to help tenants get off federal aid and promote self-sufficiency. Last year, he and three other Cabinet members wrote a New York Times opinion piece calling on Congress to expand work requirements across safety net programs. They said an increasing share of public benefits are not going to the \"truly needy,\" but to able-bodied adults who don't work.   Some 9 million people in the U.S. get federal housing assistance, and the cost of rent is unaffordable for large numbers of Americans.    \n   \"This proposal is based on false and harmful stereotypes, rather than concrete data or best practices,\" Deborah Thrope, deputy director at the National Housing Law Project, said in a statement. \"It ignores the fact that most participants in federal housing programs who can work, do in fact work. Saving enough to move off of assistance takes a long time and a lot of support.\"   The case for time limits on housing subsidies   Rental assistance is not an entitlement, and demand far outstrips the funds available. For the lucky minority who do get a housing voucher or a spot in public housing, often after waiting for years, they can keep it as long as needed. Supporters say time limits could help spread limited rental aid among more people.   \n   \"There's a whole lot of people who qualify for this kind of aid who don't receive it. So there's an inefficient use of our housing, because people can stay so long,\" said Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.   He said time limits could also encourage upward mobility, but should be not be imposed \"in a vacuum.\" To be effective, Husock said, a time limit should include a fixed rent and automatic savings accounts, so people can get ahead as their income rises.   Delaware State Housing Authority is one agency that's had success with such a program. Its time limit is 5-7 years, but can stretch longer in some cases.   The track record for time limits is mixed   Nationwide there are about 3,300 local public agencies that provide federally subsidized housing. Only about 140 of them currently have the flexibility to try things like time limits and work requirements, and only a few dozen have done so.   \n   \"I just don't necessarily think that a hard term limit has generated the sort of outcomes that people are looking for,\" Joshua Meehan told NPR last year. He advocates for these agencies as president of the Moving to Work Collaborative.   The group includes Keene Housing in New Hampshire, which Meehan now leads. It used to have a 5-year time limit but dropped it. As the deadline to end people's assistance approached it was clear their incomes had not increased by much.   \"I think it's fair to assume they would have wound up back on our waiting lists,\" he said.   Given that track record, it's not clear whether a significant number of housing authorities would choose to adopt the new restrictions. Forcing millions of people to give up their subsidy every few years could also rattle the private landlords who lease to those with a housing voucher.   \n   The proposed rule is scheduled to be published Monday, and will be open 60-days for public comment.\n",

Two years ago, Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama accepted what is often called the worst assignment in politics — rebutting the president's State of the Union address.   The televised response, broadcast live from Britt's tidy kitchen in Montgomery, was the Alabama freshman's introduction to a national audience, and what many viewers saw was an over-the-top firebrand, parodied as a \"scary mom\" by actress Scarlett Johansson on Saturday Night Live.   \"The American dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families,\" Britt said in the speech.   \n   Standing in as her party's pick to rebut the president, ahead of his reelection bid no less, is a daunting task for any up-and-coming politician, but even some Republicans described Britt's performance with words like baffling and bizarre.   Colleagues say this initial caricature of Britt as a hyper-partisan MAGA mom is simply untrue. In the Senate, Britt has been building a different reputation — as a bipartisan dealmaker.   Now Britt is helping negotiate changes to how immigration agents operate after the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis as Democrats refuse to fund the Department of Homeland Security without reforms. The department has now been shut down for more than 10 days.   And at a time of deep polarization, this moment is testing how far Britt, and other lawmakers, are willing to go to tackle knotty policy problems captivating national attention.   A front row seat   Veteran Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers first met Britt when she was a teenager attending a prestigious girls leadership program. Flowers was so impressed, he called up his old friend, Alabama's long-serving Republican senator, Richard Shelby.   \"And I said, 'Shelby, I just met a young woman who's got U.S. Senator or governor written all over her.\"   \n   Britt went to work on Capitol Hill for Shelby, who for years was the top Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a group so bipartisan in nature that Hill veterans are known to joke about three categories of lawmakers — Republicans, Democrats and appropriators.   Shelby taught young aides that your word is your bond and making deals across the aisle hinges on trust, and often, genuine friendship. Shelby and his counterpart on the committee, former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., were like brothers, Flowers said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Katie Britt for the 118th Congress on Jan. 3, 2023. At 40 years old, Britt became the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate.\n                \n                    Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Quite frankly, it's the ingredient that is necessary for any of that to come together,\" says Dayne Cutrell, a former Shelby staffer who overlapped with Britt. \"Not only does she see it because of who she is, but she had a front row seat to somebody that was able to do it for years to the benefit of the state.\"   Cutrell remembers when Britt eventually became Shelby's chief of staff, she made a point of meeting with all 99 other Senate chiefs. \"And not only did she do it, she did it in like two weeks,\" Cutrell said.   When Shelby retired after 2022, Britt, at 40 years old, became the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate. In her Capitol Hill office, Britt displays a gold-framed handbill from Shelby's first campaign for the Alabama Senate in 1970. Her desk was once Shelby's – and before that, Lyndon B. Johnson's.   \"Now that she is a member, she is the same person that wants to know not just you as an individual, but your family and what makes you tick and why it's important,\" Cutrell said.   \"Anybody can go sit in a corner\"   That's in part why Britt was able to help bring Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., onto a deal to end the record-long government shutdown last fall, despite deep opposition from others in his party. The pair already had a relationship from drafting legislation on affordable child care.   \n   \"I was testing ideas with her, and when it looked like things might break down, [she would say] 'Hey come on let's keep talking.' We may disagree, but I'll get a read on where's the caucus, where's the White House likely to be on this, and that's helpful,\" Kaine said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britt speaks on the phone at the National Prayer Breakfast in the Kennedy Caucus Room on Capitol Hill on Feb. 05. Britt says her constituents sent her to Washington to find compromise. \"Anybody can go sit in a corner,\" she says.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   At a time when compromise seems to have little political upside, why wade in? Britt says that is what her constituents sent her to Washington to do.   \"Anybody can go sit in a corner,\" Britt said in an interview. \"Two-year-olds do it best, and we have a lot of people that are taking their ball and sitting in the corner. And I just think it's too critical of a moment in our country's history to do that.\"   A delicate balance    For many members, the latest inflection point in the country was the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.   For Britt, it was the viral image of a five-year-old boy in a bunny hat and Spiderman backpack being detained by federal officers there that she could not shake — so much so that she raised questions about the incident with the administration.   There were reports that federal officers were using the boy to lure other potential targets for arrest. Britt's office scheduled a call with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, first reported by The New York Times. Britt said Noem assured her that was not true.   And Britt has refrained from mentioning the boy in her public remarks, instead focusing on criticizing Democrats for refusing to fund the Department of Homeland Security amid negotiations.   \"I'm over it,\" Britt told her colleagues recently on the floor. \"Everybody on that side of the aisle knows that ICE and CBP will continue to be funded. They're going to continue to enforce the law just as they should. Who's going to pay the price? It's the TSA agent, it's the person working at FEMA.\"   \n   That message has frustrated Democratic negotiators who were already irked when Britt called their demands a \"ridiculous Christmas list.\"   \"My wish is for my Republican colleagues to be just as upset as they are about what is going to happen at TSA or FEMA as for the children that are being traumatized right now,\" responded Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Britt's counterpart on the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., talks to Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., during a March 29, 2023 hearing on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Murphy and Britt worked together to negotiate the homeland security funding bill that was set to pass with bipartisan support before the deadly shootings in Minneapolis.   Senate Republicans have signaled that much of the back and forth so far has been directly between Democrats and the White House — and there have been few signs of progress in recent days.   Democrats and Republicans say Britt's appeal as an emerging mediator comes not only from trust she has built across the aisle, but also with her party's leadership in the Senate and the White House.   Maintaining all three is a delicate balance.   In 2025 Britt voted in line with President Trump 100% of the time on legislation he took a position on, according to Congressional Quarterly.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britt listens as President Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Oct.16, 2025. Britt has been a reliable vote for the president's agenda, but criticized a racist video posted on his social media.\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But she was one of a few Republicans to criticize a racist video posted on President Trump's social media, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. Britt said the video \"should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.\"   Trump saw the critical comment as disloyalty, according to CNN, a report Britt's office called \"fake news.\"   Ideologues and facilitators    Flowers, the Alabama columnist, sees two types of senators: idealogues: \"You may have one who will be a Fox News-chasing publicity hound who wants to be known as a right-wing fire eater,\" he said.   And facilitators, like Shelby. \"That's what Katie's role will be: bring home the bacon, get things done for Alabama, as well as voting conservative,\" Flowers said.   \n   Flowers says it is not as easy to be a facilitator as it was in Shelby's day. He said he hopes Britt won't be pulled away from her approach as she steps further onto the national stage.   \"I think it is harder now to do that, but maybe she can balance it,\" Flowers said. \"She doesn't owe Trump anything. She'll be there long after Trump's gone.\"\n",

Mark Kelly's request for a preliminary injunction against Pete Hegseth, in a lawsuit filed by the Arizona Democrat accusing the defense secretary of trying to punish him for his political speech.   Kelly, a former Navy Captain, sued Hegseth in January, one week after the defense secretary moved to formally censure him for participating in a video where he and several Democratic lawmakers told U.S. servicemembers they can refuse illegal orders.   \"Our rules are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly says in the video.   \n   Hegseth has labeled Kelly's statements as \"seditious\" and announced a review of his retirement grade, which could lead to a demotion in rank and reduction in retirement pay.   Thursday's ruling temporarily blocks the Pentagon from taking steps to discipline Kelly. It was issued by Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.   \"This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly's First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,\" Leon wrote in his opinion. \"After all, as Bob Dylan famously said, 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.'\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives on Capitol Hill for a classified briefing with senators on the situation in Venezuela on January 7.\n                \n                    J.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In his lawsuit, Kelly's lawyers argued that the Pentagon review was both \"unconstitutional and legally baseless.\"   \"The First Amendment forbids the government and its officials from punishing disfavored expression or retaliating against protected speech,\" the suit reads. \"That prohibition applies with particular force to legislators speaking on matters of public policy.\"   In a statement following the court's ruling, Kelly said the case was bigger than him.    \"This administration was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they too can be censured or demoted just for speaking out. That's why I couldn't let this stand.\"    \n   \"I appreciate the judge's careful consideration of this case, and the clarity of his ruling,\" he continued. \"But I also know that this might not be over yet, because this President and this administration do not know how to admit when they're wrong.\"    Pentagon officials were not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.    Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers to participate in the video, which was released on social media in November amid concerns from Democrats in Congress about the legality of U.S. military strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats in the Caribbean.    The video drew a furious response from President Trump, who in a post on social media called it \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" Trump also said the lawmakers — all with military or intelligence backgrounds — \"should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.\"    Federal prosecutors attempted to indict the lawmakers, but a grand jury in Washington, D.C., ultimately rejected the effort, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.    It is not clear what charges prosecutors attempted to bring against the lawmakers. Previously the Justice Department had declined to \"confirm or deny the existence of an investigation\" into either Democrat.\n",

NPR observed two online focus groups on Tuesday night, with 14 voters from Arizona who supported Joe Biden in 2020 and then swung to Trump in 2024. Four voters identified themselves as Democrats, three as Republicans and seven as independents.   Twelve of the 14 participants said they felt Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"has gone too far\" in carrying out its operations. And nine participants said they know someone who has changed their daily life out of concern for a possible interaction with ICE. Some said ICE's presence in the border state had begun to directly affect them, as well.   \n   Reflecting on recent immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, where two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot by federal agents, various focus group participants described ICE actions as \"aggressive,\" \"out of control\" and said they worried the country was becoming a \"police state.\"   Rich Thau, who moderated the focus groups, said the economy remains a top concern for these swing voters, but immigration has become \"a more pressing and more urgent concern.\"   \"They want ICE to protect them, but they don't want ICE to be doing it the way they're doing it now,\" he said, \"which is way too present in their lives, way too present in their family and friends' lives.\"   The focus groups were part of the Swing Voter Project conducted by Thau's Engagious and market research firm Sago. NPR is a partner on the project.   \n   \"People shouldn't have to live like that\"   While focus groups don't provide statistically significant results like a poll does, the participants' reflections match survey data, as immigration has become a growing liability for Trump.   Esmerita S. — who identifies as a Democrat — said she was born and raised in the United States and is Hispanic. She said an ICE detention center was built close by, which has made her nervous to walk around. (Participants agreed to be part of the focus groups on condition that they be identified by their first names and last initials only.)   \n   \"I don't want to go to Starbucks just down the street from there because I'm like, 'What if they're there and I look like I'm Hispanic?' \" she said. \"That's scary. People shouldn't have to live like that.\"   Carolyn B. — also a Democrat — said ICE agents were recently in her neighborhood intimidating older residents.   \"They were going door to door knocking, asking the people — and I live in a 55, an older community — and they were trying to find Asian people so that they could deport them,\" she said. \"The show of force and power. And they don't follow any rules and they do whatever they want. It's just too much.\"   Stephanie O., an independent voter originally from Nigeria, said she's observed members of her community wrongfully detained, and it's made her worry about ending up in the same situation.   \"And so it's like you have to almost carry your passports just in case I look like someone who is here illegally,\" she said.   \n   While many of the focus group participants said overall they support Trump's efforts to decrease illegal immigration in the country, they have serious worries about how that work is being done.   \"It just escalates a situation where if [federal agents] came in in proper attire and acted properly, I think a lot of people are tired of the immigration problem and would be OK with it,\" said Nancy P., an independent voter. \"It's just the whole way they're doing it.\"   Support for ICE — but with reforms   The voters expressed support for a range of proposed immigration enforcement reforms currently before Congress. Many of these reforms are backed primarily by Democrats.   Requiring independent investigations after incidents take place and requiring that agents wear body cameras had unanimous support among focus group participants. Prohibiting the use of face coverings was among the least popular proposals.   \n   No one supported abolishing ICE altogether.   \n   \"You can't have a country without borders, and someone needs to enforce that,\" said Scott G., a self-described independent.   Thau said the lesson Republicans should draw from these conversations is that they need to \"rein in\" ICE. However, Democrats, he said, should be wary of embracing calls to eliminate the agency altogether — a stance the party has not embraced.   Economic anxiety, and other takeaways   Most voters said they have more anxiety about the economy now, as compared with a year ago. While several people mentioned Trump's tariffs as worsening the cost of living and layoffs across different sectors, others were reluctant to blame the president for the economy.   Most voters said they disapprove of Trump's job performance.   Democrats, though, weren't popular, with respondents using words like \"disjointed\" and \"disappointing\" to describe the party.\n",

That allows more immigration detentions to occur at jails rather than in operations on the street.  He also said local law enforcement agencies are responding more quickly and consistently to protests.    \n   \"This surge operation and our work here with state and local officials to improve coordination and achieve mutual goals, as well as our efforts to address issues of concern here on the ground, have yielded the successful results we have came here for,\" Homan said. \"We are leaving Minnesota safer.\"    Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who from the outset fiercely opposed the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, declared victory.    \"They thought they could break us, but a love for our neighbors and a resolve to endure can outlast an occupation,\" Frey posted on X.  \"These patriots of Minneapolis are showing that it's not just about resistance — standing with our neighbors is deeply American.\"   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the state can now move forward.   \"The long road to recovery starts now,\" Walz posted on X after Homan's news conference. \"The impact on our economy, our schools, and people's lives won't be reversed overnight. That work starts today.\"   In a news conference Thursday morning, Walz acknowledged it will take time for many Minnesota residents to feel safe enough to leave their homes without fear of apprehension by federal immigration agents.    \"It's going to be a long road,\" he said. \"Our sense of normalcy was shook to the core. The trauma that's been inflicted, certainly across an immigrant community, but to every single Minnesotan, is unlike anything we've witnessed.\"   \n   Walz said nothing has changed about the way Minnesota is addressing immigration enforcement. The state supports targeted enforcement, he said. When asked what has changed, Walz said border czar Tom Homan's arrival in Minnesota last week kicked off conversations with state and local officials.   Walz criticized other Trump administration officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who previously led operations on the ground in Minnesota, saying they had not engaged in talks — a move Walz characterized as \"arrogance.\"     Walz also said Homan's earlier remark that the two leaders disagree on a lot of things was \"an understatement.\"   The governor's take on today's announcement is that the Trump administration knew it needed to withdraw federal agents, particularly after the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, \"but in very Trumpian fashion, they needed to save face,\" Walz said.   In January, federal immigration agents shot and killed Pretti and Macklin Good, two U.S. citizens. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division is investigating Pretti's death but not the killing of Macklin Good.   Homan notably did not mention the names of Pretti or Macklin Good during Thursday's news conference.   \"I don't want to see any more bloodshed,\" he said. \"I pray every night for the safety of our law enforcement personnel and the safety of those in the community, whether you're here legally or illegally. I don't want to see anybody harmed. If you break the law, we're going to arrest you.\"   Earlier this week, Walz suggested the end of the crackdown was imminent, following recent talks with White House officials.   On Feb. 4, Homan announced plans to withdraw 700 of the roughly 3,000 agents sent to Minnesota. Further reductions, he said then, would be contingent on more cooperation from local officials. That  included giving federal officials greater access to local jails to pick up undocumented people set to be released. In Thursday's briefing, Homan said those agreements have been strengthened.   \n   \"Under President Trump's direction, we have obtained an unprecedented level of coordination with law enforcement officials that is focused on promoting public safety across the entire state,\" he said. \"While I don't agree with Gov. Walz and Attorney General [Keith] Ellison on everything, I appreciate the support the governor gives the state agencies, who coordinate with us in a manner intended to promote public safety. And I appreciate the AG having an open dialogue with me.\"   Homan said a \"small footprint of personnel\" will remain to close out the operation and \"transition full command and control back to the field office.\" Homan will remain in Minneapolis to oversee the drawdown.    During his briefing Thursday, Homan spent several minutes defending the work of ICE agents and touting thousands of arrests of undocumented people he called criminals.  He reported a \"notable decrease\" in activity from what he called unlawful agitators.\n",

    "body": "\n      Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed with Democratic lawmakers who questioned her about the Epstein files and the weaponization of the Justice Department at an oversight hearing Wednesday.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Attorney General Pam Bondi's appearance before Congress on Wednesday turned into a shouting match with lawmakers.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The hearing, in theory, was going to focus on oversight of the Justice Department. Instead, Bondi insulted lawmakers and ducked questions about documents relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a moment, we'll speak with one of the Democratic lawmakers, Pramila Jayapal. First, we get the facts.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Carrie Johnson followed the hearing. Carrie, I mean, even for Congress, this one was a doozy.CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Definitely not business as usual. There was a lot of hostility. Pam Bondi came into this House judiciary hearing prepared to attack Democrats on the panel when they tried to ask her about the messy rollout of the Epstein files and other controversies at the Justice Department. Congressman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York, he wanted to know whether anyone else who worked with Jeffrey Epstein would be prosecuted. Here's a taste of how that went.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAM BONDI: I find it...JERRY NADLER: How many have you indicted?BONDI: Excuse me. I'm going to answer the question.NADLER: Answer my question.BONDI: No. I'm going to answer the question the way I want to answer the question.NADLER: No.BONDI: Your theatrics are ridiculous.NADLER: You're going to answer the question the way I asked it.BONDI: Chairman...JOHNSON: The congressman never got an answer about whether anyone else might be under investigation. And the attorney general called other lawmakers on the panel washed-up and bad lawyers, and on it went for hours.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, it sure did. Several Epstein survivors, though, who had been trafficked by him were in the hearing room. Did the attorney general react to them or acknowledge them in any way?JOHNSON: At one point, Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington asked Pam Bondi to turn around and apologize to some of the victims in the room for how they were treated by the Justice Department. In its release of some 3 million pages, some of those people's identities and nude images appeared in public on the DOJ website. Bondi responded by accusing the congresswoman who asked the question of engaging in gutter politics, and she also defended her record in law enforcement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BONDI: I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so. I am deeply sorry for what any victim - any victim - has been through, especially as a result of that monster.MARTÍNEZ: All right. What about Republicans on the panel when they had their chance to interact with the attorney general?JOHNSON: They asked Pam Bondi about the enormous drop in violent crime across the country. They praised the Trump administration for tough immigration enforcement, and they gave her some time to respond to some of the harsher questions from Democrats. The only Republican on the panel who pushed back on the attorney general is Thomas Massie of Kentucky. He sponsored that law to release the Epstein files, and he says the DOJ effort has been a massive failure because it seems like prosecutors continue to black out the names of men who behaved badly. Massie told the AG this is a cover-up that spans decades, and she's responsible for part of it.MARTÍNEZ: You know, the DOJ is really at the center of so many different controversies, including a lot of efforts to prosecute President Trump's political foes. I'm wondering if that came up at all in the hearing.JOHNSON: It really did. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, he sees a pattern here. Here's Raskin at the hearing.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE RASKIN: You've turned the people's Department of Justice into Trump's instrument of revenge. Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza, and you deliver every time.JOHNSON: Remember, just this week, prosecutors tried and failed to get a grand jury to indict Democratic lawmakers who made a video telling American service members to follow their oaths and the law. DOJ has also brought cases against the former FBI director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Tish James. Both those cases have been dismissed, but DOJ continues to investigate Trump's perceived political foes.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thanks.JOHNSON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Congressman Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., about growing Republican opposition to President Trump's tariffs.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  One of the six Republicans who voted against the president is Congressman Kevin Kiley of California, who's on the line. Congressman, good morning.KEVIN KILEY: Good morning.INSKEEP: I think it's illuminating to describe the mechanics of exactly what you did here. The president declared an emergency under a particular law to justify tariffs. So what did you then vote for or against?KILEY: Yeah. So in this case, the president declares an emergency and then claims that that gives him the authority to impose tariffs. So Congress actually has an obligation under the National Emergencies Act to review every six months whether that emergency still exists. And - but House leadership, through an accounting trick, has been stopping us from actually doing that with respect to this emergency and others that the president has declared.And so a couple days ago, we finally overcame that and restored the ability of Congress to make that determination. And what we voted on yesterday was whether the emergency that he had declared with respect to Canada, which actually concerns fentanyl, still exists. And actually, to the extent that there was one, Canada has cracked down on fentanyl. And so my review of the facts suggested that this was the time to say that it is - the basis for the emergency has lapsed, and it's not appropriate to extend it another six months.INSKEEP: I do love thinking about this parliamentary trick that you're referring to. As I understand it, House Republican leaders declared about a year ago that the next many, many, many days of legislative sessions, for purposes of the law, will count as only one day so that no days would pass toward this deadline where you could vote. Is that right?KILEY: Yeah, basically. I mean, every six months, Congress actually has an obligation to say, is this emergency still in existence? And then it's sort of, like, a 15-day trigger once you reach that point. And so what the rule that the House leadership has adopted repeatedly now says is that from such-and-such time to such-and-such time - in this case, it would have been till July - those are not days. So even though days are passing, these don't count as days on the calendar.INSKEEP: Has Congress then been abdicating its authority to restrain and oversee the president?KILEY: Well, certainly, Congress has not been executing the authority that has been established under this particular statute for Congress to sort of have this check-and-balance built into the system. And so that's what we've now restored.INSKEEP: So on the substance, would you presume that tariffs themselves are a bad idea in this case - the president's tariffs on Canada?KILEY: Well, in this particular case, there's absolutely no doubt that, you know, it has had an impact on prices when it comes to cars and when it comes to construction in particular. And, you know, I think we've heard a lot of feedback on that. There's also a special issue with respect to Canada because we have a free trade agreement here that was pretty recently signed. So I think if you have other votes on other tariffs, there will be different considerations in play. But that's how I approach this sort of thing, you know?INSKEEP: Why do you think it is that so many of your Republican colleagues have not voted that way, have not seen it that way, have not been willing to challenge the president on this?KILEY: You know, I can't speak for them. I know that there are some of us who believe that it is important that Congress is involved here and, you know, whatever your particular view is on tariff policy in general or this particular set of tariffs, that this is an issue where Congress was meant to have a role. And so I think that that's what you saw some of us asserting yesterday.INSKEEP: And you're saying that some of your lawmakers have not been willing to do their jobs?KILEY: No, that's not what I'm saying at all. People have...INSKEEP: Right.KILEY: ...Different reasons for viewing these things differently. And even in this particular case, maybe some had - came to the determination that whatever the basis for the emergency was was ongoing. So I wouldn't, you know, characterize it that way. But I do believe that all of us, you know, should have the right to vote and to vote according to the facts and the right policy as we see it.INSKEEP: The president, as I understood it, has said that he is willing to support primary challengers to those who disagreed with him on this issue. That would include you. Do you think there's a serious threat? I heard you chuckle. Do you think it's a serious threat? And do you think that you're representing your constituents with this vote?KILEY: I do. I think that - you know, I ran for office pledging to be an independent voice for my district. And I think that, you know, the folks I represent know that I believe very firmly in the importance of checks and balances and the authority of Congress under Article 1. And so, you know, I try to do what I think is right by my district, by my state, by the country. And you can't really just, you know, approach every vote thinking about what the downstream political obstacles might be.INSKEEP: The president has supported primary challengers to other people who were, in turn, defeated. Are you ready for that?KILEY: I'm ready to run on my record. And I'm confident that my constituents will, you know, judge it accordingly.INSKEEP: How are you feeling overall about Republicans in the 2026 election, the fall election coming up?KILEY: Well, you know, it's going to be, I think, a really important election for the country, and I think affordability is going to be front and center. And so I think that there's ways in which we've made important progress. I think that this particular, you know, vote yesterday is part of that. But I think there are areas where we, you know, have more work to do. In my state, in particular, in California, we have the highest cost of living in the country, so that's going to be a continued focus for me this year.INSKEEP: Republican Congressman Kevin Kiley of California. Thanks for your time.KILEY: Of course. Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Thursday's oversight hearing by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security began with a rebuke by Chairman Rand Paul, R-Ky., who asked leaders from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to watch frame-by-frame video of the events leading up to the death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti.    \n   Paul then asked the officials if the use of force on display in the video — from women being shoved, the close use of pepper spray, to the ultimate shots fired at Pretti by Border Patrol — were justified tactics. And he asked if any of the actions were \"deescalatory.\"   \"It's clearly evident that the public trust has been lost. To restore trust in ICE and Border Patrol, they must admit their mistakes, be honest and forthright with their rules of engagement and pledge to reform,\" Paul said in his opening remarks.   \"It's terrible police work, but there has to ultimately be repercussions. I think he [Pretti] is retreating at every moment,\" Paul said. \"He's trying to get away, and he's being sprayed in the face. I don't think that's de-escalatory. That's an escalatory thing.\"   Sitting at the witness table were ICE acting Director Todd Lyons, CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott and Joseph Edlow, director of USCIS. Lyons testified that 37 ICE officers had been investigated in the last year for use of force and detailed the changes to new officer training as the agency onboarded 12,000 new recruits. But in response to questions about Pretti's death, they declined to provide specifics on the ongoing investigation but noted that body camera footage would eventually be released.   \n   The three DHS officials appeared before the committee as their department is one day away from a potential shutdown and as the Trump administration has vowed to continue reducing its immigration enforcement presence in Minneapolis.    On the issue of use of force, the committee's top two leaders were largely in agreement Thursday that the actions of officials in Minnesota went too far. Consensus beyond that, however, was harder to find.    Democrats, several of which successfully advocated last month to strip DHS from a broader government funding deal, focused on use of force, engagement with U.S. citizens and training.   Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, urged Paul and Democrats to not jump to conclusions over the actions of the agents involved in the Pretti shooting.   \"I find it outrageous that we are going into a path where watching a video on social media is enough to indict people,\" Moreno said.   Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and James Lankford, R-Okla., focused on the threats law enforcement officials face amid an increasing spotlight on their operations.   Several Democrats on the committee were quick to call for DHS' funding to be separated after two U.S. citizens, including Pretti, were killed in Minneapolis. They have since laid out a list of demands that includes mandating the use of body cameras and judicial warrants, banning the use of masks and arrests in hospitals, schools and churches.   Immigration officials sidestepped questions on Noem's claims   The three officials were testifying for the second time this week — they also appeared before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday.   And for the second time this week, the officials declined to support the claims made by Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem in the immediate aftermath of Pretti's death — namely her accusation that he was a domestic terrorist.   When asked if he, or anyone under his command, had provided information to lead to that conclusion, CBP Commissioner Scott said no. Both Scott and Lyons said they could not \"speculate on what someone else would say\" or why Noem thought that at the time.   \n   When pressed on similar comments made by top White House officials, Lyons said, \"any comments that are made publicly, privately, text, email, or Instagram posts, whatever is going to put a bias on the investigation.\"   Senators heard from top Minnesota officials first   During the hearing there was also testimony from Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, and Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections. They faced questions about local law enforcement collaboration with federal immigration officers and the protests against the surge that continued for weeks.   \"I want to be clear that there is a legitimate need for immigration enforcement and for addressing those people who represent, in particular, a threat to public safety,\" Schnell said. \"But I think what we want is to return to the days where there is close collaboration ... where we can focus on key issues of community and public safety across our country.\"   As their testimony began, White House Border Czar Tom Homan announced from Minnesota that President Trump has agreed that the immigration surge in the state will conclude.   DHS budget negotiations remain in limbo   Last month, the Senate stripped funding for the Department of Homeland Security from a broader federal spending package. With the agency's baseline funding due to expire Friday at midnight, lawmakers are now considering potential changes to immigration enforcement at the behest of Democrats, who have refused to fund the agency without reforms.   Democrats produced legislative text over the weekend encapsulating their key demands. The White House responded with a counteroffer that top Democrats have described as \"incomplete and insufficient.\"   Republicans have shown scattered support for some proposals, such as body cameras. But the parties remain deeply divided around other potential reforms and negotiations have been faltering.   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has described the talks as making progress, though he has acknowledged that they are all but certain to not bear fruit before the Friday deadline, when funding runs out and members in both chambers are set to leave for a week-long recess.   \n   But most Democrats, even a number of them who continued voting with Republicans last fall to end the government shutdown, say they will not support another short-term DHS funding measure even if it means a lapse in funding for the department.   \"We are asking our colleagues and the White House to work with us,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., told reporters on Tuesday. \"Unfortunately we're not seeing that.\"   If lawmakers don't reach a deal this week, another stopgap bill to fund DHS in the short term would be needed. A lapse in funding would affect agencies inside DHS, like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially affecting air travel and disaster response.   During Tuesday's hearing, all three agency leaders hedged in response to questions about whether their operations would be affected if DHS shuts down on Friday. Edlow of USCIS reminded lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   ICE and CBP both got a huge infusion of cash from Congress in Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer — making ICE the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency. That funding could allow the agencies to continue working with pay as they did during the last shutdown in the fall.\n",

It would also require a valid photo identification before voters can cast ballots, which some states already demand. It was approved on a mostly party-line vote, 218-213.   Republicans said the legislation is needed to prevent voter fraud, but Democrats warn it will disenfranchise millions of Americans by making it harder to vote. Federal law already requires that voters in national elections be U.S. citizens, but there's no requirement to provide documentary proof. Experts said voter fraud is extremely rare, and very few noncitizens ever slip through the cracks. Fewer than one in 10 Americans don't have paperwork proving they are citizens.   \n   \"Some of my colleagues will call this voter suppression or Jim Crow 2.0,\" said Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., presenting the package at a committee hearing.   But he said \"those allegations are false,\" and he argued the bill is needed to enforce existing laws, particularly those that bar immigrants who are not citizens from voting. \"The current law is not strong enough,\" he said.   Election turmoil shadows the vote   The GOP's sudden push to change voting rules at the start of the midterm election season is raising red flags, particularly because President Donald Trump has suggested he wants to nationalize U.S. elections, which, under the Constitution, are designed to be run by individual states.   The Trump administration recently seized ballots in Georgia from the 2020 election, which the president insists he won despite his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. The Department of Justice is demanding voter rolls from states, including Michigan, where a federal judge this week dismissed the department's lawsuit seeking the voter files. Secretaries of state have raised concerns that voters' personal data may be shared with Homeland Security to verify citizenship and could result in people being unlawfully purged from the rolls.   \"Let me be clear what this is about: It's about Republicans trying to rig the next election,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, during a hearing ahead of the floor vote. \"Republicans are pushing the Save America Act because they want fewer Americans to vote. It's that simple.\"   \n   The legislation is actually a do-over of a similar bill the House approved last year, which also sought to clamp down on fraudulent voting, particularly among noncitizens. It won the support of four House Democrats, but stalled in the Republican-led Senate. Only one Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, voted for the revised bill.   This version toughens some of the requirements further, while creating a process for those whose names may have changed, particularly during marriage, to provide the paperwork necessary and further attest to their identity.   It also requires states to share their voter information with the Department of Homeland Security, as a way to verify the citizenship of the names on the voter rolls. That has drawn pushback from elections officials as potentially intrusive on people's privacy.   \n   Warnings from state election officials   The new rules in the bill would take effect immediately, if the bill is passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law.   But with primary elections getting underway next month, critics said the sudden shift would be difficult for state election officials to implement and potentially confuse voters.   Voting experts have warned that more than 20 million U.S. citizens of voting age do not have proof of their citizenship readily available. Almost half of Americans do not have a U.S. passport.   \"Election Day is fast approaching,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. \"Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources.\"   The fight ahead in the Senate   In the Senate, where Republicans also have majority control, there does not appear to be enough support to push the bill past the chamber's filibuster rules, which largely require 60 votes to advance legislation.   \n   That frustration has led some Republicans, led by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, to push for a process that would skip the 60-vote threshold in this case, and allow the bill to be debated through a so-called standing filibuster — a process that would open the door to potentially endless debate.   Lee made the case to GOP senators at a closed-door lunch this week, and some said afterward they are mulling the concept.   \"I think most people's minds are open,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., \"My mind's certainly open.\"   But Murkowski of Alaska said she is flat out against the legislation.   \"Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the 'times, places, and manner' of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,\" she said.   Karen Brinson Bell of Advance Elections, a nonpartisan consulting firm, said the bill adds numerous requirements for state and local election officials with no additional funding.   \"Election officials have a simple request of Congress — that you help share their burdens not add to them,\" she said.\n",

Six House Republicans bucked party leaders and joined Democrats to vote against tariffs that the United States imposes on goods Americans import from Canada. That was enough for the measure to pass. It was a rare case where just enough Republicans voted independently of the president. In a few minutes, we're going to hear from one of them, Kevin Kiley of California. We begin with the details.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez is here. Franco, this revolt from some Republicans - it kind of feels like a big deal.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, it really was kind of a stark message to President Trump from those Republicans who joined Democrats on a vote that would essentially reverse the president's tariffs on Canada, you know, especially as we're heading into the midterm campaign season. I mean, Republicans are facing pressure from constituents about high costs and the business community, which is, you know, somewhat afraid to invest with all the uncertainty. And like Steve said, it's just another example of how Republicans are starting to stand up to the president. I mean, Trump, though, is really pushing back, sending a strong message that he'll support primaries against any Republican who votes against his tariffs.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. OK. So let's get into the tariffs, because Trump always talks about how they're critical to the economy - that they bring in billions of dollars into the government. How much water does that hold?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, it is true that it makes a lot of money. In fact, it may be trillions. According to a new Congressional Budget Office report, tariffs are actually expected to help reduce the deficit by over $3 trillion over a decade. But another part of the report points out that it's not foreign companies paying that money. Brendan Duke served at the National Economic Council in the Biden White House. He told me that the CBO report shows companies are passing off 90% of those costs to consumers.BRENDAN DUKE: Which flies directly in the face of the justifications that Trump - and his entire administration - has given for these sweeping taxes. So the CBO report shows that this is a sweeping tax on Americans going shopping at Walmart and Costco.MARTÍNEZ: You know, Franco, we've often seen the president use tariffs as a weapon on friends and foes alike to get the things that he wants. So how might this shape the United States' global image as a financial or economic partner?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to say, but I do think diplomats and foreign leaders are hoping some tariffs are lifted. I spoke to Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He sees deeper symbolism here that goes well beyond Trump and whether the U.S. can be a reliable partner again. And he said that even if all the tariffs are not lifted, some pushback would be seen as a positive sign.MICHAEL O'HANLON: As long as we're trying to push back against this notion that United States plays by different rules than everyone else or that it uses this kind of weapon capriciously in pursuit of a personalized policy agenda, I think that's much better than the perception that America will continue to act this way indefinitely.ORDOÑEZ: Now, Trump has said, quote, \"we're screwed\" if the courts strike down tariffs because the U.S. might be on the hook to pay back billions of dollars in revenue collected from tariffs.MARTÍNEZ: So are we possibly talking about the end of tariffs? I mean, didn't the White House say they did have contingency plans?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. Trump is wedded to them too much, and he's signaled he'll find a way even under an unfavorable ruling by the court. You know, there are different kinds of tariffs that don't fall under what the Supreme Court is deciding. But it does demonstrate some guardrails that Trump is unable to do things at will. And actually, A, it might open him up to more political pressure as Republicans are more willing to break rank ahead of the midterms.MARTÍNEZ: That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thanks a lot.ORDOÑEZ: Thanks, A.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks to Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who says she has a \"list of names\" of people to depose after viewing unredacted versions of the Epstein files.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  All this week, members of Congress have been looking at unredacted versions of the Epstein files. The Justice Department set up a room where they can access documents about the financier who was convicted on sex charges before his death. Wednesday was the turn of Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who is one of four Republicans who defied President Trump and her party to force the disclosures. Mace came on the phone after spending two hours in the room.NANCY MACE: Inside the Justice Department, they have a very small room, kind of like an oversized closet, basically, and there are four desks in the room with four computers. There is someone or two people from the DOJ monitoring you as you sit on those computers. There is a tech person who logs you into the computer. They log you into the computer because they're giving you your own identification. They are tracking all of the documents that members of Congress open. And they're tracking everything that you do in that room. You're not even allowed to use your own paper. You have to use their paper and their pens to write notes down. You can't take photos of anything. No devices in there. No phones or computers, etc. But it's very small, it's very desolate. You figure 535 members of Congress and only four desks. I mean, this could take years to get through.INSKEEP: Yeah. We're talking about millions of pages, and those of us on the outside have gone to this public website where the documents are redacted. And there's a search engine, and it's hard to know where to begin because there's so many things you could search for. What was your method of searching?MACE: Well, I crowdsourced the documents that I wanted to search. I was looking at what people were posting online, documents that were being posted online. I was doing keyword searches of my own. I also had every single employee of mine. We had - on Monday, we put a spreadsheet together, and I printed off the file names and what the subject matter was. My primary focus was to get my hands on documents naming co-conspirators.INSKEEP: Some of your colleagues have gone to the House floor and named names and other information, which they can do with legal protection under the speech and debate clause of the Constitution on the floor of the House. Did you encounter anything that you think you would want to treat in that manner?MACE: Yes, I have. And I am compiling a list of individuals that I want to see named, and they're not necessarily ones that were participating in this sex trafficking, but they are people that likely have a lot of information, whether they're friends, business associates, business partners, people that Jeffrey Epstein lunched with a lot. I'm vetting the list of names I've put together 'cause I want to make sure I'm not accidentally including any victims, but I'm going to request that the oversight committee bring many of these people in to testify because I don't have confidence or faith in the justice system that anybody else will be charged with a crime here. And it's going to be up to us in a bipartisan manner in Congress to have the courage and the bravery to bring these people before America and let them answer for what actually happened.INSKEEP: You have any idea, though, why those names would be redacted by the Justice Department?MACE: I think you're talking about rich and powerful people, famous people. And there are even some memos and emails going back-and-forth with the FBI and DOJ with what do we do? This is a famous person in the files. Well, so what? Who cares?INSKEEP: What have you been thinking about in recent days as some names that were not redacted have come out into public, and we've learned more about, for example, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the time he spent with Epstein, or Bill Gates, for that matter. What have you thought about as you've heard that?MACE: Well, you've seen people not tell the truth because they're embarrassed or ashamed. But I can just say as a mom, I don't know how anyone would bring their kids to a known pedophile island to have lunch with a convicted pedophile. And I don't really care what side of the aisle you're on, right or left, what's wrong is wrong, you know? That doesn't also mean that someone should be fired for not telling the truth. I certainly wouldn't hire that person. But, you know, where's the moral clarity in this? The other thing that really frustrates me in the Epstein files is that this is really being politicized. You know, I see Trump as being exonerated in the files, and then some on the left want to use it as, well, this is a target, and we're going to use this politically. All I want is justice for the Epstein victims. And if we don't do that in the Epstein files, it's never going to happen for anybody else.INSKEEP: What do you do next?MACE: Well, you're going to see a series of requests from me through the oversight committee because that is my jurisdiction. You're going to see a letter from me to the CIA asking for Epstein documents. You're going to see me request more information from the Southern District of New York because the information at the DOJ is redacted, and we're unable to see a lot of information about co-conspirators, and I want the American people to know the truth and I'm going to bring them the truth.INSKEEP: Do you have reason to believe the CIA has some trove of Epstein documents?MACE: Yes, I do.INSKEEP: What do you know?MACE: Well, I would like to know more. The information I have is, again, redacted, but there is an email within the documents where Jeffrey Epstein is talking about a CIA dump. And I have some other emails that are not in the trove of documents at the DOJ that do reference CIA documents, and I have document numbers and file names.INSKEEP: Representative Nancy Mace, thanks for your time.MACE: Thank you so much and God bless.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., offers her assessment of Attorney General Pam Bondi's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Elsewhere in today's program, we hear from Republican lawmaker Nancy Mace, who had a look at the unredacted Epstein files yesterday. Mace described going into a room at the Justice Department where it appeared the administration monitored her searches on a computer.NANCY MACE: There is a tech person who logs you into the computer. They log you into the computer because they're giving you your own identification. They are tracking all of the documents that members of Congress open, and they're tracking everything that you do in that room.INSKEEP: This description of Justice Department surveillance becomes all the more interesting when you see an image from yesterday's congressional hearing. A Reuters photographer captured Attorney General Pam Bondi holding a document labeled, quote, \"Jayapal Pramila search history\" - last name first there. The document had a list of what appeared to be individual Epstein file searches. She had it in hand while sidestepping questions from Representative Pramila Jayapal, who is our next guest. Good morning.PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Good morning.INSKEEP: What are your thoughts about that paper with your search history in the attorney general's hand?JAYAPAL: Well, I think it's completely against the separation of powers. We are supposed to be able to, as lawmakers, go in, review the files, take whatever we want from there, not be surveilled and spied on by the Department of Justice. And it's - that was my search history. It was much more extensive than that, but that was the first page. And she clearly came in prepared with that information. In fact, I think she probably opened it up to us on Monday, two days before the hearing, so she could see what we were going to search and ask her about. Totally unacceptable. And we've asked for, immediately, a change in the process so that the DOJ is not spying on us.INSKEEP: House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about this. He said, I know nothing about it. Not going to comment on it. But if it happened, it's inappropriate. Are you getting any support from Republicans on that?JAYAPAL: Yeah. I actually spoke to Mike last night about this, and I do think that there is bipartisan agreement that we should be able to review those files without the Department of Justice surveilling us. And that's exactly what she was doing, and I think she was doing it in preparation for the hearing. But also, I think they want to know what we're going to - what we're pulling up so that they can use it in some way. That was in her Burn Book. That's what we call that binder with all the opposition research against us that she kept trying to insult different members of Congress with. And I think that she - you know, I think there is bipartisan support to say this cannot continue to happen, and we need a whole new process for how we review these files and who tracks, you know, any of this.INSKEEP: Just so I understand - and he'll speak for himself - but did you understand Speaker Johnson to be on board with taking some kind of action here?JAYAPAL: Well, I think I'll just - I won't say what he said to me, but I'll just say what he said in the public quote. And I showed him and told him exactly what had happened and that the search was my search, and it clearly was surveilling.INSKEEP: Now, you raised in the hearing the failure to redact the names of victims and then the redaction of other people who are in the files, one of them a man named Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. As far as I could tell, you didn't get an answer about that particular case, but you brought it up in any case. What draws that particular redaction to your attention?JAYAPAL: Well, the point I was trying to make is that the Transparency Act that we passed in Congress specifically said you have to redact the private information of survivors and you have to not redact the private information, the personal information of any potential predators or co-conspirators. And that's clearly what that email indicated, is that there was a powerful person who was being protected. He happened to - as I mentioned in my remarks, he happened to also be somebody with financial ties to Donald Trump and personal ties to Steve Bannon. And so I wanted to get her answer about why she was violating - allowing the violation of the law in both these instances, the nonredaction of that personal information of survivors and then the redaction of powerful people that she seemed to be protecting. She didn't want to answer that question.The most important thing to me was getting her to turn around to the survivors and apologize to them because the harm is irreparable. That information is out there now. Nude photographs are out there. Even if the Department of Justice redacts that, that does not bring justice to the survivors. And, you know, it was just stunning to me that she refused to turn to them and take responsibility for what her Department of Justice had done to re-traumatize these survivors.INSKEEP: In the absence of an answer from the Justice Department, I want to understand what you suppose happened here, what you suspect or surmise happened here. Are you saying that you think Justice Department lawyers or somebody else went through the Epstein files looking for names that might be sensitive for the president and tried to redact them?JAYAPAL: Yes. I am absolutely saying that because it - there were too many instances where you saw that happen. It was a pattern of redactions. And on the other side, it was a pattern of not redacting victims' names that I think was meant to intimidate survivors who did try to come forward, because there was a list of 32 survivors. You could have said that that was a mistake - that everything was not redacted - except that there was one name on that list that was redacted. And the title of the email was Epstein Survivors - Victims List. Epstein Victims List.INSKEEP: So somebody clearly got a look at that. It's not like they didn't...JAYAPAL: That's right.INSKEEP: ...Look at the document.JAYAPAL: Exactly.INSKEEP: I want to put you in conversation in a sense with Nancy Mace, who we heard from elsewhere. She clearly agrees with you that she was surveilled in some way, or she thinks so. But she also would push back, perhaps, on some of what you're saying. She alleged in the interview - she alleges in the interview here on NPR that this matter has been politicized, that she feels Trump specifically was exonerated by the files that we have seen so far and that the left, as she puts it, is just wanting to score political points. Do you?JAYAPAL: No. I think that what we want is a full investigation of everyone. Trump is certainly in the files a lot. He clearly had close associations with Epstein. But listen. I think that every single person in here, Democrat or Republican, should be investigated, because there's a lot. I mean, there - this was a big ring of people, and I don't think it was limited to one party. But I do think that Donald Trump tried to use this as a political issue in his campaign, and then found out that he was all over the files and has fought us every step of the way. Had he just at the beginning said, yes, let's release the files - let's go after these people - but that is not what happened.INSKEEP: In about 20 seconds, did you ultimately gain anything, learn anything from that hearing yesterday?JAYAPAL: I mean, I think what I learned is how much Pam Bondi was playing to an audience of one, and that was Donald Trump. She's not the people's lawyer. She's still acting as Trump's personal attorney and turning the Department of Justice into a revenge unit rather than being the lawyer for the people. And I think that was important for the country to see.INSKEEP: Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State. Thanks very much, as always.JAYAPAL: Thank you, Steve.INSKEEP: She is on the House Judiciary Committee, the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

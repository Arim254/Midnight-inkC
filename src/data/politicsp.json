NPR took an early look and found that OpenAI's app could easily generate very realistic videos, including of real individuals (with their permission). The early results are both wowing and worrying researchers.</p>      <p>\"You can create insanely real looking videos, with your friends saying things that they would never say,\" said Solomon Messing, an associate professor at New York University in the Center for Social Media and Politics. \"I think we might be in the era where seeing is not believing.\"</p>   \n   <h3>Deepfake TikTok</h3>   <p>The Sora 2 app looks and feels remarkably like other vertical video social media apps like TikTok. It comes with a few different settings– it's possible to choose videos by mood, for example. Users are allowed control over how their face is in used \"end-to-end\" in AI-generated videos, according to OpenAI. That means users can allow their faces to be used by everyone, a small circle of friends, or only themselves. What's more, they are allowed to remove videos showing their likeness at any time.</p>   <p>Sora also comes with ways to identify its content as AI-generated. Videos downloaded from the app contain moving watermarks bearing the Sora logo, and the files have embedded metadata that identifies them as AI-made, <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/launching-sora-responsibly/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the company</a>. </p>   <p>OpenAI says it has placed guardrails on what the app can make. A company spokesperson also directed NPR to Sora's <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/50d5973c-c4ff-4c2d-986f-c72b5d0ff069/sora_2_system_card.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">system card</a>, which prohibits generating content that could be used for things like \"deceit, fraud, scams, spam, or impersonation.\"</p>   <p>\"To support enforcement, we provide in-app reporting, combine automation with human review to detect patterns of misuse, and apply penalties or remove content when violations occur,\" the document reads.</p>   <p>But NPR's brief time using the app found that the guardrails appeared to be somewhat loose around Sora. While many prompts were refused, it was possible to generate videos that support conspiracy theories. For example it was easy to create a video of what appeared to be President Richard Nixon giving a televised address telling America the moon landing was faked.</p>      <p>And one of astronaut Neil Armstrong removing his helmet on the moon.</p>      <p>NPR was also able to generate videos that depicted a drone attack on a power plant. That too seemed to violate guidelines on violence and (possibly) terrorism.</p>   \n   <p>In addition, the app seemed to contain other loopholes. NPR was able to get it to produce short videos on topics related to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons in direct contradiction of OpenAI's <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/\" target=\"_blank\">global usage policies</a>.  (The videos created were never shared and contained inaccuracies that would make them useless to anyone seeking this kind of information.)</p>   <h3>Clown on the run</h3>   <p>While it's unclear whether other users were finding similar exploits, a quick review of content shows that Sora is being used to generate an enormous volume of videos depicting trademarked brands and copyrighted material. One video depicted Ronald McDonald fleeing police in a hamburger car. Many others included characters from popular cartoons and video games.</p>      <p>OpenAI told NPR that it was aware of the use of copyrighted material in Sora but felt it was giving its users more freedom by allowing it. </p>   <p>\"People are eager to engage with their family and friends through their own imaginations, as well as stories, characters, and worlds they love, and we see new opportunities for creators to deepen their connection with the fans,\" said Vaun Shetty, OpenAI's head of media partnerships, in a written statement shared with NPR. \"We'll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests.\"</p>   \n   <p>OpenAI is currently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5258946/the-new-york-times-takes-openai-to-court-for-copyright-infringement\">being sued</a> by <em>The New York Times</em> for copyright infringement with its Large Language Model, ChatGPT.</p>   <h3>Brave Virtual World</h3>   <p>Just what the effect of a social media world driven entirely by AI remains unclear, said Messing. Many researchers were deeply concerned about \"deepfakes\" when AI video first appeared, and yet few of those videos gain traction. \"We were all collectively panicked about deepfakes a couple of years ago, but society hasn't really decayed because of deepfakes,\" he said.</p>      <p>At the same time, Messing said, the videos so easily created by the Sora app could be the ushering in of a new era where seeing online is no longer believing: \"This just leaves me sort of speechless,\" he said. \"I did not quite understand just how good the content is.\"</p>\n</div>",

Since 2021, those have kept ACA plans affordable for people who get their insurance this way. </p>   <p>Earlier this week, Democrats in the Senate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5555966/government-shutdown-democrats-elizabeth-warren-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">refused to vote</a> for the Republican short-term funding bill that did not include an extension of the enhanced premium tax credits.</p>   <p>So why do they matter?</p>   \n   <p>The enhanced tax credits are important for people who don't get health insurance through their job or a public program like Medicare or Medicaid. This year enrollment hit a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5252585/affordable-care-act-trump-biden-health-insurance-deadline\" target=\"_blank\">record 24 million</a>.</p>   <p>That is only about 7% of the U.S. population, but the people who rely on these plans are an influential group that includes small business owners, farmers and ranchers, says <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/person/cynthia-cox/\" target=\"_blank\">Cynthia Cox</a>, vice president and director of the Program on the ACA at the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.</p>   <p>Cox and her team just did <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\" target=\"_blank\">an analysis</a> on what will happen to people's premiums next year if Congress doesn't extend the enhanced subsidies.</p>   <p>\"On average, we're expecting premium payments by enrollees to increase by 114%,\" she says.</p>   <p>That means a lot of people are going to have to pay double the monthly premium they're paying now.</p>   \n   <p>Or, says Cox, they might have to switch to a higher-deductible plan, change jobs to one that offers insurance, or they might lose their coverage.</p>   <p>The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61734-Health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> that 4 million people will become uninsured if the enhanced tax credits expire. </p>   <p>It also estimates that extending the policy will cost the government a lot — $350 billion over 10 years.</p>   <p>Premium tax credits have been critical to increasing enrollment in ACA plans.</p>   <p>When the ACA was passed in 2010, Congress created a sliding scale to give people a break on their premiums based on income. But premiums were still too high for a lot of people and those with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level had to pay full price, says <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RXPVAA4/sabrina-corlette\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina Corlette</a>, project director at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.</p>   \n   <p>\"So there was a chunk of folks who just were really struggling to afford\" their premiums, she says. And enrollment was sluggish.</p>   <p>So in 2021, Congress stepped in with a lot more federal funding, which made premiums more affordable <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/explaining-health-care-reform-questions-about-health-insurance-subsidies/\" target=\"_blank\">for people of all income levels.</a></p>   <p>It was an \"incredibly successful effort to get more people into coverage and reduce the uninsured rate,\" says Corlette.</p>   <p>Some Republican lawmakers say the current enhanced tax credits are just too expensive. Other Republicans say they're open to extending the policy but not as part of the shutdown fight.</p>   <p>\"That premium support program doesn't even expire until next year. So why are you shutting down the government on Oct. 1 because of a program that doesn't even expire for another few months?\" Vice President Vance said<strong> </strong>on Fox News on Wednesday.</p>   <p>Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., says that actually, it is an urgent issue. As she explained in a press conference Wednesday, open enrollment for ACA plans starts Nov. 1.</p>   <p>\"Later is too late,\" she said. \"The new higher health care rates, those are being set right now. Notifications to families — they're in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away and families are panicking.\"</p>   <p>For Cox, having this relatively small slice of the health insurance pie dominating the political universe takes her back to the repeal and replace fight of 2017 and countless standoffs over the Affordable Care Act since then.</p>   <p>\"Obamacare has always been the center of a political firestorm, at least in health policy,\" she said. \"Here we are again.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-NY, about the ongoing budget negotiations and the impact of the government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> Let's turn now to Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. His congressional district includes large parts of the Bronx in New York City. Good morning, Congressman, and thanks for joining us.</p><p>RITCHIE TORRES: It's an honor to be with you.</p><p>FADEL: So I want to start with what we heard there. The president is threatening to cut programs the Democrats, quote, \"like.\" This morning, he threatened to cut, quote, \"many Democrat agencies,\" referring to federal agencies. And he's threatening mass layoffs. Is this going to work and get Democrats back at the table?</p><p>TORRES: Well, there's nothing new there. Like, Donald Trump has been weaponizing government against his political enemies. He has been defunding programs. He has been engaging in mass firings long before the government shutdown. He has never needed a government shutdown to govern like an authoritarian. But the most important point is that there's a clear contrast. You know, Democrats are in Washington, D.C., intent on reopening the government and keeping health care affordable, whereas, Republicans are on vacation. And Republicans have been more than content to let the government shut down and let millions of Americans see massive spikes in their health care costs, and that is unacceptable to Democrats.</p><p>FADEL: Are you worried that this strategy might backfire, and Americans will blame your party because the government shutdown is painful the longer it goes on? What are you hearing from your constituents?</p><p>TORRES: Look, the party that holds the power has the responsibility. Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House and therefore bear ultimate responsibility for the shutdown.</p><p>Now, my constituents are primarily concerned about the cost of living, particularly the cost of health care, which is the leading cause of bankruptcies in America. The cost of health care's crushing working families. And we cannot stand by idly and allow 4 million Americans to lose their health insurance, allow 24 million Americans to see a premium increase of 75%, allow our hospitals to absorb the loss of $20 billion. Like, that is unacceptable. Our health care system is in danger of falling off a cliff. And we're going to do everything we can to reopen the government and to protect health care.</p><p>FADEL: Let me ask about that because that is what the Democrats have said is behind them not getting on board with this continuing resolution, right? And Republicans wouldn't even allow the Democrats' counterproposal onto the House floor. I mean, how is this shutdown helping to achieve the goal of restoring health care cuts and preserving these Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - subsidies from expiring in December?</p><p>TORRES: Look, for Democrats, doing nothing is not an option. Like, we have to protect our health care system. Republicans cannot be trusted to do the right thing on their own. Like, what we need is not trust but verification. And the best form of verification is an actual bipartisan agreement that reopens the government and protects health care, protects the ACA enhanced premium tax credits.</p><p>FADEL: Why do you need to get it in this way? I mean, why not agree to continuing resolution and then negotiate with Republicans later, which is what they're saying?</p><p>TORRES: Again, a party that eviscerates Medicaid by a trillion dollars cannot be trusted to protect health care. Like, we have no choice but to pursue a negotiated outcome. The Republicans are more than happy to let 4 million people lose their health insurance, are more than happy to let 24 million people see a 75% increase in their premiums. Like, Republicans, you know - we're not going to put our faith in Republicans who gutted Medicaid by a trillion dollars. That's the wrong strategy.</p><p>FADEL: And what do you say to constituents who will suffer during the shutdown, who maybe are furloughed, who might be one of the people that gets laid off? What do you say to them?</p><p>TORRES: Look, my constituents want the Democratic Party to fight. Like, those of us who are Democrats have a simple choice. We can either stand by passively and allow Donald Trump to gut our democracy, to gut our health care, or we can fight. And we've chosen to fight for the health care of the American people. And the majority of Americans want to see an agreement that both reopens the government but also preserves health care - affordable health care for tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>FADEL: And really quickly, are you hearing any more willingness from Republicans on this?</p><p>TORRES: Look, so far, Republicans remain on vacation, but we're going to do everything we can to pressure the Republicans to return to D.C. and reopen the government because - and do the people's work.</p><p>FADEL: Ritchie Torres is a Democratic congressman from New York. Thank you for your time.</p><p>TORRES: Of course.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

With national park visitor centers locked and hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed, Republicans and Democrats say voters should hold the other side responsible for the fallout.</p>   <p>But in Georgia, some are focused less on who's to blame than how long the shutdown will last.</p>   <p>The last shutdown dragged on for 35 days from Dec. 2018 to Jan. 2019. Among the hardest hit were Transportation Security Administration employees at Atlanta's humungous airport who had to keep working without pay.</p>   <p>\"We did mass distributions of food and there were hundreds of cars in line of people who needed help,\" said Atlanta Community Food Bank president Kyle Waide.</p>   \n   <p>He said it is not clear yet if his organization will be seeing a small uptick in need or something more catastrophic if the shutdown continues for weeks.</p>   <p>Waide said the food bank will do what it can to help families. But if funding runs dry for federal food aid programs such as Women Infants and Children, or WIC, the nonprofit cannot meet the full need for some necessities like baby formula.</p>   <p>\"Nonetheless, there will be more demand the food banks will have to respond to on top of that extraordinary level of need that they're already facing,\" he said.</p>   <p>At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which employs thousands of people at its Atlanta campus, the shutdown also comes at an already taxing time.</p>   \n   <p>The Trump Administration has already slashed CDC jobs and programs. This summer, a shooter who law enforcement says harbored conspiracies about vaccines, fired hundreds of  rounds at CDC buildings.</p>   <p>Now thousands more employees are furloughed and President Trump has threatened mass layoffs during the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"It feels like there's malice, versus what it was like back in 2018, 2019,\" said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the union chapter that represents several thousand CDC employees.</p>   <p>\"Now we feel like whatever is happening is meant to intentionally clear out and cull the herd, so to speak.\"</p>   \n   <h3>How shutdown impacts couple ripple across one state</h3>   <p>Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on.</p>   <p>\"Very few things in this world have to be done on time,\" said Ben Parker, the national affairs coordinator at the Georgia Farm Bureau. \"Planting and harvesting are two of them.\"</p>   <p>And Parker said the standstill in Congress is also distracting lawmakers from efforts to pass a Farm Bill.</p>   <p>\"At the end of the day, I can only speak for agriculture,\" Parker said. \"It's better for us if we can move past a shutdown because shutdowns don't help farmers.\"</p>   <p>At the 7,000-acre Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, Brittany Jones, who directs the nonprofit Chattahoochee National Park Conservancy, is also worried about potential lasting consequences of a lengthy shutdown.</p>   <p>\"I had C-SPAN on and it was a long sleepless night,\" Jones said on the morning after the funding lapsed. She was waiting to see if she would need to cancel several fourth grade field trips to the park scheduled for this week.</p>   <p>\"We're gonna have to unfortunately disappoint all those kids that were excited to come to their national park,\" Jones said. \"That was a hard one this morning.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

Jones said she's proud the conservancy can step up during a moment of need.</p>   <p>\"But we also don't want to set a precedent for stepping in too deep,\" she said. \"And when the government comes back online, then there's an assumption that we can take on more roles, when the reality is that our mission is to enhance the park, not run the park.\"</p>   <p>Jones is worried that shutdown could permanently reshape that relationship.</p>   <h3>Who is responsible for the government shutdown?</h3>   <p>Eighty three year-old Mary Keesee comes to this park often.</p>   \n   <p>\"On a warm day, you'll see the cormorants in the trees with their wings out, and I think that will be so great to see,\" she said. \"That's on my bucket list for the fall.\"</p>   <p>Keesee said she is not sure who is responsible for the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"I just heard something from one of the walkers that the Democrats want to give free health insurance, but I wasn't sure to who,\" she said.</p>   <p>Keesee is referring to false claims Republicans have made about Democrats wanting to provide subsidies to undocumented immigrants.</p>   \n   <p>Democrats are holding out for a deal to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>extend subsidies</u></a> for health insurance plans offered under the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire soon. Without the subsidies, many policyholders could see their premiums increase significantly – and some may no longer be able to afford the coverage.</p>   <p>Republicans also argue the subsidies, which were created during the pandemic, are too expensive. A few want to work with Democrats to preserve them.</p>   <p>Lauren Colbert, executive director of the advocacy group Georgians for a Healthy Future, said enrollment on the insurance policy marketplace created through the ACA has tripled in Georgia since the subsidies were passed in 2020.</p>   <p>At a trailhead, Stephen and Amantha Moore were unloading a picnic cooler from their rental car. They had just arrived in Georgia from Massachusetts.</p>   <p>\"My retirement goal is to visit every park managed by the Park Service, so this is day two of a trip that appears like it's not going to go as planned,\" Moore said.</p>   <p>As they unfurled a big road map and flipped through a detailed itinerary honed over months, they explained how they thought about the shutdown.</p>   \n   <p>\"I respect the Democrats for taking a stand, finally,\" Amantha Moore said.</p>   <p>Stephen Moore said Democrats should hold the line, but for how long – he is not sure.</p>   <p>\"One of our sons worked for the National Park Service during that long period when the government shut down and there were people in dire straits,\" Amantha Moore said.</p>   <p>But she said she struggles to square the tradeoff between fighting for the health subsidies and a shutdown that is forcing many federal workers to go without pay.</p>   \n   <h3>How the shutdown could shape the midterms</h3>   <p>This purple stretch of Atlanta suburbs will be a key battleground in next year's midterms, when Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is up for reelection. He voted against the Republican stop-gap bill.</p>   <p>J.D. Rhine has supported candidates from both parties but is not able to point a finger for the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"I try to listen to media that represents the Republicans and Democrats and weigh what I hear from both of those, and I can't come to any conclusion,\" Rhine said.</p>   <p>But finishing lunch on the main street in nearby Roswell, Reg Hunter does not hesitate to blame Democrats for the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"Now Ossoff himself, I've heard him talk and he seems like a fairly reasonable guy,\" he said.</p>   <p>Hunter's lunch companion, Thomas Nelson, said he's not sure if the shutdown will affect his vote.</p>   <p>\"Maybe depending on how people act, and how it gets resolved, how long it lasts,\" Nelson said. \"I don't spend a lot of time worrying about it. I think more about my kids and grandkids.\"</p>   <p>Though for many people that could change the longer the shut down wears on.<br /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Scott Detrow talks with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on his Democratic Party's strategy to resolve the government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> It is day two of the federal government shutdown, and so far, there is no clear end in sight. Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse. President Trump is leaning into blaming Democrats with threats to permanently cut thousands of federal jobs and a promise to cut what he called, quote, \"Democrat agencies\" in government. Democrats say that Republicans could have avoided this as they controlled the White House and both houses in Congress. They continue to insist on Republican concessions on health care, including extension tax credits for Affordable Care Act insurance plans. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries joins me now. He is a Democrat from New York. Leader Jeffries, thanks for being with us.</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Great to be with you.</p><p>DETROW: I want to start with this. Earlier today, President Trump called the shutdown, quote, \"an unprecedented opportunity\" to achieve his agenda. He has frozen tens of billions of dollars in funds for Democratic-run states, including New York. He's eyeing major cuts to federal agencies. I want to play a moment from Vice President Vance speaking yesterday at the White House.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JD VANCE: We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues. We don't like that. We don't necessarily want to do it, but we're going to do what we have to to keep the American people's essential services continuing to run.</p><p>DETROW: I want to start with this. Has this shutdown handed more power to the Trump administration?</p><p>JEFFRIES: No. The Trump administration has been out of control since day one. They've been laying people off since day one. They've been firing federal employees since day one, and they've been violating the law since day one. It's unfortunate that we now find ourselves in this Trump Republican shutdown because they don't want to provide health care to working-class Americans. Democrats are ready to sit down, have a conversation, find a bipartisan solution moving forward, reopen the government, but we have to protect the health care of the American people.</p><p>DETROW: But wasn't that a big reason why you and other leaders did not move forward with possibly causing a shutdown in March? I mean, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said it plainly, he was worried a government shutdown then would give the administration permission to wreak havoc on agencies. What was the change in thinking?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, House Democrats, myself included, strongly opposed the partisan continuing resolution in March because of the fact that it did substantive damage to everyday Americans. It hurt seniors. It hurt veterans. It hurt children. It hurt families. It hurt affordable care, and it hurt housing programs that people desperately need in this high cost of living environment. That's why we opposed it in March. And this bill is just a continuation of that on top of the Republican health care crisis.</p><p>DETROW: I guess my question is, if these mass layoffs go forward, what would you tell a federal employee who says, you know, I lost my job, and I feel like it's because Democrats forced this shutdown?</p><p>JEFFRIES: What's clear is that the American people know who shut the government down, and it's Donald Trump and Republicans. That's clear to the American people because Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. And Republicans - the Trump administration - have been engaging in mass firings since the beginning of Donald Trump's presidency, and that's outside of the context of a government shutdown. This would just be a pretense that Republicans would use to do what they were otherwise going to do anyway.</p><p>DETROW: It's happening regardless in your mind. I want to ask you about another Democrat's point of view. Yesterday, I interviewed Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. She's one of three Democrats who broke ranks with the party and voted in favor of the Republican funding bill. I asked her why. Here's what she said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: I think it's important for us to really work in a bipartisan way to solve problems, including addressing this looming health care crisis that we have. I see it in Nevada when I'm home. And we should be working together to solve those problems. We don't need to shut down the government to do that.</p><p>DETROW: What's your response to that? I know there's some differences of opinion within a Democratic caucus here on the path forward.</p><p>JEFFRIES: The overwhelming majority of Democrats are standing firm because we recognize that the health care crisis is not looming, it is upon us. Republicans have already enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. That was part of their one big, ugly bill. Hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics are closing because of Republican malignant action all across America. They are setting in motion a possible $536 billion cut to Medicare at the end of this year because of what they did in the one big, ugly bill. And we know that as a result of their refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, more than 20 million working-class Americans are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, copays and deductibles, whereas in the Trump economy, the cost of living is already too high.</p><p>DETROW: How much...</p><p>JEFFRIES: That's why there's urgency to this fight right now.</p><p>DETROW: How much would these subsidies fix those broader problems, though? And they already exist, and people are already having a hard time paying for health care.</p><p>JEFFRIES: We're talking about 20 million Americans whose premiums, copays and deductibles are about to skyrocket. And beyond that, you certainly are correct. There's a Republican health care crisis. We have to fix our broken health care system. We have to lower the high cost of living. These are things that need to happen, and the moment is now to begin to work on these matters urgently. That's what we said in that White House meeting to Donald Trump, to Mike Johnson and to John Thune. This is a matter that requires urgent attention. Johnson claimed that health care is extraneous. Health care is not extraneous. It's central to the well-being of everyday Americans.</p><p>DETROW: There's some action on the other side of the Capitol from you. There's a small bipartisan group of Senate lawmakers who are trying to come up with some sort of compromise about having that conversation about health care but giving (ph) the government up and running again. Is that action that you take seriously? Are those talks that you're closely watching?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, dialogue is important in terms of what's happening. Over on the Senate side, I defer to Leader Schumer as it relates to those conversations. We need to cancel the cuts, lower the costs and save health care.</p><p>DETROW: I want to ask you about the messaging battle, which, as you know, is really important to a shutdown. It usually decides how it ends. A lot of our reporters across the country are hearing that aspects of Republican messaging are getting through, including this false claim that undocumented immigrants would get health care coverage. That's something we are hearing a lot in our interviews. It's showing up in polling. Are you worried Democrats are losing that messaging battle?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Of course we're not losing that messaging battle. And the reason why we know we're not, one, they're lying, and they're lying because they're losing. There's nothing that Democrats have suggested in any way, shape or form that is designed to provide health care to undocumented immigrants. The law prohibits taxpayer dollars from being spent in terms of Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And we know the American people aren't buying it because the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it was Donald Trump and Republicans who shut down the government, and they're being blamed for that malignant action.</p><p>DETROW: Curious what your plan is through the weekend, for the coming days. Are you having direct conversations with the White House? What comes next?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Since the White House meeting that took place on Friday, it's been radio silent. We haven't heard a word from them because they wanted to shut down the government, but now they're going to bear the consequences of doing that. I'm here in the Capitol. We're ready. We're willing. We're able to sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace, here at the Capitol or back at the White House to fund the government, reopen the government, make sure that we pass a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people, while at the same time, decisively address the Republican health care crisis.</p><p>DETROW: We've got about 30 seconds left. The last shutdown lasted 35 days. Can your caucus hold together for 35-plus days? Is this a long-haul situation in your mind?</p><p>JEFFRIES: We need to get this matter resolved sooner rather than later. That's why I'm here in Washington and will continue to be here to meet with anyone at any time and at any place to get this issue resolved.</p><p>DETROW: That is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Thank you much.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Voters in critical swing areas of Georgia are preparing to weather the consequences of a federal shutdown and question which party is responsible.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> The federal government is closed for a second day. With park visitor centers locked and many federal employees furloughed, Republicans and Democrats say voters should hold the other side responsible for the fallout. But as NPR's Sam Gringlas reports from Georgia, some people are focused less on who is to blame than on how long the shutdown will last.</p><p>SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: The last shutdown dragged on for 35 days. Among the hardest hit were TSA employees at Atlanta's humongous airport, who had to keep working without pay.</p><p>KYLE WADE: So we did mass distributions of food, and there were hundreds of cars in line of people who needed help.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Atlanta Community Food Bank President Kyle Wade says it's not clear if his organization will be looking at a small uptick or something more catastrophic.</p><p>WADE: Nonetheless, there will be more demand that food banks will have to respond to on top of that extraordinary level of need that they're already facing.</p><p>GRINGLAS: At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which employs thousands in Metro Atlanta, the shutdown also comes at an already taxing time. The Trump administration has spent months slashing CDC jobs and programs. Now thousands more employees are furloughed, and President Trump has threatened mass layoffs during the shutdown.</p><p>YOLANDA JACOBS: It feels like there's malice versus what it was like back in 2018, 2019.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Yolanda Jacobs is president of the union that represents many CDC employees.</p><p>JACOBS: Now, we feel like whatever is happening is meant to intentionally clear out and cull the herd, so to speak.</p><p>GRINGLAS: At the 7,000-acre Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, conservancy director Brittany Jones is also worried about the long-term consequences of a shutdown.</p><p>BRITTANY JONES: I had C-SPAN on, and it was a long, sleepless night.</p><p>GRINGLAS: The morning after funding lapsed, I met Jones by some Adirondack chairs overlooking the river. Park rangers rushed to close up the 1920s visitor center. Jones just had to cancel fourth grade field trips scheduled this week.</p><p>JONES: We're anticipating we're going to have to unfortunately disappoint all those kids that were excited to come to their national park right now.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Only five park service employees will remain on duty. Jones says she's proud the conservancy can step up.</p><p>JONES: But we also don't want to set a precedent for stepping in too deep. Then there's an assumption that we can take on more roles when the reality is our mission is to enhance the park, not run the park.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Jones is worried the shutdown could permanently reshape the relationship. Mary Keesee comes to this park often.</p><p>MARY KEESEE: On a warm day, you'll see the cormorants with their wings out like that, and I think that'll be so great to see, so...</p><p>GRINGLAS: She says she's not sure who's responsible for the shutdown.</p><p>KEESEE: I just heard something from one of the walkers. It's that the Democrats want to give free health insurance, and I wasn't sure to who.</p><p>GRINGLAS: She's referring to Democrats holding out for a deal to extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have made misleading claims about undocumented immigrants getting them. At a trailhead, I found Stephen and Amantha Moore unloading a cooler from their rental car.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE: My retirement goal is to visit every park managed by the park service. So this is Day 2 of a trip that appears like it's not going to go as planned.</p><p>GRINGLAS: As they unfurled a big map of their itinerary, I asked the Moores how they saw the shutdown.</p><p>AMANTHA MOORE: I respect the Democrats for taking a stand finally.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Is there a limit to how long you think Democrats should hold the line?</p><p>S MOORE: I don't know how long. I mean, it could go on for months.</p><p>A MOORE: One of our sons worked for the National Park Service during that long period when the government shutdown, and there were people in dire straits.</p><p>GRINGLAS: So how do you kind of square those two things together?</p><p>A MOORE: Well, I can't, really.</p><p>GRINGLAS: This purple stretch of Atlanta suburbs will be a key battleground in next year's midterms when Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff is up for reelection. He voted against the Republican stopgap bill. Finishing lunch in a nearby town, Reg Hunter says he blames Democrats for the shutdown.</p><p>REG HUNTER: Ossoff himself, I've heard him talk, and he seems like a fairly reasonable guy.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Hunter's lunch companion, Thomas Nelson, says he's not sure if the shutdown will affect his vote.</p><p>THOMAS NELSON: Maybe depending on how people act, you know, and how it gets resolved. I don't really spend a whole lot of time worrying about that. I think more about my kids and grandkids.</p><p>GRINGLAS: Though for many people that could change the longer the shutdown wears on.

But the Trump administration is using the shutdown to take aim at the Democratic Party.</p>   <p>\"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,\" <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115304455138824245\" target=\"_blank\">Trump wrote on Truth Social</a>. He called on Republicans to use the shutdown to \"clear out dead wood\" and said billions of dollars can be saved \"by eliminating waste and fraud,\" though did not give any examples.</p>   \n   <p>While some call the Trump administration's threats a political \"bluff\" to force Democrats to come back to the negotiating table, Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, seems to be making good on that promise.</p>   <p>He announced Wednesday the cancellation of $8 billion in energy projects. He also promised to cancel $18 billion in infrastructure funding to New York City, targeting the home state of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>   <p>Vought has also warned that layoffs of federal workers would begin within days — though any reductions-in-force would have to come from agencies themselves and follow certain procedures. </p>   \n   <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters on Thursday that Vought has no other choice. He blamed Senate Democrats for forcing the administration's hand, and said Vought is following a directive from the president.</p>   <p>\"Russ has to sit down and decide because he's in charge of that office, which policies, personnel and which programs are essential and which are not. That is not a fun task. And he is not enjoying that responsibility,\" Johnson said. \"It could end today if the Senate Democrats would come to their senses ... if they don't ... it's going to get more and more painful.\"</p>   \n   <h3>Executive power in a shutdown</h3>   <p>The shutdown does not give Vought or the White House any extra powers, according to Bridget Dooling, a law professor at The Ohio State University who worked at OMB for over a decade.</p>   <p>She argues it's a clear misunderstanding of the differences between temporary lapses in appropriations, which is what a shutdown is, versus permanently laying off workers.</p>   <p>\"This is a bluff,\" she said. \"And this is the administration trying to use some leverage to basically force Democrats back to the table to negotiate, to get the government back open.\"</p>   <p>The White House says Democrats have left them no choice but to look for savings across the federal government. But they have not explained why permanent layoffs would be necessary and not just temporary furloughs.</p>   <p>And Vought's past statements and writings indicate he's less focused on working with Democrats and more focused on making the changes he's long advocated for.</p>   <h3>Vought has long advocated for strict cuts</h3>   <p>Vought was a key architect of the controversial Project 2025, a conservative playbook released in 2023 to guide a potential future Republican administration. Vought argued in it that the White House needed to take a more activist approach to cutting spending and overhauling the federal workforce.</p>   <p>Now, he's part of the administration, and working to carry out those goals.</p>   \n   <p>He said with Republicans in full control of the federal government, it was time to contain spending regardless of whether they had the support of Democrats.</p>   <p>\"The appropriations process has to be less bipartisan,\" Vought told reporters at a breakfast hosted this summer by the Christian Science Monitor.</p>   <p>On Tuesday, Vought told Fox Business that he saw the shutdown as an opportunity to carry out the administration's broader goals to overhaul the federal workforce.</p>   <p>\"Let it be said there are all manners of authorities to be able to keep this administration's policy agenda moving forward, and that includes reducing the size and scope of the federal government, and we will be looking for opportunities to do that,\" Vought said.</p>   \n   <p>Last week, he sent out <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\">a memo to federal agencies</a> telling them to prepare for large-scale firings of federal workers if the government shuts down.</p>   <p>The move outraged leading Democrats.</p>   <p>Jeffries said the threat would not bend Democrats into supporting Republican spending plans that they say hurts public health.</p>   <p>\"Listen Russ, you are a malignant political hack,\" Jeffries<a href=\"https://x.com/RepJeffries/status/1971041739948556371\" target=\"_blank\"> posted on X</a>. \"We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings.\"</p>   <p>Republican leaders in Congress claim Democrats have tied their hands and essentially handed over the power of the purse to the executive branch.</p>   <p>The government typically decides which employees are \"essential\" vs \"nonessential\" for a temporary shutdown. But in this case, the White House may be using that concept for permanent cuts.</p>   <h3>Hill Democrats say Vought is doing same thing he did before shutdown</h3>   <p>Most Democrats on Capitol Hill say Vought's actions are no different than what he has been doing since the start of the administration, and that's a key reason they're determined to push back.</p>   <p>\"This is increasing signs of our democracy evaporating before our eyes,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told NPR. He said a wind project was canceled in his home state and there is a legal battle over it.</p>   <p>Multiple Democrats say Vought and the president were determined to use the shutdown as a pretense for inflicting further pain on political opponents.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think everybody should be worried,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said about the news of Vought targeting blue states with cuts hours after the shutdown started. He said any deal to reopen the government would have to come with enforceable provisions that ensure money is distributed as specified in legislation. </p>   <p>\"For me the most important thing about this budget negotiation is getting the president to agree that a deal is a deal, because he's just acting like a king unilaterally — go after enemies, go after cities I don't like,\" Kaine said.</p>   \n   <p>Kaine noted that even before the shutdown the Trump administration canceled $40 million for an economic project in Norfolk, Va., and pulled back $400 million in public health money during an uptick in measles cases.</p>   <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., stressed that to reopen the government, he needs five more Democrats to vote with the GOP on a stopgap bill. Three senators — Democrats Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, plus Independent Angus King of Maine — backed the GOP bill this week.</p>   <p>After Cortez Masto broke with her Democratic colleagues, she explained in a statement that she is concerned about her home state and the economic impact on the tourism industry, military installations and more. </p>   <p>\"That's why I cannot support a costly shutdown that would hurt Nevada families and hand even more power to this reckless administration,\" she said.</p>   <p>When Vought <a href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838\" target=\"_blank\">posted on social media</a> a list of energy projects in blue states that he was cancelling, Nevada — home to two Democratic senators — was not on the list. It's unclear if Cortez Masto's vote for the GOP bill influenced that omission.</p>   <p>Senate Appropriations Committee chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, made it clear on Wednesday that she opposed Vought's unilateral cuts. Collins has stressed that she is focused on working out bipartisan agreements on individual spending bills.</p>   <p>Another GOP appropriator, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Vought wouldn't be making these cuts or announcing federal firings if there weren't a lapse in federal funding. Referring to OMB, Rounds said, \"When you shut down government, you provide them a perfect opportunity to have a reason to reduce costs on a permanent basis, and the executive branch is perfectly within their authority to do so, particularly when you have a government shutdown.\"</p>   <p>He said if Democrats want to make it more difficult for Vought to act, they need to vote for a short-term funding bill.</p>   \n   <p>But Democrat Murphy says the more Vought pushes the legal envelope, the more Democrats should fight back. </p>   <p>\"We would be suckers to sign onto a budget in which none of the funding ever gets spent in Democratic states and all the funding gets spent in Republican states. As they act more lawlessly, our spine should stiffen,\" Murphy said.</p>   <h3>Labor unions fight back</h3>   <p>Federal workers say the Trump administration has already exceeded its authority. On Tuesday, just hours before the shutdown, labor unions representing more than 800,000 federal employees sued Vought, along with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor, over what it called unlawful threats to dismantle essential federal services and functions provided by federal personnel.</p>   <p>\"It's an illegal abuse of power designed to punish patriotic civil servants and put pressure on Congress,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), said <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558084/federal-workers-union-leader-talks-about-the-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">in an NPR interview Wednesday morning</a>.</p>   <p>AFGE, along with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, argue the OMB memo takes the \"legally unsupportable position\" that the lapse in appropriations eliminates federal agencies' statutory requirements to carry out programs Congress had previously funded.</p>   <p>In their complaint, the unions allege the budget office's memo unlawfully directs agencies to disregard their own authorizing statutes.</p>   <p>The unions have asked the court to declare that both OMB and OPM have exceeded their statutory authority and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and to invalidate any actions that may come from the memos and guidance issued.</p>   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>NPR politics reporter Stephen Fowler contributed to this report.</em> </p>\n</div>",

She just liked to love on people,\" he says with a smile.</p>   <p>Marlanda was buried this past weekend, after someone shot into her car while she was driving last month. Vann says the bullet went in near one ear and out the other side. She was 47.</p>   <p>Vann says violence, particularly gun violence, happens almost daily in this neighborhood. Memphis has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country, according to FBI data – and although those numbers have been declining recently, Vann says it hasn't felt that way.</p>   \n   <p>\"They try to come up with a solution, but none of the solutions work,\" he says. \"I'm hoping this solution right here works.\"</p>   <p>Vann is talking about President Trump's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restoring-law-and-order-in-memphis/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>federal intervention to fight crime in Memphis</u></a>, which began <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557337/chicago-portland-memphis-national-guard\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this week</u></a> and is set to include more than a dozen federal policing agencies and the National Guard.

The Republican-dominated state legislature in Pierre knocked that down.</p>   <p>In July came the thunderbolt from Washington. It took out nearly a quarter of South Dakota Public Broadcasting's budget.</p>   <p>\"A lot of people really consider SDPB to kind of be the rock and [to] do the work — the important work — of making sure that all of our news in South Dakota doesn't eventually get piped in from someplace else,\" Overgaard says.</p>   <p>South Dakota Public Broadcasting officials had hoped they could appeal to the state's U.S. senators, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Mike Rounds, both Republicans who have appeared regularly on their shows.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Overgaard has been the executive director of South Dakota Public Broadcasting since 1997.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Julie Overgaard has been the executive director of South Dakota Public Broadcasting since 1997.\n                <b>\n                    Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Thune nonetheless moved Trump's rescission plan, which also included billions of dollars cut from foreign aid.

Details are scant: It's unclear when or how that money will be distributed.</p>   <p>South Dakota Public Broadcasting also highlights Native American issues, but executives say it doesn't qualify for that grant.</p>   <p>To make ends meet, it has slashed its newsroom to just four journalists from 11. It has dropped television news shows, educational initiatives and a daily, hourlong public affairs radio show called <em>In the Moment</em>.</p>   <p>\"This is our signature show, and it's crushing to not have it,\" says Cara Hetland, the director of radio and journalism content.</p>   <p>Much of the wrath from Trump and the Republican Party was directed at PBS and NPR, not local stations, for what conservatives contend is liberal bias — a charge the networks reject.

Repercussions have been equally stark around the country, though they have taken different forms.</p>   <p>There have been layoffs at public television and radio stations large and small, in markets including Melbourne, Fla., South Bend, Ind., Charlotte, N.C., Houston, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. In all, stations have laid off more than 400 employees, according to former NPR employee Alex Curley, who is tracking job cuts online. Classical music stations have been affected. So have those focused on news.</p>   <p>PBS has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5529431/pbs-cuts-15-of-jobs-in-wake-of-federal-funding-cut\" target=\"_blank\">laid off 15% of its workforce</a>. Penn State is closing the station it owns after the university's board rejected a plan to sell it to WHYY in Philadelphia.

In a hearing at a federal court in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, lawyers for NPR argued that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) had unlawfully <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/27/nx-s1-5554882/npr-federal-funds-decline-clashes-cpb\" target=\"_blank\">awarded a $57.9 million grant</a> to a consortium of other public media institutions to operate a satellite that helps power the public radio system.</p>   \n   <p>NPR has run the satellite for more than four decades; its executives say a top CPB executive told them in April that they would be given a three-year renewal, only to have that reversed days later after Trump publicly accused NPR and PBS of bias and called for all federal funding for them to cease.</p>   <p>NPR's lawyers are arguing on First Amendment grounds that CPB is wrongly yielding to Trump's order that the network receive no federal funds. CPB denies this.</p>   <h3>Trump supporters see benefits in local public media</h3>   <p>Public media executives said from the outset that if Congress killed subsidies, those stations that serve rural and tribal audiences would be hit the hardest — stations like South Dakota Public Broadcasting.</p>   <p>South Dakota is Trump country. And yet, like in many other rural regions, people here find that public media serves a need as other local news outlets are increasingly hard to come by.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/300/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 300w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 298px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(((100vw - 365px)/3) - 30px), (min-width: 768px) calc(((100vw - 30px)/3) - 30px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/300/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 300w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 298px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(((100vw - 365px)/3) - 30px), (min-width: 768px) calc(((100vw - 30px)/3) - 30px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg\" alt=\"Nat Van Gorkum, manager of a plumbing-supplies warehouse, says he opposes cutting money for public broadcasting and supports President Trump.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Nat Van Gorkum, manager of a plumbing-supplies warehouse, says he opposes cutting money for public broadcasting and supports President Trump.\n                <b>\n                    Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>\"Trump is vindictive, as we all know.

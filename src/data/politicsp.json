    "body": "\n      North Carolina Republicans plan to redraw their congressional districts to provide a boost for the GOP. It's the latest in a series of moves initiated by the White House.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The mid-decade redistricting battle between the two major political parties has now moved to the swing state of North Carolina. This is a battle President Trump is waging to help Republicans hold the U.S. House. And in North Carolina, GOP lawmakers are hoping to pick up one more congressional seat. The North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner is in Raleigh, and he joins us now with the latest. Hey, Adam.ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.KELLY: So give us a little primer. What's the plan in North Carolina?WAGNER: Sure. Republicans are targeting North Carolina's 1st Congressional District. That's represented by Don Davis, a moderate Democrat. It's also the only swing district in the state, and Davis has narrowly won it twice. The new map basically swaps a total of 10 counties between the 1st and the 3rd Districts, and if it goes into effect, Republicans would have a clear advantage in 11 of North Carolina's 14 congressional districts.KELLY: Eleven of the 14 seats - and I just called North Carolina a swing state. I mean, it basically is a swing state. That's pretty remarkable.WAGNER: It is, yeah. So this is a state that President Donald Trump has won three times, but at the same time, it elected Democratic governors all three times. And North Carolina's governor can't veto redistricting proposals. What's kind of striking about this particular one is how quickly it's moved. Republican leaders announced their plan last Monday, and it's moving through the legislature this week.KELLY: And Republican lawmakers, when you ask them what's the rationale, what do they tell you?WAGNER: They've been pretty clear. This is to help the GOP hold the House and to boost the Trump administration agenda. Here's Senate Republican leader Phil Berger answering questions on the Senate floor yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PHIL BERGER: The redrawing of District 1 was done based on a political calculation and a determination that that district could be redrawn for a Republican to have a better chance of winning. That's the only reason it was done.WAGNER: There's some thought that insisting that this gerrymandering is being done for partisan reasons is an attempt to get ahead of the lawsuits that everybody's expecting. Both state and federal courts have said that they can't overturn maps because they offer one party or the other an unfair advantage.KELLY: And what do Democrats say to all this, Adam?WAGNER: So all 20 Democratic members of the North Carolina Senate have formally protested the bill. And during debate yesterday, they argued that this new map splits up a bloc of Black voters in rural North Carolina. Here's Senator Kandie Smith. She represents the area around Greenville, North Carolina.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KANDIE SMITH: These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target. This bill and these maps are designed to fracture historic coalitions, diminish voter turnout and protect incumbents at the expense of the will of the people.WAGNER: The racial elements of this new map will likely be the crux of any lawsuit against it. Republicans are insisting that they didn't consider racial data when they were drawing this map. But the 1st District has elected Black lawmakers to Congress for 32 consecutive years, and the new map moves a significant proportion of Black voters out of that district. So right now, about 40% of voters in the 1st are Black. That's the highest of any congressional district in the state. And this new map would drop that to about 32%.KELLY: And just by way of backdrop, we're talking about the new map, but one thing that is striking is how many new maps North Carolina has had - how often the map has changed there over the last decade, right?WAGNER: Yeah. Redistricting is basically a near constant in North Carolina politics. Because of lawsuits and court orders, the map that's now under consideration would be the state's seventh congressional map since 2016...KELLY: Wow.WAGNER: ...And the fifth version this decade. And just to be clear, that's more maps than there have been elections. What's different here is that typically, state or federal courts have told the general assembly to draw a new map because of claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. But lawmakers are doing it this time on their own - they say to help Trump.KELLY: That is North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner. Thank you, Adam.WAGNER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

New York State Police say Christopher Moynihan was arrested after they were advised by the FBI that he had made \"threats to kill a member of Congress.\" Court documents show his arrest came after he allegedly texted that he planned to kill Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House.     Court records show that on or about October 17, Moynihan allegedly sent texts in which he threatened Jeffries' life, writing \"I will kill him for the future.\"   \n   \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live,\" one message reads, according to the criminal complaint. \"Even if I am hated he must be eliminated,\" reads another.   Moynihan, 34, was arraigned in local court in Clinton, N.Y. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\" He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.    He faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat.   In a statement Tuesday, Jeffries noted Moynihan was pardoned on Trump's first day in office.   \n   \"Since the blanket pardon that occurred earlier this year, many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned.\"   Moynihan was sentenced in 2023 to 21 months incarceration, 36 months supervised release. He received a full pardon, along with more than 1,500 other defendants who were charged with crimes related to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.    On that day, Moynihan can be heard on a video captured inside the Senate floor saying, \"There's got to be something we can use against these f***ing scumbags.''\"   \n   While many people had no record prior to committing crimes on Jan. 6, NPR identified dozens of defendants with prior convictions for crimes including rape, sexual abuse of a minor, domestic violence, manslaughter, production of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking. That includes Matthew Huttle, who was shot and killed by law enforcement during a traffic stop in Indiana days after receiving a pardon.   Moynihan's arrest comes amid rising threats to lawmakers. The Capitol Police told NPR in a statement in September that its agents were on track to work through roughly 14,000 threat assessment cases by the end of the year, a dramatic spike from case workloads in previous years.   NPR's Sam Gringlas contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      The idea of \"common sense\" has been central to American politics since the founding of the United States. Politicians still use the phrase all the time — perhaps none more so than Donald Trump.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The idea of common sense has been central to American politics since the founding of the U.S. Politicians still use the phrase all the time, perhaps none more so than Donald Trump. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben reports on how the phrase became one of the MAGA movement's central arguments.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: President Trump seems to frame nearly everything he believes as common sense, like his recommendation that pregnant women not take Tylenol.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There's something there. There's something going on, and we have to address it. And so I'm addressing it the best I can as a nondoctor, but I'm a man of common sense.KURTZLEBEN: Or when he cast doubt on the monthly jobs report talking to CNBC's Joe Kernen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: It's totally rigged. Smart people know it. People with common...JOE KERNEN: OK.TRUMP: ...Sense know it.KURTZLEBEN: The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown. Here's press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaking to NPR's Morning Edition recently.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean, continuing resolution to keep the government open.KURTZLEBEN: This isn't exactly new. Common sense is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an entire book on it. And when it comes to Trump...SOPHIA ROSENFELD: He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics, although, of course, it has a really old origin story.KURTZLEBEN: That goes back to Thomas Paine in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase.ROSENFELD: It invoked some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning.KURTZLEBEN: And Trump regularly invokes that. Here he was speaking to military leaders at Quantico last month, differentiating his administration from Joe Biden's.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: People that surrounded him, radical left lunatics, that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense.KURTZLEBEN: The phrase appeals more to several demographics that currently strongly align with Trump says Frank Luntz, a strategist who has worked with Republicans.FRANK LUNTZ: Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than in those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters. And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past.KURTZLEBEN: Which understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again. But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called common sense gun reform. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used the phrase this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Senator Bernie Sanders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt - common sense.KURTZLEBEN: One way to look at common sense is an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal. But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands.LUNTZ: For him, common sense has an even broader meaning. It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political, for being outside the mainstream.KURTZLEBEN: Rosenfeld has a similar take.ROSENFELD: It's also potentially rather demagogic. Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense.KURTZLEBEN: And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found. To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior, like a September social media post saying, quote, \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\" Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war. That's common sense.KURTZLEBEN: Common sense gives the impression of time-worn policy ideas, even if the policy - mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities - was previously unthinkable.Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Zohran Mamdani, age 34, is on track to topple Andrew Cuomo who's been Democratic Party royalty for decades. Analysts say Mamdani's hopeful appeals to young voters on social media shook up the race.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  One big question about the future of the Democratic Party comes down to age. A growing number of young Democrats, many of them left-leaning, are running for office, and they're hoping to topple a generation of older, more centrist Democrats. As NPR's Brian Mann reports, this generational battle is at the center of the race for New York City mayor.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Andrew Cuomo was Democratic Party royalty for decades. The son of party icon Mario Cuomo, he served in the Clinton administration before leading New York as the Democratic governor for a decade. Now 67, Cuomo says his deep resume makes him the perfect guy to lead New York City.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: This is no job for on-the-job training.MANN: Cuomo speaking there during last week's debate, where he described himself as a pro-business Democratic centrist. But he's running as an independent after being trounced in his party's primary by Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who serves in the state legislature.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes.MANN: Mamdani, a relative unknown until this year, celebrated his 34th birthday last weekend. Despite his relatively thin track record, he leads this race by double digits. Andres Bernal, a political analyst at the City University of New York, thinks Mamdani was smart to offer big, progressive ideas - like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service - that appeal to young voters.ANDRES BERNAL: Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and are - is associated with Mamdani's youth.MANN: The latest poll by the AARP and Gotham Polling shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76% of his support is over age 50. Bernal says one challenge for Cuomo is that he carries the kind of baggage - including a sexual misconduct scandal that forced him from office in 2021 - that many younger voters associate with the Democratic Party's older establishment.BERNAL: It's a revolving door with a lot of corporate America, with a lot of funders, lobbyists.MANN: But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and communication style. Here's how the two candidates answered when asked whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal shops.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: (Laughter) I have purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop.UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: OK. Mr. Cuomo?CUOMO: No.MANN: This difference in tone and attitude is playing out starkly in social media, where Mamdani's upbeat campaign videos often go viral.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He's building a movement that goes beyond what we just expect out of a regular politician.MANN: J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx, is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas, but he says Mamdani's social media outreach to young voters is a game-changer.JC POLANCO: Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate try to do. They're copying him. He has rewritten the book. I love his style. He's the happy warrior.MANN: During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging is getting better, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now. I think the assemblyman did do a better job on TikTok and social media than I did during the campaign.MANN: With voting underway, Election Day is just two weeks away. If he holds onto his lead, Mamdani will represent one more big generational change - serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but polls show most younger voters back Mamdani's position on the Gaza War and Palestinian rights.Brian Mann, NPR News, New York.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, had been scheduled to have his confirmation hearing this week.   On Monday, however, Politico reported on a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be \"tossed into the seventh circle of hell.\" Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having \"a Nazi streak\" at times.   After the texts came to light, several Republican senators said they would not support his nomination. They included some of the most conservative and stalwart Trump allies in the Senate.   \n   \"I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday's HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,\" Ingrassia posted in an online message. \"I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!\" HSGAC is the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs.   \n   Asked for comment on Ingrassia withdrawing his name from consideration, the White House said simply, \"He is no longer the nominee.\" But Ingrassia's post came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune had said he hoped the White House would withdraw Ingrassia's nomination and several GOP senators said they would not support him.   \"I'm a no,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the committee that would've taken up Ingrassia's nomination. \"It never should have got this far.\"   Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump's nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.   Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump's first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist's modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters.   \n   Last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.   But Democrats weren't satisfied with Ingrassia's withdrawal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling on the president to fire him from his current position as a White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security.   \"This isn't anywhere near enough,\" Schumer said on social media.   According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that \"MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his 'holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.\"   Politico spoke to Ingrassia's lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.   The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It's also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.   In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a \"highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n   This first appeared in the Planet Money newsletter. Sign up here!   A few years ago, Cory Doctorow coined a word that took the internet by storm. It appeared everywhere, including in our newsletter that analyzed why dating apps are breaking the hearts of their users. The American Dialect Society named it its word of the year in 2023. Merriam-Webster even added it to its dictionary — despite it having a swear word in it.   The word Doctorow coined is \"enshittification.\" And, naturally, that's also the title of his new book.   Enshittification is more than just a catchy word, describing when companies turn to crap. For Doctorow, a long-time internet activist and journalist, it describes a specific process he sees in the evolution — or, really, the devolution — of internet platforms, like Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon. (Disclosure: Google and Amazon are financial supporters of NPR and Amazon pays to distribute some of our programming.)   \n   The Stages Of Enshittification   In his new book, Doctorow argues there's a pattern in how these platforms operate. The companies behind these platforms are basically middlemen, connecting their users with businesses that want to make money from these users. So, for example, Facebook and Google connect their users with advertisers. Amazon connects its users with third-party merchants on its marketplace.   Stage 1 is when these platforms are new and want to entice users onto their platforms. They are flush with investor cash, face less pressure from shareholders to make immediate profits, and are in a race to convince people to sign up. This is when the platforms are really good to their users.   For example, in its early days, Facebook told users that they wouldn't spy on them and harvest their data the way they said MySpace did. And they offered \"a feed of things that users wanted to see, rather than things that businesses would pay to show them,\" Doctorow writes. For a while at least, Facebook was \"fun and useful and valuable.\"   Amazon and Uber offered consumers incredible deals during their stage 1. Like others before him, Doctorow alleges these deals were so good that they amounted to \"predatory pricing,\" or when companies charge below-cost, unsustainably low prices aimed at putting their competitors out of business.   \n   Stage 1 is all about achieving scale and locking in users. The platforms want to grow and benefit from what economists call \"network effects.\" That is, the more users they have, the more valuable their platform becomes. These platforms, Doctorow writes, also benefit from \"high switching costs,\" which mean that their users find it hard to leave and switch services.   With Facebook, for example, leaving the platform and going to another social network means trying to convince your friends and family they should leave and go somewhere else too. With Prime, Amazon gets consumers to pay for free shipping up front, incentivizing them to keep using their platform. And, if you've ever bought e-books or movies on their platform, you can't take them with you when you leave.   Stage 2: Being Good To Business Customers   After these platforms achieve scale and lock in a large user base, they enter stage 2. That's when the companies start trying to entice business customers onto their platform by being really good to them — at the expense of their users.   For Facebook, Doctorow writes, this meant changing the feeds that users saw. Facebook began using user data to target them with precise ads. Advertisers loved it. And they got publishers to publish short excerpts of their articles, and Facebook would \"nonconsensually cram those excerpts into the eyeballs of users who never asked to see them.\" This was a great deal for publishers, who became increasingly dependent on Facebook for traffic.   Likewise, Amazon provided a great deal to its business customers. \"Amazon paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers,\" Doctorow writes. \"It subsidized returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers' queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.\"   \n   With users and businesses locked in to their platforms, that tees up Stage 3, when the companies start trying to recoup their investor cash and actually start trying to make a lot of money.   Stage 3: When Everything Turns To Crap   Stage 3 is when these platforms tighten their grips on business customers, squeezing money out of them.   Facebook, Doctorow writes, began forcing advertisers to pay more for ad services and provided those advertisers with lower quality ad targeting. Wanting to keep internet traffic on their platform, they began forcing publishers to publish longer and longer excerpts of their articles in order to appear in user feeds. And they started charging them to \"boost\" their content in order for large numbers of users to see it, even when users had explicitly followed these publishers and signed up to see that content.   \"Meanwhile, for users, things kept getting even worse,\" Doctorow writes. They were fed an algorithm not of stuff they had signed up to see, but rather one filled with \"content people paid to put there: ads and boosted content.\"   We reached out to Facebook (Meta), and they didn't respond for comment.   Amazon, Doctorow writes, began using its data on merchants' sales to \"clone\" their products. He asserts Amazon began gaming their search algorithm to benefit themselves. And Doctorow asserts Amazon began charging merchants junk fees. \"Add all the junk fees together, and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45 to 51 cents on every dollar it earns on the platform,\" Doctorow claims. \"Even if a merchant wanted to absorb the 'Amazon tax' on your behalf, it couldn't. Merchants just don't make 51 percent margins.\" So the merchants have to increase their prices. (We reached out to Doctorow about where he got these numbers, and he cites this 2023 study from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit research and advocacy organization).   \n   Stage 3, he writes, is also worse for consumers in other ways, like search quality. \"On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29 percent more expensive than the best result for your search,\" Doctorow claims. \"Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen, and you'll pay an average of 25 percent more than you would for your best match. On average, the best match is located seventeen places down in an Amazon search result.\" (Doctorow cites this study and this study).   From the perspective of these platforms and their shareholders, you might call Stage 3 enrichification. But, for users and business customers, Doctorow writes, this is \"the end-stage of enshittification, the stage at which a platform turns into a pile of shit.\"   Naturally, we reached out to Amazon about Doctorow's arguments and claims. \"The book's entire theory about Amazon is incorrect,\" an Amazon spokesperson says. \"Even a cursory look would show that the value Amazon offers customers has only gotten better and better over time.\"   In regards to Doctorow's assertion that Amazon \"clones\" products of smaller businesses, the spokesperson responded, \"We follow the same practices as countless other retailers to inform our private brands, and we prohibit employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private-label products to launch.\" About search, they said they do not favor their own products in results. And they say it's \"categorically false\" that Amazon introduced \"junk fees.\" The spokesperson says Docotrow's figures are \"false and misleading because they conflate required selling fees with the cost of optional services — such as logistics, customer service, and advertising — that some sellers choose to purchase from Amazon or other providers. Amazon selling fees are 15% or less in most product categories.\" And, the spokesperson stressed, the extra fees are optional. \"Sellers who choose to purchase optional services from Amazon do so because Amazon provides more value than they can get elsewhere.\"   \n   Why Doctorow believes platforms degrade over time   Most of Doctorow's explanation for why internet platforms have gone down the toilet is hardly novel. While he offers some interesting technical nuances and solutions, his analysis largely comes down to two big factors: a lack of competition and an absence of the right, pro-consumer regulations.   Doctorow argues that these internet platforms have been treating their users and business customers like crap because they can treat them like crap. They can act this way because they don't fear their users will flee to competitors or that they'll be sanctioned much by the government.   Put another way, the castles of these companies' profit engines are protected by moats. Each moat is made of things like network effects and switching costs. Their customers either don't want to leave en masse or have a hard time escaping. And, at least until recently, the government has proven unwilling or unable to try and storm the castles.   To increase competition, Doctorow advocates for more vigorous antitrust enforcement and abandoning an influential legal doctrine known as \"the consumer welfare standard.\" This standard was adopted by the courts in the late 20th century. It judges whether companies are monopolies or anti-competitive not based on how big or powerful they are, but on whether they are measurably harming consumers, typically through demonstrably higher prices (We tell the origin story of this standard, and explore the new movement to change it in this Planet Money series about antitrust. Give it a listen).   When it comes to improving regulation, Doctorow offers a number of interesting ideas. One is, essentially, making it easier for users to leave platforms. For example, passing regulations that would allow Amazon Kindle users to take their e-books with them. He argues that this \"right-to-exit\" would be easy to administer. And it would create real incentives for platforms to be better to their users.   \n   Doctorow also spends a lot of time singing the praises of \"interoperability.\" It's a technical computer term that basically means allowing products or services to work with other products or services. One example is printer ink cartridges. In his ideal world, any competitor would be able to make ink cartridges that are compatible — or interoperable — with a given printer. However, in the existing system, makers of printers are able to make it so users must use only their special, very expensive ink cartridges in their printers. This exclusivity is obviously a money-making scheme.   The tech companies have made it so many of their products and services are not interoperable with each other. iPhones won't run Android apps. Bluesky users can't DM their old Twitter contacts. Doctorow suggests these are artificial barriers created by companies to maintain their market power, and that regulations have helped them do it.   And, yeah, lefty consumer advocates like Doctorow seem to be mostly losing in today's America. But he points out that the anti-tech monopoly movement has really gathered steam in recent years, including overseas. And he believes there are clear policy solutions that are popular, including with many conservatives, that can \"reverse the enshittification of the internet.\"   Reminder for those of you following along with Planet Money's Board Game project: We're going to have a live online chat you can join on 11/1 about the game, the process, and how it's going.

In April, 12 students at schools on military bases in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan claimed their First Amendment rights had been violated when nearly 600 books were removed from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools they attend. The students are the children of active duty service members ranging from pre-K to 11th grade.   The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the ACLU of Virginia filed a motion on behalf of the families requesting the return of \"all books and curriculum already quarantined or removed based on potential violation of the Executive Orders.\"   \n   Earlier this year, President Trump issued executive orders demanding federal agencies remove and prohibit any materials that promote \"gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\"   In January, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued the memoranda \"Restoring America's Fighting Force,\" which prohibited \"instruction on Critical Race Theory (CRT), DEI, or gender ideology,\" and \"Identity Months Dead at DoD,\" which barred using official resources for celebrations such as Black History Month, Women's History Month and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.   According to the plaintiffs, DoDEA officials sent emails directing teachers to remove books and cancel lesson plans and events that would be in violation of Trump's executive orders and Hegseth's guidance.   Books removed from school libraries at military bases covered such topics as sexual identity, racism and LGBTQ pride. You can see a list of the books here.   Two elementary schools cancelled Black History Month events, teachers at a middle school were told to remove posters of education activist Malala Yousafzai and painter Frida Kahlo and another school cancelled Holocaust Remembrance Day.   According to the motion filed by the ACLU, the students claimed that when they protested the school's actions, they were punished and became \"increasingly afraid to discuss race and gender in their classrooms, because they fear being silenced by teachers fearful of violating the EOs and DoDEA guidance.\"   \n   In her decision, U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles sided with the students and their families, writing that \"the removals were not rooted in pedagogical concerns\" but rather there was \"improper partisan motivation underlying [defendants'] actions.\" Giles wrote that DOD officials must \"immediately restore the books and curricular materials that have been removed.\"   The Department of Defense and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) have not yet responded to NPR's request for comment.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he believes public pressure will mount on Republicans in the coming days to extend health insurance subsidies that are the heart of the shutdown fight.   Most of the federal government remains shut down after Senate Republicans and Democrats again failed to pass a spending bill Monday that would reopen the government. Democrats, who have put forward their own spending resolution, remain steadfast that Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies used by more than 20 million people to afford monthly health premiums should be extended.   With the credits expiring at the end of the year and ACA open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, many buying insurance through their state's marketplace are likely to see their monthly costs soar.   \n   In an interview with Morning Edition, Jeffries said he believes \"it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\"   Some Republicans have proposed a one-year extension of the ACA subsidies, which Jeffries has opposed. In a separate interview with Morning Edition, GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Democrats knew the subsidies would expire and dared Jeffries to sign onto the one-year extension if he was \"serious\" about it.   \n   In response, Jeffries said that \"If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance … it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working class Americans,\" referring to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.   Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Jeffries discussed how the shutdown is playing out and why Democrats remain adamant on their position.   This interview has been edited for length and clarity.       Interview highlights   Michel Martin: Last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats.   \n   Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on Nov. 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak, indicating that their health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles are about to skyrocket double, triple — or in some cases, quadruple — at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues taken together need to be addressed at this moment without further delay.   Martin: So as you just pointed out, Nov. 1 is a crucial date because that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage, without the subsidies, those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from, will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then?   Jeffries: Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. The pressure is going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time, as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly in states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland. We now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well.   \n   Editor's note: About 90% of ACA premium tax credit recipients have annual incomes at or below $63,000, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.    \n   Martin: So yesterday you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something that President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid. And you feel that that's not right. There still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. What do you say to them?   Jeffries: I support the military being paid. We, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House, have introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Sen. Ron Johnson [R-Wisc.] apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from day one of this presidency and allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hard working federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal, it's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety. And we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith.\n",

Japan's parliament elected Takaichi on Tuesday, several weeks after she was chosen to lead the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has spent much of the last seven decades in power. The LDP is seen as shifting further to the right: It was only able to elect Takaichi by forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, after losing its longtime coalition partner earlier this month.   Takaichi, 64, is \"one of the most conservative people in Japan's conservative LDP,\" explains Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan.   \n   She has advocated for tougher immigration restrictions and embraced hawkish policies on China. She has drawn comparisons to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for whom she has frequently expressed her admiration and often wears blue suits in tribute.   But she also played drums in a band in college, cites Deep Purple and Iron Maiden as some of her favorite bands, once belted a rock anthem on national TV and appears to maintain a strong affinity for motorcycles and cars.   \"Those are part of the character that is promoted by her, that [she is] more than just the strong Iron Lady, but also somebody who can have some fun,\" Hall says.   Here's what else to know about Japan's new leader.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sanae Takaichi bows as she was elected Japan's new prime minister during a parliament session in Tokyo on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Eugene Hoshiko/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eugene Hoshiko/AP\n    \n\n   \n   1. She isn't from a political family   Takaichi was born and raised in the central Japanese prefecture of Nara. Her dad worked for an automotive firm, while her mom worked for the local police department.   \"Unlike most or many of the politicians in her party who became prime ministers, she came from rather modest means,\" Hall says. \"But she did study very hard when she was young, and she passed the entrance exams for some very elite private universities in Japan.\"   \n   But he said Takaichi's parents refused to pay for her tuition to an elite university, preferring that she attend a two-year college to save money and live closer to home. She ended up attending Kobe University, a prestigious national university, paying her own way through part-time jobs and making the six-hour round-trip commute from her parents' house.   In 1987, Takaichi moved to the U.S. to work as a congressional fellow in the office of Rep. Pat Schroeder, a Democrat from Colorado — despite her own conservative leanings, Hall notes. After returning to Japan, she was able to market herself as an expert in international politics and secure a job as a television presenter.   \"And from there, she segued away from being a TV personality into a politician, which is a common path in Japan,\" Hall says. \"If you're famous on TV, you have a pretty good chance of winning elections.\"   2. She's spent decades in politics    Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993, representing her hometown of Nara as an independent.   She joined the LDP three years later and went on to serve in a number of key government positions, including minister of economic security.   Notably, she served as the minister of international communications — which is responsible for telecommunications policy and broadcast media regulations — under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, from 2014 to 2017 and again from 2019 to 2020.   \n   \"She served in that, I think, longer than any other politician has ever served, because the Abe administration was a very long administration and he valued her competency,\" Hall says.   Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, before his assassination in 2022. He was known for his efforts to revitalize Japan's economy — nicknamed \"Abenomics\" — and rebuild its role on the global stage.   Takaichi \"definitely depicts herself as the successor to Abe's conservative legacy,\" Hall says, noting that she did get his endorsement in the party's 2021 leadership election.   \n   \"I'm not sure how close friends they were, but they definitely were on the same page ideologically when it came to issues like China and the revisionist view of World War II that many of the ultra-conservatives in Japan have,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Takaichi looks on as incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks to the media in Tokyo in 2012.\n                \n                    Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   3. Her views have caused controversy   Takaichi subscribes to modern monetary theory, \"which says that you can engage in deficit spending on important things like defense and other parts of the budget,\" Hall says.   While she is not as traditionally fiscally conservative as others in her party, he says, she is extremely conservative on social issues. For instance, she wants to create programs to promote having children and doesn't think women should be allowed to keep their maiden names after marriage (even though she has used hers in professional and public life).   \n   She also has what Hall describes as hardline views on Japan's WWII history. In remarks over the years, she has downplayed Japan's aggression during the war and criticized the war crimes trials that the Allies held afterward to convict Japan's wartime leaders.   Takaichi is also known to regularly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where the convicted war criminals are buried and glorified. But she noticeably abstained from visiting during last week's autumn festival, sending a ritual offering instead.   Takaichi has also courted controversy with her disdain for immigrants and even tourists, a rapidly growing industry in Japan. While campaigning, she cited unconfirmed reports of tourists kicking sacred deer in Nara Park, part of a larger criticism of tourism that many saw as xenophobic.   \"It also ties into a general dislike of foreign people and also immigrants who live in the country,\" Hall says.   She has advocated for an anti-espionage law, suggesting that Chinese residents of Japan could be potential spies for China's government. During her campaign, she called for restrictions on non-Japanese people buying property in Japan and a crackdown on illegal immigration.   \n   \"People who are very anti-immigration are sort of smiling on her becoming prime minister, expecting that she will do something about it,\" Hall says, adding he thinks that is unlikely because of pressure from Japanese businesses who rely on immigration in the face of significant labor shortages.   4. She's not necessarily a feminist    Takaichi holds a notable place in the history books as the first female prime minister of a country where women only held about 10% of seats in parliament as of 2024.   Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in terms of gender equality — the lowest of any Group of Seven nation — according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.   However, Takaichi appears unlikely to prioritize issues of gender equality. She has long advocated for traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage and supports male-only succession to the Japanese throne.   \n   \"This is not going to be a period when women's equality or other gender issues are aggressively advanced,\" Hall says. \"But there is, I guess, some benefit to having a woman as the leader of your country, to show … young women that in the future they could become prime minister, too.\"   Takaichi has spoken about women's rights, specifically advocating for the expansion of hospital services for women's health and opening up about her own struggles with menopause symptoms.   Takaichi has also spoken about her struggles to conceive; She has no biological children, but is a stepmother to three kids — and grandmother to four — from her husband's previous marriage. (She is married to former member of parliament and fellow LDP member Taku Yamamoto, who legally took her last name, a relative rarity in Japan.)   Takaichi had promised on the campaign trail to increase the number of women in her cabinet to \"Nordic levels,\" or closer to 50%. But in the hours after taking office, she appointed only two.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi poses with her new cabinet members at the prime minister's office in Tokyo on Tuesday. She appointed two female cabinet members, despite her campaign promises to elevate their representation to \"Nordic levels.\"\n                \n                    Kiyoshi Ota/Pool Bloomberg\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kiyoshi Ota/Pool Bloomberg\n    \n\n   \n   Hall says Takaichi has had to be more conservative than her male colleagues in order to take the helm of the party. While she and her role model Margaret Thatcher differ in their approaches to fiscal policy, he says both are conservative, hawkish and \"do not want to be seen as weak.\"   \n   \"She maybe, in a way, has modeled her rise on Margaret Thatcher by being this very strong figure, despite coming [up] in a party of very conservative men who generally do not promote women to the highest positions,\" he adds.   5. She appears friendly toward Trump   Takaichi has indicated a friendliness toward President Trump, who called her \"a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength\" in a social media post earlier this month congratulating her on her rise to party leadership and her expected ascension to prime minister.   She responded with a post of her own, writing in both English and Japanese that she is \"truly hoping to work together with President Trump to make our alliance even stronger & more prosperous, and to advance a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\"   \n   Hall says Trump likely has a good first impression of Takaichi already, because of her reputation as an \"anti-immigration, hard-line conservative who is a respecter of his late friend Shinzo Abe.\"   Abe was one of the first foreign leaders to cultivate a relationship with Trump during his first term. The two became friends as they bonded over wagyu beef burgers, sumo wrestling and golf.   Trump is expected to meet Takaichi on a visit to Japan later this month. Hall predicts she will follow the same playbook as her predecessors:   \"You be as nice as possible to the president, you show him the maximum respect, you do not have public disagreements with him,\" he says. \"And when you do disagree over policy, you do it in a very subtle way that doesn't seem like you're telling the president he's wrong.\"\n",

Today's top stories   Many federal workers expect not to get paid this Friday, marking the first full paycheck they will miss due to the government shutdown, which began three weeks ago. So far there has been limited economic fallout. But analysts say that the longer the shutdown continues, the bigger the dent it could leave.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune (R-SD) speaks to members of the press at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 20 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 By law, federal workers are supposed to receive back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has attempted to cast doubt on that, NPR's Scott Horsley tells Up First. That rhetoric could result in some federal workers pulling back their spending habits, which could impact some of the businesses that those workers frequent. The total price tag of the shutdown is unknown, but past ones show that it has been costly for the government and the broader economy. Horsley says if Congress doesn't resolve the government shutdown by the beginning of next month, the food stamp program, which helps feed millions of people, may not be able to provide benefits.   \n   Colombia announced yesterday that it will withdraw its ambassador to Washington. The country used to be the U.S.'s top ally in Latin America and a key partner in the war on drugs. But its relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated since President Trump started his second term. Colombia's decision to withdraw its ambassador comes after Trump threatened to cut U.S. aid to the country and intervene in Colombia to combat the flow of cocaine.    🎧 Colombia's President Gustavo Petro is a leftist who disagrees with Trump on almost every issue and isn't afraid to say so, says reporter John Otis. Over the weekend, Petro expressed support for the \"No Kings\" rallies in the U.S. and said yesterday that his country doesn't accept kings. Colombia receives around $230 million a year in U.S. aid. Otis says much of those funds go towards helping the Colombians fight the drug cartels.   French authorities are still searching for the culprits who stole millions of dollars' worth of jewels from the Louvre on Sunday. The heist showcased huge gaps in security at the museum. A recent French government report states that more than half of the rooms in some of the major wings of the museum have no video surveillance.    \n   🎧 Prosecutors say they are not ruling anything out as a possibility in finding who did this. Time is of the essence in the investigation as the thieves will likely dismantle the jewels, melt down the gold and sell the gems separately, says NPR's Eleanor Beardsley. If this happens, a part of French history and culture will be gone forever.➡️ This isn't the Louvre's first high-profile heist. Take a look at some earlier thefts in the museum's history.

That's why two major clinical trials in Europe that evaluated cannabis for low back pain caught the attention of those investigating the plant's potential for pain management. The first showcased that a blend of cannabis oil, containing the psychoactive compound THC, as well as CBD and other natural compounds in the plant, outperformed a placebo. The other trial compares the same proprietary cannabis elixir with opioids, revealing that patients who used the elixir experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects like constipation than when using painkillers.    ➡️ Medical cannabis proponents say that the drug's safety is a clear upside compared to opioids because it does not come with the same concerns regarding overdose and addiction.➡️ Currently, there is one cannabis-derived medication approved by the FDA, and it does not contain any THC. Though it isn't entirely clear, experts believe THC is one of the primary compounds responsible for reducing pain.➡️ While most Americans reside in states where marijuana is legal, there are significant concerns about the quality and consistency of cannabis products. If the FDA were to approve a cannabis product, it would give patients with chronic pain more confidence to use it.

Pickleball has rapidly gained popularity in the U.S. Nearly 20 million people have picked up their racket to play the sport. As more players join the courts, pickleball-related eye injuries, including lacerations around the eye, corneal abrasions and inflamed irises, have increased. A recently published JAMA Ophthalmology study estimates that the incidence of these injuries has gone up by an estimated 405 cases each year from 2021 to 2024.    🥽 The study's authors have called for developing standardized guidelines for eye protection, which has been found to reduce up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries.🥽 Wearing eye protection would require players to purchase another piece of equipment and bring it with them. There are currently many options on the market, which can make deciding what to buy daunting without standardized eye protection guidelines.🥽 One of the most common reasons some players don't wear protective eyewear is that they are not aware of the risks, says Dr. Daniel Henick, an ophthalmology resident at Yale School of Medicine. Henick says that posting guidance outside of courts could help reduce these injuries. Professional pickleball athletes could also set an example by wearing goggles.   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The first phase of  the Reefline project will be Leandro Ehrlich's \"Concrete Coral,\" an installation of 22 cars that will become covered by coral.\n                \n                    Courtesy of the Reefline\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Courtesy of the Reefline\n    \n\n   \n   The first phase of \"Reefline,\" an artificial reef off Miami Beach, begins this month.

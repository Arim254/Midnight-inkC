The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to study whether the department can withhold federal rural broadband funding from states with unfavorable AI laws.   \n   \"We have to be unified.,\" said Trump, \"China is unified because they have one vote, that's President Xi. He says do it, and that's the end of that.\"   Trump's AI advisor, venture capitalist David Sacks, said the administration will not push back on all state laws, \"Kid safety, we're going to protect. We're not pushing back on that, but we're going to push back on the most onerous examples of state regulations\"   The executive order is almost certain to be challenged in court and tech policy researchers say the Trump administration cannot restrict state regulation in this way without Congress passing a law. The order also directs Sacks to work with Congress to help draft legislation.   Trump's executive order drew criticism from some of his supporters, including organizations that are part of a bipartisan effort to pass laws protecting children from AI harms.   \"This is a huge lost opportunity by the Trump administration to lead the Republican Party into a broadly consultative process,\" said Michael Toscano, director of the Family First Technology Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies, a conservative think tank. \"It doesn't make sense for a populist movement to cut out the people on the most critical issue of our day. But nonetheless, that is what they are vigorously trying to do.\"   \n   \"Even if everything is overturned in the executive order, the chilling effect on states' willingness to protect their residents is going to be huge because they're all now going to fear getting attacked directly by the Trump administration,\" said Adam Billen, vice president of Encode, a nonprofit focused on child safety and threats posed by AI. \"That is the point of all of this - it is to create massive legal uncertainty and gray areas and give the companies the chance to do whatever they want.\"   Sacks can recommend some state laws, such as around child safety, to not be challenged if Congress does come up with a national policy for AI.   While Congress has stalled on passing AI regulation, dozens of states have passed laws related to AI, which include banning creating nonconsensual nude images using AI technology, mandating government agencies and businesses to disclose AI usage, requiring checks for algorithmic discrimination and protecting whistleblowers.   The Trump administration has pushed for less regulation of the AI industry, citing competitive pressure with China. But Trump has also recently allowed chipmaker Nvidia to sell its second-most advanced AI chips to China. Depending on the quantity, said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute who studies U.S.-China competition, the export could end up \"diluting what is our most significant advantage in the AI race.\"   Trump and some of his allies have attempted multiple times this year to halt state-level AI regulation. Earlier this month, GOP lawmakers tried and failed to insert AI preemption into the annual defense spending bill. An earlier version of the executive order signed Thursday leaked last month and sparked a round of opposition from across the political spectrum. In July, the Senate dropped an AI moratorium from the reconciliation bill it was debating.   While Democrats broadly support more AI regulation, the issue has divided Republicans. A faction of the party, including the president, welcome the support of tech billionaires, though others continue to view them with distrust.   \n   Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, an industry ally, introduced the failed AI moratorium during the reconciliation bill debate and stood next to Trump at a signing ceremony for the order on Thursday. After the effort to slip a similar measure in the defense spending bill failed last week, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri posted on X, \"This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT.\"   Many Republican governors are also opposed to the move. Earlier in the day, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox posted on X that he preferred an alternative executive order that did not include barring state laws. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI,\" he wrote.   \"An executive order doesn't/can't preempt state legislative action,\" posted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on X Monday in response to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the upcoming order, \"Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation.\" DeSantis has recently proposed a series of AI-related measures.   John Bergmayer, the legal director of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Knowledge, agreed. \"They're trying to find a way to bypass Congress with these various theories in the executive order. Legally, I don't think they work very well.\"   In a post on X on Tuesday, Sacks suggested that the federal government can override state AI laws because it has the power to regulate interstate commerce.   Bergmayer disagreed, \"States are, in fact, allowed to regulate interstate commerce. They do it all the time. And the Supreme Court just recently said it was fine.\"   Bergmayer cited a 2023 Supreme Court decision where the court supported California's power to regulate its pork industry even though the regulations affected farmers in other states.

Over the past three months, the U.S. has blown up more than 20 vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific that the administration says were running illicit narcotics. More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes.   The administration says it is taking action to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. It says the strikes are legal and are being conducted under the laws of war, and that President Trump ordered them under his Article II powers as commander-in-chief and in self-defense.   \n   Many legal experts, however, including former military lawyers, contend the strikes against the alleged civilian narcotraffickers are unlawful and amount to murder.   The vast gulf between those two legal views has left some members of the U.S. military in the lurch, worried about potential legal blowback for themselves for taking part in the campaign.   \"It's hard to be a soldier and make determinations in any situation, but it's especially hard in a situation like this — where most people don't see an imminent threat — to be sent to do something that you're really worried about, could I go to prison for this?\" said Steve Woolford, a resource counselor with Quaker House in North Carolina and the GI Rights Hotline.    \n   His organization — one of several that make up the GI Rights Hotline, which provides confidential counseling and information for members of the American military — has received calls from service members since the administration began blasting suspected narcotrafficking boats in September.   Quaker House has been contacted so far by two service members who Woolford said were \"very concerned\" about their own involvement in the campaign.   \"Their calls were both about the legality of what they were participating in and what that might mean for them in terms of being subject to punishment for doing something that they weren't supposed to do and were supposed to know better than to do,\" he said. \"Both of them also had moral concerns because they are people who are willing to be part of defense but they don't want to be part of doing something illegal, or I don't think they feel right killing people outside of the laws of war.\"   \n   Woolford, who is not an attorney, said in both instances the service members were put in touch with lawyers who could provide more guidance on the legal issues.   \"A lot more calls\"   Military personnel have also reached out to attorneys at the Orders Project, which is a nonpartisan group that serves as a reference for service members who have questions about lawful and unlawful orders.   \"We're receiving a lot more calls in the last three months than we did before,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a former military lawyer with the Orders Project.   He declined to provide numbers, but he said some of the individuals are staff officers with legal, intelligence or targeting expertise.   \n   \"What we're finding out is that they're being told that there are these political appointees who really want to be able to talk about this and ... say everybody in the military who looked at this said it was 'green light, A-OK, good to go,'\" said Rosenblatt, who is a former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps.   Pressure from above   When some of those career officers don't sign off, instead indicating 'non-concur,' they are coming under pressure from higher-ups, he said.   \"So much pressure, in some cases, that they're giving us a call to say, 'What are my options? I want to do the right thing but I also don't want to torpedo my career unnecessarily.'\"   The Orders Project's attorneys who speak with service members are not giving \"grand decrees\" about whether an order is lawful or unlawful, Rosenblatt said. Instead, the guidance they provide is focused on what's in the caller's best interest.   \n   \"Generically, the advice that we might give might vary from how you can document the pressure you are receiving, to what kind of questions you can ask or clarification you can seek,\" he added.   Rosenblatt said his group has received calls from at least one drone pilot, but both he and Woolford at Quaker House said generally the service members who are reaching out are not the people pulling the trigger. Instead, they say, the callers are more on the operational planning side.   \n   While the number of callers may not be large at this point, the fact that service members are reaching out at all reflects the confusion and worry some of them feel about what they are being ordered to do.   \n   Woolford said that many people have voiced a concern that any future consequences for service members should be based on the law but they worry it may end up being driven by politics instead.    \"And then it just becomes this complicated guessing game of who's going to be in charge and what are they going to say is right as opposed to maybe the more solid foundation of 'we have accepted rules we can just go by,'\" he said. \"So that's just a really hard thing for people in the military to try to be guessing.\"\n",

Trump discussed his administration's economic agenda and its efforts to lower the cost of living.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump spent the week making a bold case about a booming U.S. economy with even better times ahead, as his economic policies kick in. The problem for Trump is that polls show a wide swath of Americans aren't feeling that optimism yet — and in his initial attempts at addressing the cost of living, he called the affordability issue a Democratic \"hoax.\"   Hoping to tackle the messaging disconnect, the White House rolled out a $12 billion farmer aid package and sent Trump to Pennsylvania this week to make his case.   Trump has frequently shown himself a strong economic messenger — winning reelection in 2024 by lambasting Joe Biden's economy. But one year into his presidency, Trump is struggling to convince Americans that the economic pain they see in their cost-of-living expenses isn't real.   \n   In part, the president's whiplash messaging could stem from his struggle to portray his own economy as less than perfect.   \"You know, they always have a hoax. The new word is affordability. So they look at the camera and they say, 'this election is all about affordability,' \" he said Tuesday in Pennsylvania, referring to Democrats in the wake of the most recent November elections who won handily by focusing on kitchen table issues.   Out of touch   The dismissive tone goes beyond the president; last weekend, on CBS's Face the Nation, Margaret Brennan asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to respond to polls showing a majority of Americans think Trump makes prices and inflation seem better than they really are.   \"I think the president is frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on. This is polling of average Americans …average Americans are hearing about it from media coverage,\" he said.   By some metrics the economy isn't doing badly — the White House has been pointing to falling gas prices and the fact that wages have been outstripping inflation.   But that's likely falling on deaf ears, says Michael Strain, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. He added that President Biden tried the same thing.   \n   \"I think it is strange to see President Trump and before him President Biden try to engage in an argument with the American people about the American people's view of their economic circumstances,\" he said.   Even while some economic indicators look good, several others are inflicting pain on voters. For example, inflation is elevated — boosted by tariffs.   Amid all of this came more emphatic denials from Trump that anything is wrong. Asked by Politico's Dasha Burns in an interview this week what grade he would give his economy, he replied: \"A +++++ .\"   And that denial extends to how the administration talks about its policies. Whether it's talking about farm aid or grocery costs, the administration has been deeply reluctant to acknowledge that its trade policy has made life harder for many Americans.   Adding to the at-times tone-deaf messaging has been Trump's focus on multimillion-dollar White House renovations and a ballroom, a Cabinet featuring multiple billionaires and the president's regular weekend trips to his ritzy Mar-a-Lago club.   Who to blame   And when administration officials do acknowledge economic pain, they often pin the blame on Biden.   \"What we're not gonna do is say Americans don't know what they're feeling,\" Bessent said. \"We've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years.\"   That Biden-economy hangover is real, said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell this week.   \"We hear loud and clear how people are experiencing costs, really high costs. And a lot of that is not the current rate of inflation. A lot of that is just embedded higher cost due to higher inflation in 2022 and '23,\" he said.   Importantly, Powell wasn't blaming Biden for the inflation, which had complex causes. But no matter what, 11 months into the Trump administration, Americans may not want a scapegoat so much as a fix. And some obvious ways to address the affordability issue may be politically and ideologically off the table for Trump.   \n   Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, says the president could help by finding a way to mitigate the Obamacare premiums set to spike in the new year or by removing tariffs he implemented earlier this year.   \"Is there a way that a president could fix the affordability problem? And the answer in this case is definitely yes,\" he said.   But so far, the White House says it's sticking to their policies and banking on Americans' coming around.   \"As the President said, much work remains to fully put Biden's inflation crisis behind us, but the Administration's tax cuts, deregulation, energy abundance, historic drug pricing deals, and trade deals continue to pay off – as these policies did during President Trump's first term – with real wages increasing and growth rebounding,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told NPR.\n",

Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dissolved the House of Representatives after getting approval from King Maha Vajiralongkorn, whose endorsement became effective Friday with its publication in the Royal Gazette.   \n   Anutin had signaled the move with a Facebook post late Thursday saying: \"I'd like to return power to the people.\"   The election must be held 45 to 60 days after the royal endorsement, a period during which Anutin will head a caretaker government with limited powers that cannot approve a new budget.   The move comes at a tricky political moment, as Thailand is engaged in large-scale combat with Cambodia over a longstanding border dispute.   Anutin has only been prime minister since September   Anutin has been prime minister for just three months, succeeding Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who served only a year in office before losing office over a scandal that erupted out of a previous round of border tensions.   \n   Anutin won the September vote in Parliament with support from the main opposition People's Party in exchange for a promise to dissolve Parliament within four months and organize a referendum on the drafting of a new constitution by an elected constituent assembly.   The party, which runs on progressive platforms, has long sought changes to the constitution, imposed during a military government, saying they want to make it more democratic.   The issue of constitutional change appeared to trigger the dissolution, after the People's Party prepared to call a no-confidence vote Thursday. That threat came after lawmakers from Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party voted in favor of a bill to amend the constitution that the opposition party felt ran against the spirit of the agreement they had reached in September.   The People's Party holds the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives and is seen as the main challenger to Bhumjaithai. As news of the pending dissolution circulated late Thursday, its leaders said they hoped Anutin would still honor the agreement to arrange a constitutional referendum.   Anutin served in Paetongtarn's former government but resigned from his positions and withdrew his party from her coalition government as she faced controversy over a phone call with Cambodia's Senate President Hun Sen in June.   \n   Paetongtarn, daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was suspended from office ahead of the July fighting, after being found guilty of ethics violations over the politically compromising call.   Warring parties are waiting for calls with Trump   With Thailand now again engaged in heavy combat against Cambodia, Anutin has embraced an aggressive military posture to appeal to nationalistic public sentiment, and has said Thailand will keep fighting until its sovereignty and safety are guaranteed.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People prepare breakfast as they take refuge at Wat Chroy Neangoun's Buddhist pagoda in Siem Reap province, Cambodia Friday, Dec. 12, 2025, after fleeing from home following fighting between Thailand and Cambodia over territorial claims.\n                \n                    Heng Sinith/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heng Sinith/AP\n    \n\n   \n   After the five days of border fighting in July, U.S. President Donald Trump pushed the two countries to agree on a ceasefire by threatening to withhold trade privileges from them.   Trump has vowed again to make peace between them after widespread fighting flared up again this week. If he employs the cudgel of high tariffs on Thai exports should Thailand fail to comply with his peacemaking effort comply, it could cause serious damage to its already sluggish economy.   Trump said twice this week that he expects to speak by phone with the Thai and Cambodian leaders, expressing confidence that he would persuade them to stop the fighting.   Anutin on Friday confirmed that he is scheduled to speak with Trump on Friday night, saying he would brief him on the latest situation along the border.   As of Thursday, about two dozen people had been reported killed in this week's fighting, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced on both sides. The Thai military estimates that 165 Cambodian soldiers have been killed, though no number has been officially announced by Phnom Penh.   Thailand's leader may gain from hawkish posture   \"Anutin has capitalized on the renewed border tensions with Cambodia to portray himself as a leader willing to take a nationalist, hard-line stance in defending Thailand's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" commented Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at Thailand Future, a Bangkok-based think tank.   \n   \"This emerging narrative has, at least for now, eclipsed criticisms of his handling of the floods in Southern Thailand and muted scrutiny over lingering questions of his potential involvement with scam networks,\" said Napon, who is also a visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.   Purawich Watanasukh, a political scientist as Bangkok's Thammasat University said that the standing of Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party has slipped in recent weeks due to the southern flood crisis, which took more than 160 lives, and his government's mishandling of major scam scandals, which tainted some officials and figures in the Thai business community.   \"However, the recent clash between Thailand and Cambodia has provided Anutin with an opportunity to reframe himself as a defender of national sovereignty, potentially boosting his popularity, \" Purawich told The Associated Press in an email interview. \"Dissolving the House at this moment allows Bhumjaithai to capitalize on this shifting sentiment.\n",

This was despite months of pressure from President Trump.   \n\n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  For the first time, Republican state lawmakers have voted down President Trump's call for congressional redistricting. The vote happened in Indiana today. The state Senate there defeated a plan to redraw the voting map in a way that could have flipped two House seats that are now held by Democrats. This was despite months of pressure from Trump, who's been pushing Republican-led states to redistrict and help the party hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections. We're joined now by Ben Thorpe from WFYI at the Capitol building in Indianapolis. Hi, Ben.BEN THORPE, BYLINE: Hi.CHANG: OK, so tell us about the debate and the vote in the state Senate today.THORPE: So there have been months of pressure from Washington and back-and-forth over how the senators were going to vote. I think it's worth emphasizing that here in Indiana, they are overwhelmingly Republican. There were protesters against redistricting that you could hear from inside the Senate chamber today, and looming over everything was this pressure from the Trump administration. Here's one of the Republicans who opposed the new voting map, State Senator Spencer Deery.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPENCER DEERY: And as long as I have breath, I will use my voice to resist a federal government that attempts to bully, direct and control this state or any state. Giving the federal government more power is not conservative.THORPE: Opponents also noted that states usually redistrict early in the decade after the census comes in. Republicans just passed the current map in 2021. And Democrats - there are only 10 in the Senate - said the new map would have split up voters in Indianapolis in ways that would weaken the voting power of Black communities and could be illegal racial gerrymandering.CHANG: OK. And in the end, the vote was 31 against and 19 in favor - is that right?THORPE: That's correct.CHANG: So what was the case that Republicans in favor of redistricting making (ph)?THORPE: So Republicans in favor of this new map have pointed to Democratic states where they see gerrymandering taking place and have argued that Indiana has a responsibility to try an even the playing field for Republicans. Part of their concern has been that if Democrats are able to regain control of the House it's going to be a setback for the MAGA agenda and could lead to another impeachment effort against Trump. Here's Republican State Senator Mike Young.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE YOUNG: Only a handful of districts throughout the United States will determine who controls Congress, and we may or may not do our part today to keep our nation in the hands of Republicans.THORPE: So Republicans basically saw the two Democratic congressional seats in the state as something that they could redistrict to give Republicans that edge.CHANG: And what was President Trump doing specifically to try to push this redistricting through?THORPE: There was a lot of pressure. President Trump has been calling out Republican senators on social media, has threatened to support primary challenges against any lawmaker who is in support of this map. So it's been really tense. And then in recent weeks, several senators reported anonymous threats against them. Some said police had been called out to their homes with false reports of swatting attacks that could have been really dangerous.CHANG: Wow, OK. So then overall, where does Trump's redistricting push stand at this moment?THORPE: Republicans still have a few seats' lead in this nationwide redistricting race. They redistricted in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri. Democrats have only counted so far in California. But other Republican states - Kansas and Florida - have considered it, and we'll see if they're watching what happened here in Indiana today.CHANG: That is Ben Thorpe from WFYI. Thank you so much, Ben.THORPE: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF HI-TEK SONG, \"ALL I NEED IS YOU\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top stories   A federal judge freed Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention yesterday. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what Immigration and Customs Enforcement called an \"administrative error.\" He was eventually brought back and detained in the U.S. A federal judge ruled that the government failed to produce a lawful order for his removal from the U.S. This decision came just as lawmakers were questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about President Trump's compliance with court orders.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kilmar Abrego Garcia (R) and his wife Jennifer Vasquez look on as his supporters address the press as he arrives at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Baltimore, Maryland, on Aug. 25, 2025.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The White House says it will appeal this decision, according to NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Abrego Garcia's lawyers say the ruling is an extraordinary victory, not only for their client, but also for due process. Democrats invited family members of people who were deported or put in detention to the hearing as examples of the impact of immigration enforcement. Noem said she believes immigrants who entered the U.S. under former President Biden pose the biggest threat to national security. Noem's department is reopening the cases of refugees admitted under the Biden administration and is calling for a review of asylum applications.   \n   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Ukrainian people would need to speak through a referendum for his country to surrender territory, which the U.S. wants Ukraine to do as part of a peace deal with Russia. Zelenskyy and other Europeans are working to offer answers and alternatives to pressure from Trump's bid to end the war.    🎧 Zelenskyy is engaging with the Trump administration's most painful proposals to show that Ukraine is negotiating in good faith, NPR's Joanna Kakissis tells Up First. Giving up territory has been a red line for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy says he is examining the possibility of elections over the next 90 days or a referendum on giving up parts of eastern Ukraine to help end the war. Ukraine has not held elections because the country is under martial law due to the Russian invasion, and the constitution forbids elections during wartime, Kakissis says. Public opinion polls show that most Ukrainians think holding elections now is a terrible idea.   The Indiana Senate voted 31 to 19 yesterday against the congressional redistricting that the president called for to help Republicans win next year's midterm elections. The defeat comes in a state where 40 of the 50 members of the Senate are Republicans. It marks the first time members of Trump's own party voted against his redistricting campaign. The nationwide effort to reshape the midterm elections in the GOP's favor has succeeded in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina.    \n   🎧 Indiana State Sen. Spencer Deery said redistricting for political gain opposed his conservative values, and he would fight to prevent the federal government from bullying a state. Other state lawmakers said their constituents didn't want the new map. Ben Thorp of the NPR network station WFYI says Republicans still appear to have \"tilted a couple more seats their way than Democrats.\" Texas helped the GOP possibly win five more seats; Missouri and North Carolina's efforts created one more seat each. California Democrats have countered by tilting five seats their way. The question now is whether Republicans in other states will follow suit on Trump's wishes for redistricting, Thorp says.

Interior designer Vern Yip advises getting offline and finding design inspiration in the real world. In his latest book, Color Pattern Texture: The Foundation to Make Your Home Your Own, he encourages readers to take a more hands-on approach to build a room that not only looks good but also feels good.    🏡 Online decorating trends like peel-and-stick options may look good in photos, but won't match the feel of real materials. Consider using a great rug or similar option until you can afford a proper redo of the desired area.🏡 Need temporary pieces while you save? Try yard sales and thrift stores for secondhand items that may be less expensive and of higher quality.🏡 When looking for new colors for your walls, make sure to consider your skin tone. Sometimes the light that bounces off certain colors can result in a washed-out appearance.

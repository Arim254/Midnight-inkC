Conservative organization Turning Point USA's halftime program also featured country musicians Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett and Lee Brice.   It started with a guitar solo of the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" Gilbert performed first, playing the songs \"Real American\" and \"Dirt Road Anthem.\"   Kid Rock played last, with a performance that included his 1999 hit \"Bawitdaba\" and ended with a cover of \"'Til You Can't,\" a song made popular by country musician Cody Johnson.   \n   At the end there was a tribute to Charlie Kirk, showing photos and video of the late Turning Point founder.   The roughly 30 minute show lasted a few minutes into the third quarter of the Super Bowl game. More than 4 million people streamed it live on YouTube.   Turning Point's All American Halftime Show was announced after the NFL selected Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish, as the Super Bowl halftime headliner. Some conservatives lashed out at the Puerto Rican artist being chosen to headline the game, with some refusing to watch while incorrectly calling the singer a \"foreigner.\" Bad Bunny was born in Puerto Rico, which is a territory of the U.S.   President Trump on Sunday insulted the NFL's halftime show, writing on social media that it's \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! … Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.\"\n",

With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump said in a lengthy social media post, complaining that the United States would get nothing from the bridge and that Canada did not use U.S. steel to built it.   \n   The Gordie Howe International Bridge, named after a Canadian hockey star who played for the Detroit Red Wings for 25 seasons, had been expected to open in early 2026, according to information on the project's website. The project was negotiated by former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder — a Republican — and paid for by the Canadian government to help ease congestion over the existing Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor tunnel. Work has been underway since 2018.   It's unclear how Trump would seek to block the bridge from being opened, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment on more details. The Canadian Embassy in Washington also did not immediately return a request for comment.   Trump's threat comes as the relationship between the U.S. and Canada increasingly sours during the U.S. president's second term. The United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is up for review this year, and Trump has been taking a hard-line position ahead of those talks, including by issuing new tariff threats.   Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, meanwhile, has spoken out on the world stage against economic coercion by the United States.   Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said the Canadian-funded project is a \"huge boon\" to her state and its economic future. \"You'll be able to move cargo from Montreal to Miami without ever stopping at a street light,\" Slotkin told The Associated Press.   \n   \"So to shoot yourself in the foot and threaten the Gordie Howe Bridge means that this guy has completely lost the plot on what's good for us versus just what's spite against the Canadians,\" Slotkin said.   Michigan, a swing state that Trump carried in both 2016 and 2024, has so far largely avoided the brunt of his second-term crackdown, which has targeted blue states with aggressive immigration raids and cuts to federal funding for major infrastructure projects.   Trump and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have also maintained an unusually cordial relationship, with the president publicly praising her during an Oval Office appearance last April. The two also shared a hug last year ahead of Trump's announcement of a new fighter jet mission for an Air National Guard base in Michigan.   While Canada paid for the project, the bridge will be operated under a joint ownership agreement between Michigan and Canada, said Stacey LaRouche, press secretary to Whitmer.   \"This is the busiest trade crossing in North America,\" LaRouche said, saying the bridge was \"good for Michigan workers and it's good for Michigan's auto industry\" as well as being a good example of bipartisan and international cooperation.   \"It's going to open one way or another, and the governor looks forward to attending the ribbon-cutting,\" LaRouche said.   Rep. Shri Thanedar, the Democratic House representative of Detroit, said blocking the bridge would be \"crazy\" and said Trump's attacks on Canada weren't good for business or jobs. \"The bridge is going to help Michigan's economy. There's so much commerce between Michigan and Canada. They're one of our biggest partners,\" Thanedar said.   Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Ann Arbor brushed aside the president's threat, saying she's looking forward to the bridge's opening later in the spring. \"And I'll be there,\" Dingell said.   \"That bridge is the biggest crossing in this country on the northern border. It's jobs. It's about protecting our economy. It was built with union jobs on both sides,\" said Dingell. \"It's going to open. Canada is our ally.\"\n",

Those people include politicians, entrepreneurs, academics and entertainers. Maxwell's appearance before Congress comes after the Justice Department released what it says will be the last batch of documents related to Epstein. In a few moments, we'll ask Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi what he wants to know. Let's first get to the facts.MARTIN: NPR's Scott Neuman has been following all this, and he's with us now to tell us more. Scott, good morning.SCOTT NEUMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: Before we talk about Maxwell specifically, would you just tell us what we've learned from the publicly available documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein? So far, there was this huge sort of data dump of documents, and people have been combing through them.NEUMAN: Right. What we know is that a lot of powerful people appeared in these documents, but in many cases, it's Epstein and someone else making only casual reference to them. In other cases, it's more aspirational, with Epstein or someone else discussing a dinner or a meeting with an important person, but no clear indication whether the meeting ever took place. But there are definitely other cases where Epstein was involved in chatty and sometimes lurid email exchanges. I'll just throw out a few names here - billionaire Elon Musk, self-help guru Deepak Chopra, author and linguist Noam Chomsky, just to name a few. President Trump and former President Bill Clinton are both in the documents in what appears to be a summary of unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct.MARTIN: And it has to be said that simply appearing in the documents is not an indication of wrongdoing, for all the reasons you just cited.NEUMAN: Right.MARTIN: But say more about how Maxwell plays into all of this.NEUMAN: Well, in 2021, Maxwell was found guilty of sex crimes in connection with Epstein. She says she met Epstein in 1991. And despite her conviction four years ago, she's continued to deny any knowledge or involvement in Epstein's crimes, including those involving minors. But the Justice Department has described her as a partner in crime with Epstein. Prosecutors have said she helped Epstein recruit and groom girls for massages that often included or led to sexual abuse.MARTIN: And the Department of Justice interviewed Maxwell last year. Tell us more about that.NEUMAN: Right. After she was convicted, Maxwell was sent to a low-security federal prison in Florida to serve her time. But in July of last year, she got an unorthodox visit from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Blanche interviewed Maxwell in prison. And according to transcripts of their discussions, parts of which are redacted, Maxwell told Blanche that although she knew Donald Trump when he and Epstein were friends, that Trump never did anything illegal or received massages. Shortly after that, Maxwell was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison for women in Texas known as Club Fed. That sparked outrage from some in Congress, with top Democrats criticizing the transfer, saying Maxwell had gotten concierge-style treatment as part of a political deal with the White House.MARTIN: Well, remembering that Todd Blanche, in his previous life, was Donald Trump's personal attorney. So what do we expect Maxwell to say?NEUMAN: Not much, actually. Maybe nothing at all. She's challenging her conviction in court and isn't likely to say anything that would jeopardize her appeals. Some lawmakers would like to know the names of 25 men who Maxwell said in court papers entered into a secret settlement and were not part of the Epstein investigation, but she's expected to make liberal use of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. And again, this will all occur behind closed doors, and lawmakers will be questioning her over a video link.MARTIN: That is NPR's Scott Neuman. Scott, thank you.NEUMAN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Benefitting from Takaichi's popularity, the LDP won a two-thirds majority in the lower house, enough to override vetoes by the opposition-controlled upper house.   It would also allow the LDP to initiate amendments to Japan's pacifist constitution, which the party has sought to revise since its founding in 1955, and Takaichi said she would pave the way for an eventual referendum on the issue.   \n   It's the biggest majority any single Japanese party has won in the lower house in the post-war era. An unprecedented 90% of candidates fielded by the LDP won.   \n   Charismatic Japanese leaders, including Takaichi's mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have helped the LDP stage comebacks before.   It's a feature of Japan's politics, which RAND Corporation Japan expert Jeffrey Hornung says \"are always very personalistic. People always look to the leader, not so much the party.\"   Japan's Nikkei stock index jumped to a record high, bond yields went up, and Japan's currency the Yen initially went down, before reversing course later.   Questions and criticisms remain about how Takaichi will pay for these priorities, given that Japan's government debt is more than 200% of GDP.   But Takaichi apparently feels her mandate will empower her to sweep aside obstacles.   \"We have advocated policies facing significant opposition,\" Takaichi said at LDP headquarters, \"including a major shift in economic and fiscal policy, strengthening our security policy, and enhancing intelligence capabilities.\"   Takaichi's lopsided victory comes amid a general shift to the political right in Japan.   Following Takaichi's election as LDP president last year, the LDP's coalition partner of 26 years, the centrist Komeito Party, left the bloc. The LDP then joined a new coalition with the right-wing populist Japan Innovation Party.   \n   Komeito joined a new coalition called the Centrist Reform Alliance, which lost most of their seats in the snap election, prompting their leaders to resign.   Takaichi also restated at her press conference her intention to revise Japan's National Defense Strategy and related documents. She did not say what exactly she might change, but she has previously hinted that she could rework the country's longstanding policies not to possess, produce or share nuclear weapons.   \"This year marks 10 years since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe advocated a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Takaichi told the press conference. \"I aim to deepen this vision.\"   The first Trump administration adopted the concept of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific, envisioning like-minded nations upholding a rules-based international order against revisionist powers, implied to mean China.   Takaichi pledged to continue to use the Japan-U.S. alliance as the cornerstone of foreign policy, and plans to meet with President Trump next month.   Trump is scheduled to visit China in April. Takaichi, meanwhile, is at the center of a diplomatic stalemate with Beijing, over her comments that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan could trigger a Japanese military response.   The Trump administration emphasizes that its allies must bear a greater share of defense and other burdens.   And RAND's Jeffrey Hornung says Takaichi may be better positioned than her predecessors to deliver such results.   \"She can't say anymore, 'well, I can't do that because the opposition parties will turn it down.' I mean, she has the numbers to pass policies and do things.\"   Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report in Tokyo.\n",

I wouldn't like it, either. But I didn't see it.RASCOE: The end of the video included a clip with the faces of former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, superimposed on apes. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith asked Trump about the video while traveling to Florida on Air Force One this weekend, and she joins us now. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: The outrage over this video was intense and not just from the left, but from Republican lawmakers, several of whom called on Trump to apologize. Initially, the White House kind of brushed it off, called it fake outrage, but then blamed it on a staffer. What did Trump tell you about how this video was shared in the first place?KEITH: So the thing to know about President Trump is that very late at night, his Truth Social account regularly posts and amplifies a lot of videos and articles and posts from random accounts that validate his worldview. And he attempted to explain away this very problematic post by saying he looks at thousands of things and only looked at the beginning of this one. And the stuff he likes, he says he tells his aides to post, as happened in this case.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they'd look at the whole thing, but I guess somebody didn't, and they posted it. And we took it down, and we deleted it, you know?KEITH: It took 12 hours and a lot of calls from angry Republican lawmakers before the White House did take it down. The reporters on the plane Friday night pressed Trump repeatedly, and he said he doesn't need to apologize, didn't make a mistake, won't be firing anyone and is, quote, \"the least racist president you've had in a long time.\"RASCOE: And what was the gist of the first part of the video, the one that he says, you know, he only saw the beginning of, and he liked that part of it?KEITH: So it was promoting a conspiracy theory about election fraud in the 2020 election, the one President Trump lost, but is continuing now, more than five years later, to prove he somehow actually won. The video was focused on Michigan. Though when he was talking about it on Air Force One, he said he thought it was about Georgia. And last week, the administration was defending, sending the director of national intelligence to Georgia, to Fulton County, where the FBI was seizing ballots from the 2020 election. The president last week also called for nationalizing election administration, at least in some Democratic areas, which election administration is constitutionally required to be handled by the states, and state election officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, are expressing alarm about potential federal interference. So this is about way more than idle middle-of-the-night social media posts. It is a real test for Democratic guardrails.RASCOE: On another topic, a federal judge said on Friday that the Trump administration cannot stop funding for an enormous tunnel project between New York City and New Jersey. Now there's been reporting that Trump would be willing to release the funding if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer helped get New York City's main train station and an airport near Washington, D.C., named after Trump. What did the president have to say about this?KEITH: So, like, the president has put his name on a lot of things recently, including the Kennedy Center. But this story seemed almost too on the nose to be real. And yet, when asked about it, Trump didn't entirely dismiss it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Chuck Schumer suggested that to me about changing the name of Penn Station to Trump Station.KEITH: In a post on X, Schumer disputed Trump's account, saying, quote, \"absolute lie. He knows it. Everyone knows it.\" The official reason the White House said they put a hold on this funding was to make sure that contracts didn't include anything related to DEI. But it had all the trademarks of retribution for the Democratic congressional leaders who are both from New York. Trump didn't address the funding side of this in his remarks, only the naming. But in his post, Schumer said, only one man can restart the project, and he can restart it with a snap of his fingers, that meaning Trump.RASCOE: That's in NPR's senior White House correspondent, Tamara Keith. Thank you so much.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel talks to House Oversight Committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., about the deposition Jeffrey Epstein accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  We turn now to one of the Democrats who sits on the House Oversight Committee, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. Good morning, Congressman.RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Hey. Good morning, Leila.FADEL: So we just heard Ghislaine Maxwell is likely to make liberal use of the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer questions. Given that, what is the point of this deposition?KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, I think that she still needs to come before the committee and cooperate and basically, you know, answer questions about some very important outstanding issues such as, you know, who else abused victims as part of this child sex trafficking ring, which financial entities and private institutions knowingly participated, and which prosecutors or government officials, you know, knowingly looked the other way? And, you know, if she decides to invoke her Fifth Amendment right, that is her right, but it also raises the question about what additional facts she does not want to testify that could potentially implicate her in additional crimes.FADEL: Are those your main questions for Maxwell?KRISHNAMOORTHI: Yeah. But also, I think another big question is why is the Trump administration withholding millions of pages of other documents that could shed additional light on what has happened with regard to this child sex trafficking ring? In particular, I've been calling for the release of the financial records because, you know, that ultimately allows us to follow the money.FADEL: Now, ranking Oversight member Robert Garcia has said that Maxwell has received special treatment from the Justice Department. Do you agree with that, and do you expect to learn anything more today about her relationship with the Department of Justice under this administration?KRISHNAMOORTHI: I do agree with ranking member Garcia's assessment. She's in a low-security prison camp. They call it Club Fed. She's had unsupervised laptop access. She, you know, receives favorable treatment compared to others who might have been similarly convicted. And I'm concerned that it's part of some kind of understanding or deal with Donald Trump. And that's in part why I have also introduced a resolution that would call for denying any form of clemency or a pardon, which she seeks in return for what I fear is, you know, testimony that could be favorable to Trump or falsifying what she knows. She's a monster, and she should not be given any leniency whatsoever.FADEL: Now, your committee is scheduled to depose former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, later this month. Documents from the Justice Department show that Maxwell played a role in the launch of the Clinton Global Initiative. Will the committee ask Maxwell today about her relationship with the Clintons?KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think they will - she'll be asked about her relationship to them, but to numerous others, including Donald Trump, as well as, you know, other individuals that have, you know, featured prominently in the files. Just to kind of level set, you know, the reason why I think there's so much bipartisan support for pursuing this investigation is because there were more than a thousand victims of this child sex trafficking ring. Many of them have come to Capitol Hill. We've met with them for hours. Those then-girls have become middle-aged women now, and they've yet to receive any justice whatsoever. And I think that has kind of stiffened our resolve that we've got to get to the bottom of this, regardless of who it touches.FADEL: Who else do you want to see come before the committee?KRISHNAMOORTHI: I want to see Donald Trump come before the committee. I want to see him testify just as the Clintons are testifying. He needs to cooperate fully. So far, he has not. As I said, there are millions of pages of documents that he and the Justice Department have withheld from us, but he needs to appear before us as well, and I think that there are going to be increasing calls for him to testify, too.FADEL: I want to ask about the millions of documents that the Department of Justice has released, and you've called it an F-minus-minus-minus effort. NPR and others have reported that the DOJ left names of victims unredacted while hiding the names of some Epstein associates. How are you following up on that as a member of the Oversight Committee?KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, you know, the Oversight Committee, especially in the minority, were kind of identifying holes in the documents. Interestingly enough, one of the ways that we're able to identify holes is that other entities, such as the Epstein estate, have been even more forthcoming in producing documents. So to the extent that they're producing documents to us, and those same documents, which we know should be in the possession of the government, are not produced to us by the government. That's a way of indicating that there's a lot more documents that need to be produced.FADEL: That's Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. Thank you for your time, Congressman.KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you, Leila.FADEL: And we'll note that we've invited congressional Republicans and the Trump administration onto this program to talk about all this. The offer still stands.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Texas' U.S. Senate is grappling with how immigration enforcement should look like ahead of its primary elections.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Minnesota has been the focus of immigration enforcement in the last few weeks. But for decades, Texas has been the epicenter for how the country addresses immigration. And as Texas gears up for its primary elections in less than a month, the debate over what immigration enforcement should look like is playing out in a big way in Texas' U.S. Senate race. Blaise Gainey of The Texas Newsroom joins me now. Good morning.BLAISE GAINEY, BYLINE: Good morning. Glad to be here.RASCOE: So what are you seeing in Texas when it comes to political messaging on immigration enforcement?GAINEY: Yeah. Well, like most political messaging, parties tend to relay and repeat what they are hearing from the top. For instance, here, Governor Greg Abbott has recently called for the Trump administration to recalibrate things when it comes to enforcement. And what he means by that is the White House needs to make sure respect for ICE is reinstilled and for them to recalibrate, to make sure they can continue deportation efforts without intervention from citizens. The wording on that is really important because he didn't condemn their actions. Rather, he said they essentially need people to give them respect.This was carried into the race for Texas' U.S. Senate seat by incumbent Senator John Cornyn, who said he thinks it's a good idea to de-escalate, but then went on to say that American citizens should not continue to cross the line from peacefully protesting to interfering with law enforcement activity. So they haven't necessarily shifted their message, but more so made an adjustment to call for peace while deportation efforts continue. On the Democratic side of the Senate race, both Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and state Representative James Talarico have said they would abolish ICE if given the chance.RASCOE: And how are Texans responding to this adjustment?GAINEY: Yeah. Just last week, high school students across the state participated in a walkout over ICE's enforcement efforts. And there were also protests at the capitol building in Austin and other areas across the state. People are extremely upset and want to let it be known, and this is not fully a partisan issue. As we should remember, in 2024, Trump and the Republican Party as a whole got a lot of support from the Latino community for the promises they made on fixing the economy. Latinos say they haven't seen that and instead feel tricked by the fact deportation efforts haven't been solely centered on finding and removing hardened criminals.RASCOE: So how are Latino voters responding to what they're seeing on immigration enforcement right now?GAINEY: Yeah. I will say Latino voters are furious with the way immigration enforcement efforts have played out, not only in Minneapolis but around the country. I just spoke with Gloria Leal (ph), who lives in Austin, Texas.GLORIA LEAL: The recent issues with ICE enforcement and immigration laws throughout the country have, I believe, persuaded Latinos that Trump has gone too far in his immigration enforcement efforts.GAINEY: So as you can hear, it's having an impact. And as you see, they aren't forgetting the events that have taken place concerning ICE and Border Patrol over the past few years. And from everything I'm hearing, it doesn't seem like the Republican Party will have anything close to the support they had from Latinos last time around.RASCOE: Well, if Latinos aren't likely to vote for Republicans in large numbers, does a Democrat really have a chance against the Republican nominee in the Senate race? And which Democratic candidate is better positioned to pick up those voters?GAINEY: Listen. If I had a crystal ball, I promise I'd tell you exactly who, but it's up in the air right now. Both Democratic candidates, state Representative James Talarico and Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, have very similar wants and priorities if elected. For voters, what is separating them from one another is their demeanor. I spoke with Gabriel Rosales, the Texas League of United Latin American Citizens director, and he explained why he's backing Crockett.GABRIEL ROSALES: She's just got a very powerful mannerisms about her. She's no hold bars, and she gets in their face. I think we need people like that that are going to fight, right? They're going to fight for you. They're going to fight. They're not going to look at color or race or gender.GAINEY: And as a reminder, Texas is still a red state, and no Democrat has won a statewide seat in three decades. So it'll be an uphill battle for the party, but they believe right now the energy and engagement is at a higher level than in the past, which is giving them hope that they can break the Republican streak.RASCOE: That's Blaise Gainey of The Texas Newsroom. Thank you so much for joining us.GAINEY: Yeah. Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON — Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, declined to answer questions from House lawmakers in a deposition Monday, but indicated that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she was willing to testify that neither he nor former President Bill Clinton had done anything wrong in their connections with Epstein.   \n   The House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she's serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, but she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be self-incriminating. She's come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.   Amid a reckoning over Epstein's abuse that has spilled into the highest levels of businesses and governments around the globe, lawmakers are searching for anyone who was connected to Epstein and may have facilitated his abuse. So far, the revelations have shown how both Trump and Clinton spent time with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.   \n   Dressed in a brown, prison-issued shirt and sitting at a conference table with a bottle of water, Maxwell repeatedly said she was invoking \"my Fifth Amendment right to silence,\" video later released by the committee showed.   During the closed-door deposition, Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus said in a statement to the committee that \"Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump.\"   He added that both Trump and Clinton \"are innocent of any wrongdoing,\" but that \"Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.\"   Maxwell's appeal hits pushback   Democrats said that was a brazen effort by Maxwell to have Trump end her prison sentence.   \"It's very clear she's campaigning for clemency,\" said Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat.   Asked Monday about Maxwell's appeal, the White House pointed to previous remarks from the president that indicated the prospect of a pardon was not on his radar.   And other Republicans push backed to the notion quickly after Maxwell made the appeal.   \"NO CLEMENCY. You comply or face punishment,\" Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, wrote on social media. \"You deserve JUSTICE for what you did you monster.\"   \n   Maxwell has also been seeking to have her conviction overturned, arguing that she was wrongfully convicted. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal last year, but in December she requested that a federal judge in New York consider what her attorneys describe as \"substantial new evidence\" that her trial was spoiled by constitutional violations.   Maxwell's attorney cited that petition as he told lawmakers she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.   Family members of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken victims of Epstein, also released a letter to Maxwell making it clear they did not consider her \"a bystander\" to Epstein's abuse.   \n   \"You were a central, deliberate actor in a system built to find children, isolate them, groom them, and deliver them to abuse,\" Sky and Amanda Roberts wrote in the letter addressed to Maxwell.   Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two-days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.   The Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, had also subpoenaed her at the time, but her attorneys have consistently told the committee that she wouldn't answer questions. However, Comer came under pressure to hold the deposition as he pressed for the committee to enforce subpoenas on Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After Comer threatened them with contempt of Congress charges, they both agreed to sit for depositions later this month.   Comer has been haggling with the Clintons over whether that testimony should be held in a public hearing, but Comer reiterated Monday that he would insist on holding closed-door depositions and later releasing transcripts and video.   Lawmakers review unredacted files   Meanwhile, several lawmakers visited a Justice Department office in Washington Monday to look through unredacted versions of the files on Epstein that the department has released to comply with a law passed by Congress last year. As part of an arrangement with the Justice Department, lawmakers were given access to the over 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers. Lawmakers can only make handwritten notes, and their staff are not allowed in with them.   Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, spent several hours in the reading room Monday morning. He told reporters as he returned to the Capitol that even if all the House members who triggered the vote on releasing the files \"spent every waking hour over at the Department of Justice, it would still take us months to get through all of those documents.\"   \n   Democrats on Raskin's committee are looking ahead to a Wednesday hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, where they are expected to sharply question her on the publication of the Epstein files. The Justice Department failed to redact the personal information of many victims, including inadvertently releasing nude photos of them.   \"Over and over we begged them, please be careful, please be more careful,\" said Jennifer Freeman, an attorney representing survivors. \"The damage has already been done. It feels incompetent, it feels intimidating and it feels intentional.\"   Democrats also say the Justice Department redacted information that should have been made public, including information that could lead to scrutiny of Epstein's associates.   \n   Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the legislation to force the release of the files, said that after reviewing the unredacted versions for several hours, he had found the names of six men \"that are likely incriminated by their inclusion.\" He called on the Justice Department to pursue accountability for the men, but said he could potentially name them in a House floor speech, where his actions would be constitutionally protected from lawsuits.   Massie, along with California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, said they also came across a number of files that still had redactions. They said that was likely because the FBI had turned over redacted versions of the files to the Justice Department.   Khanna said \"it wasn't just Epstein and Maxwell\" who were involved in sexually abusing underage girls.   Release of the files has set in motion multiple political crises around the world, including in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer is clinging to his job after it was revealed his former ambassador to the U.S. had maintained close ties to Epstein. But Democratic lawmakers bemoaned that so far U.S. political figures seem to be escaping unscathed.   \n   \"I'm just afraid that the general worsening and degradation of American life has somehow conditioned people not to take this as seriously as we should be taking it,\" Raskin said.\n",

It is also not a new clinical practice guideline, but rather an articulation of the professional group's recommendations \"given the current state of the evidence and variability in legal and regulatory environments,\" it says.   Pressure that's working   That legal and regulatory environment is colored by 27 state bans and a White House aiming to end surgeries and all other types of gender-affirming care for minors across the country.   \n   A week into his second term, President Trump signed an executive order declaring: \"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"   In the months since, HHS released a report critical of the research that supports access to this care and warned state Medicaid directors to tread carefully. The Department of Justice announced subpoenas of some children's hospitals and threatened providers with prosecution.   \n   In December, federal health officials proposed a rule that would withhold all Medicare and Medicaid funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and teens. Even though it hasn't been finalized, the specter that it will be, along with a deluge of investigations by the HHS Inspector General, has been shuttering hospital gender clinics all over the country.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill, who has also been the acting director of the CDC since August, is sworn in by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June 2025.\n                \n                    Amy Rossetti/HHS via AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Amy Rossetti/HHS via AP\n    \n\n   \n   Also this week, a patient won $2 million in a malpractice lawsuit against her plastic surgeon and psychologist in New York state after she had a mastectomy, or \"top\" surgery, as a minor and came to regret it.   The combined threat of malpractice lawsuits, state bans and hospitals ending gender programs, means that the options for transgender teenagers seeking surgery are dwindling, which is the White House's stated goal.   \n   One 15-year-old transgender boy in California tells NPR his plan to have top surgery is on hold since Kaiser Permanente health system stopped providing gender-affirming surgery to youth. \"It's not easy to do it out of pocket,\" he says. NPR agreed not to name him because he fears for his safety.   He calls the new position from the plastic surgeons' group \"disappointing,\" and points out that the Trump administration also recently sent warning letters to the makers of binders, a type of compression top that people can wear to flatten their chest. They are often used by transgender teens who can't get or don't want surgery.   \"Which is crazy because it's not like a binder is permanent. You can take it off anytime you want,\" he says. \"I was going to ask, 'What do they want us to do?' But I think the answer is to detransition.\"   Surgery for teenagers   There's no clear count of how many transgender teenagers have gender-affirming surgery. The full statement from the ASPS \"recommends that surgeons delay gender-related breast/chest, genital, and facial surgery until a patient is at least 19 years old.\" Gender surgery on people under 18 is rare, and most of the surgeries performed are top surgery.   The ASPS tells NPR the group does not gather data on precisely how many are performed. One study of a database of surgical procedures found an average of 800 top surgeries per year in patients aged 18 and younger between 2016-2020. State-level gender affirming care bans proliferated beginning in 2022, and it is unclear how the bans have affected how many transgender minors get top surgery.   \n   Minors who are not transgender also have plastic surgery and face similar risks of complications and potential regret. In 2024, ASPS data shows that more than 9,000 girls aged 19 or younger had cosmetic breast surgery, and nearly 3,000 boys under age 19 had breast reduction surgery.   The ASPS position on breast augmentation for teenagers similarly recommends waiting until age 18 for surgery. \"While both position statements address surgery in adolescents, the ethical considerations are not the same,\" ASPS explained in an email to NPR. \"Cosmetic procedures are generally not dependent on future identity development or long-term psychological trajectories.\"   \n   When it comes to gender-affirming surgery for transgender youth, ASPS added, \"interventions are irreversible, expected benefits are uncertain, potential harms may be lifelong, and patients are minors with evolving preferences and identities who have been diagnosed with a condition of unknown stability.\"   Years of waiting   A mom in California told NPR this week that her child came out to her as transgender when he was 13. She asked that NPR not use her name because she fears for her family's safety. She says she was surprised and didn't know much about trans issues when her son came out. \"He got therapy. We got therapy. We reached out to different organizations, and over time, we've grown to understand better what it means.\"   She says he wanted top surgery. \"Like a lot of parents, the idea of doing this permanent surgery, even for us — we were really frightened to make the right decision, so we told him no,\" she says. \"And he tried, and we watched him trying, wearing binders and tape. After a while, it was just really hard to watch,\" she says. For transgender boys who bind their chests, \"it's very painful — physically painful — trying to get their bodies to fit in a way that they can go out and just have a normal day.\"   When her son turned 15, she and her husband finally agreed to look into top surgery.   \n   \"There are a lot of requirements — it's not something you just go in and get — there is therapy, multiple meetings with different doctors,\" she says. Their original surgery appointment was cancelled when the hospital got cold feet, so they had to scramble to get it rescheduled.   Her son is now 17, he had surgery two years ago, and she says he's really blossomed. \"My only regret is that we couldn't have done it sooner,\" she says. \"To think that other kids who might need this — there's so few kids that do need this — to think they have to just live in a shell and put their lives on pause is so unfair and makes me so angry and so sad.\"   \n   No sea change among other medical groups   In the wake of ASPS's position statement and the Trump administration's promotion of it, there have been conflicting reports about the American Medical Association's position, and whether medical groups, which have long supported gender-affirming care, were shifting that stance.   AMA told NPR in a statement: \"The AMA supports evidence-based treatment, including gender affirming care,\" and added that, based on available evidence, \"surgical interventions in minors should be generally deferred to adulthood.\" AMA says that's not a reversal or an endorsement of the plastic surgeon group's new position, it's a clarification of the group's existing position.   Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics sent NPR a statement that the group \"does not include a blanket recommendation for surgery for minors\" and that the decision should be left to doctors and patients and their families, not politicians.   \n   In fact, the ASPS recommendation to wait until age 19 for surgery aligns with the existing standards of care for transgender youth, which \"recommend that patients reach the age of adulthood, which may vary based on where that [transgender] person lives or is seeking care, to be a candidate for gender-affirming surgery.\"   When Kellan Baker of the LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project read the ASPS position, it struck him as nothing new. \"I'm looking at this and I'm like, 'OK, thank you for telling me that water is wet and the sky is blue,'\" he says.   Baker argues that it works to the Trump administration's advantage to frame this as a landmark shift of the medical community towards more restrictions, without acknowledging the political pressure that the Trump administration itself has been exerting to achieve such an outcome.\n",

Times Square's digital screens have nothing on the glaring warning signs for Republicans ahead of these upcoming midterm elections.   President Trump, his policies and actions are unpopular. The GOP continues to lose special elections. Republicans are retiring at faster rates than Democrats. And people are saying they'd rather Democrats control Congress.   At this point, all of it adds up to trouble for the party in power.   The state of play: Democrats' hopes for taking over the House are more likely by the day, while the Senate remains a longer shot.   \n   The House: All members of Congress face election every two years. Republicans currently have a 218-214 majority with three vacancies (one Democratic, two Republican). If the vacancies are filled by members of those same parties, which is likely, and you put redistricting battles to the side, Republicans can only afford to lose two seats to maintain their majority.   At this point, according to the Cook Political Report, there are 36 House seats that are either toss-ups or lean toward one party or the other. Of those, 18 are held by Republicans and 18 are Democratic seats. But zeroing in on the toss-ups alone, 14 are Republican, and only four are Democratic. And the political winds are blowing in Democrats' direction. Cook moved 18 seats in Democrats' direction a few weeks ago.   The Senate: Senators win six-year terms, and roughly one-third of the Senate is up every election cycle. Republicans currently maintain a three-seat net advantage, 53-47. (Two independents caucus with the Democrats.) But given Trump is president, and Vice President Vance would come in to break ties, Democrats need a net gain of four seats to take control.   This year, 35 Senate seats are up for grabs (22 Republican-held and 13 by Democrats). But the universe of competitive seats is actually much smaller — 25 seats are considered to be safely in the hands of the incumbent party (16 Republican, nine Democratic), according to Cook. That means only 10 seats are truly in play. Of those, six are held by Republicans, including Maine, North Carolina, Alaska, Ohio, Iowa and Texas. Four are Democratic: Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire and Minnesota.   \n   The fights for both chambers will be closely watched, but the House is still considered Democrats' best chance for control of one of the chambers of Congress.   The reasons for potential winds of change:   1. President Trump is unpopular.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump talks to reporters while aboard Air Force One on Friday en route to Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Almost nothing is a better predictor of electoral success in midterms than who's in power and how popular they are.   Historically, midterms are not good for the president's party. Since World War II, the president's party has lost an average of 27 seats in the House and four in the Senate.   \"Even if it's a Democrat or a Republican, whoever wins the presidency has a hard time with the midterms,\" Trump said in Iowa late last month. He added, \"It's crazy. You know, you'd think it would be like a 50-50 deal or something. It's like, for some reason — and this is Democrat, too — Democrat wins the presidency, for some reason, they lose the midterms.\"   It's even worse when a president is below 50% job approval, as Trump has been for a while. When that's the case, the president's party has lost an average of 32 seats in the House. (This is mainly a House phenomenon. Presidents' parties have lost on average four Senate seats, regardless of approval rating.)   \n   Redistricting and the rise in safe House seats, though, has lessened the likelihood of wave elections that would bring huge swings toward one party or the other.   Still, the popularity of the president is an important sign, and midterms are often referenda on the president's policies. Right now, Trump is under water, as evidenced by the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out last week.   It showed Trump with a 39% job approval rating. He's been under 40% in the poll since November. His policies on everything from immigration enforcement to tariffs and foreign policy are all unpopular.   \n   His voting coalition is fraying, too. Independents, voters under 30 and Latinos were key to Trump winning reelection in 2024. But they have slid away from him heavily. In the NPR poll, just 30% of independents and voters 18-29 approved of the job he's doing, along with just 38% of Latinos.   \n   For all of Trump's boasting, he is showing signs that he and the White House understand the vulnerable position he's in. He's changed his tone on immigration enforcement, for example, saying in an interview with NBC News that he's learned his administration can take a \"softer touch\" (though he blamed \"bad publicity\" rather than bad policy).   2. The economic outlook is bleak.   Americans continue to say the economy is their top concern.   In the NPR poll, 54% of respondents said Trump's top priority should be lowering prices. Immigration was a distant second at 22%, though it was No. 1 for Republicans.   Only 36% said they approved of Trump's handling of the economy, with a majority saying tariffs hurt the economy.   A Pew Research Center survey also out last week found 72% rated the economy as \"fair\" or \"poor.\"   A plurality — 38% — said they expect the economy to get worse in the next year, while just 31% said it will be better, and 30% said it would be about the same. Majorities in both parties said they're very concerned about the cost of health care and the price of food and consumer goods.   And, by a 52%-28% margin, respondents said Trump's policies have made things worse rather than better.   3. Democrats continue to overperform in special elections.    With a win for a state Senate seat in Texas on Jan. 31, Democrats racked up yet another special election victory.   Ordinarily, there wouldn't be that much attention on a state Senate race, but the eye-popping margin and the pattern of other Democratic overperformances in the past year made this one national news. Special elections can be good predictors of success or failure in the following midterm elections.   \n   In 2024, Trump won this Fort Worth, Texas-area seat by 17 points. But the Democratic candidate in this election won it by 14. That's a 31-point swing.   \n   Trump would rather it was ignored.   \"I'm not involved in that,\" he told reporters on Feb. 1. \"That's a local Texas race.\"   But Trump had given his \"Complete and Total Endorsement\" to the Republican in the race and put out three social media posts promoting her and urged Texans to get out and vote.   It's just the latest example of elections over the past year, from special elections to November's off-year results, where Democrats have racked up wins and overperformed, often by double-digits.   In fact, between House seats, the fall's gubernatorial races and this one, Democrats have overperformed 2024 margins by an average of almost 16 points.   As they might say in Texas, Republicans' House majority is tighter than a wet boot.   \n   4. Republicans are retiring at faster rates than Democrats.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks during a hearing with the House Committee on Homeland Security on Capitol Hill on Dec. 11, 2025. Greene has retired, leaving her seat open for a special election.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A whopping 51 members of the House so far have hung it up for this 2026 election cycle.   It's a record pace, and, right now, it's more Republicans calling it quits — 30 to 21.   \n   Lots of factors go into this, including mid-decade redistricting and the lack of appeal of serving in Washington when little gets done and acrimony is as high as it is.   But which party has more lawmakers who decide not to run for reelection is usually a pretty good indicator of which side is most concerned.   What's more, the rate of reelection is very high for incumbents. Part of that is high name identification. Part of that is built-in financial advantages. Part of that is just that people check the box more often for who they know.   When there are more open seats, especially in competitive places, parties and candidates have to spend more time recruiting candidates and more money trying to help them win — money that could be used to shore up already vulnerable officeholders.   \n   5. Democrats are leading on the congressional ballot test.    On average, Democrats have about a 5-point edge in polls asking people which party they'd rather see in control of Congress.   That's often referred to as the congressional ballot test in surveys. Because more districts lean toward Republicans in the country, Democrats have generally needed a wider edge on this question.   But that GOP advantage has narrowed in recent years. And, a year ago, Republicans were the ones leading on the congressional ballot, showing just how much the landscape has shifted in Democrats' favor.   There are no guarantees, a lot can change, and the Democratic Party is less popular than the GOP in many polls — mostly because Democratic voters aren't thrilled with their own leaders. But, at this moment, Democrats have the advantage.   As Cook's Erin Covey writes: \"With only a few exceptions, midterm elections have been driven by backlash to the party in power — and the Democratic Party's unpopularity hasn't kept their voters from turning out in off-year elections.   \"If the election were held today, Republicans would need to win roughly three-quarters of the Toss Up races to keep control of the House ... . Though that's not impossible, it looks increasingly difficult.\"\n",

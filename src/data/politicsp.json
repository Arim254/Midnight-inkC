    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Helena Bottemiller Evich, founder and editor in chief of Food Fix, about tensions between the MAHA movement and President Trump over glyphosate.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Make America Healthy Again supporters are angry, and it's putting Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a tough spot between his boss and his fans. And here's why. Last week, President Trump issued an executive order to increase domestic production of glyphosate, which is commonly used as a weed killer. You might know it by the brand name Roundup.And it immediately ignited an uproar in the MAHA movement. Kennedy and his base have long believed glyphosate is a health risk, but now Kennedy says he supports Trump's order. So is this the beginning of a fallout between Trump and some members of his base? To help us unpack this, we're joined now by Helena Bottemiller Evich. She's founder and editor-in-chief of the Food Fix newsletter. Welcome to the program.HELENA BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Thanks for having me.SUMMERS: OK, so just for starters, is this a fallout, a strain in the relationship? Or how would you describe what is happening right now between MAHA and Trump?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So I don't yet see this as a full-blown divorce, but we are definitely seeing a marital spat, and it's all happening in the public.SUMMERS: OK, so glyphosate, which is an active ingredient in Roundup, as we mentioned, is at the center of this very sort of public, messy spat. Why is it such a cornerstone to the MAHA agenda?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So I think MAHA at its core is really a concern about chronic disease, and there's a lot of different ways that people plug into this. Some of the MAHA moms that you'll hear about are concerned about vaccines. Some of them are concerned about environmental toxins. They're concerned about microplastics.Pesticides is one of those kind of core concerns, and that's where glyphosate falls into this. It's the most commonly used herbicide in the U.S., and a lot of MAHA moms want to see it dramatically reduced or even banned. And that has set up this conflict. We have an administration that is decidedly more deregulatory. They want to be more industry friendly. And this is really a big point of conflict.SUMMERS: And as I understand it, the science on glyphosate is pretty complicated. There's strong evidence for an association between the chemical and diseases like lymphoma and Parkinson's, but the level of exposure matters a lot, is that right?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So there is a really active debate in this space. The EPA has ruled that glyphosate is not likely to be a carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is more commonly known as IARC - that's part of the World Health Organization - they ruled that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic. That was mainly looking at animal studies.One of the key studies that everyone has long pointed to to sort of back up the safety of glyphosate, however, was recently retracted, and that has thrown up this red flag and I think really fueled even more MAHA concern that there are reasons to think that glyphosate might be contributing to cancer. Juries in the U.S. have awarded billions of dollars to individuals who believe their cancer cases were caused by glyphosate. And Bayer, which makes glyphosate, is now under tremendous pressure in the courts.SUMMERS: Back in 2018, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. won a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the maker of Roundup, arguing that the weed killer likely caused his client's cancer. So why do you think it is that he is now moving to fall in line with President Trump's plan to produce more of it in the United States?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So what Kennedy has said publicly is that he personally believes that glyphosate does cause cancer. That is not the Trump administration's official position, to be very clear. He has backed the president's executive order here, basically saying, look, the U.S. agricultural system currently relies on this, and we can't just walk away from it. It would be disastrous. He backs up the idea that we need to produce more domestically for national security reasons.SUMMERS: I know that you have been spending some time reading and hearing from members of this group. Based on what you know and what you've learned, how do you think this might end?BOTTEMILLER EVICH: I really don't know where all of this is headed, but I think the big central question at the heart of all of this is whether a deregulatory, sort of traditional Republican stance can square with what the MAHA movement fundamentally is asking for, which is a crackdown on toxins in the environment, toxins in the food supply. And they are hoping that at the end of the day, Kennedy and the noise that they make on the outside can maybe shift the Trump administration in their direction. I don't know that that will work, but that is what they are hoping for.SUMMERS: Helena Bottemiller Evich is founder and editor-in-chief of the Food Fix newsletter.

    "body": "\n      Republicans and Democrats are embracing their own takes on populism to respond to shifting politics in the country.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Democrats and Republicans traded visions for America this week, both in the State of the Union address and on the campaign trail. Both parties are embracing the core message that America's institutions are failing. But who each party blames and who they say can fix it cannot be more different. This antiestablishment thinking, known as populism, is dominating politics in the country in this moment. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and NPR political reporter Elena Moore join us now to talk about why. Hey to both of you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hello.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey there.CHANG: Hey. OK. So let's just start with the pretty basic question here. Democrats and Republicans proposed very different ideological agendas. So how is it that both parties are embracing populism at this moment?MONTANARO: Well, Ailsa, I mean, anger is really at the center of American politics right now. I mean, people are pessimistic about the direction of the country. They have a negative outlook on the economy and their position in it. And they're down on the overall political system, like you mentioned.And populism is about pitchforks. You know, who they're aimed at, though, is pretty different. You know, for the right, it's about immigrants and liberal elites and blaming them for the economic problems of blue-collar workers and the, quote, \"forgotten man and woman,\" which, of course, Trump ran on in 2016 and, you know, he did that again in the State of the Union address this week, taking aim at Somali immigrants in Minnesota for fraud cases in the state, saying that, quote, \"Americans pay the price.\" For the left, it's really about corporations and billionaires and oligarchs, as they see it, with access to power and influence.CHANG: Yeah. Let's talk more about that, Elena. Explain more about how all of that translates to a message for Democrats.MOORE: Well, there's no singular populist message on the Democratic side, and part of that is because the party doesn't have a leader, and part of that is because the party is still trying to just figure out what their broader national message looks like after losing in 2024. But, you know, we do know that this is the party's focus right now. And we have seen different rising voices in the party champion economic populist messages and really tailor them to different communities in different ways. And I think one high-profile example is James Talarico. He's a Democrat running for Senate in Texas, and primary day for that race is next week, by the way. Here's how Talarico made his pitch to voters in a recent ad that ran during the Super Bowl.(SOUNDBITE OF AD)JAMES TALARICO: Billionaires don't just influence politicians - they own them. That's why I don't take corporate PAC money. It's why I fought to cap campaign contributions. In the Senate, I'll ban billionaires from making unlimited secret donations.MOORE: So Democrats are really trying to mainstreamify that type of populist message, and I mean, it doesn't get more mainstream than the Super Bowl.CHANG: I guess not. OK. Let's go back to Republicans. Domenico, what is the Republican version of this populist message?MONTANARO: You know, this all goes back to the Tea Party movement, which came in response to what it felt like was a liberal direction that they couldn't stomach, a feeling that taxes and spending were too high as major demographic change was happening and happened to be during the presidency of the first Black president. Some of that frankly had a degree of racism attached to it. You know, Trump tried to other former President Barack Obama, pushing the racist birther theory, the false idea that he wasn't born in the United States. All the while, the, quote-unquote, \"replacement theory,\" this idea that immigrants were going to change the values and the literal complexion of the country, something that started with white nationalists and white supremacists - that was taking hold within the Republican Party, and now there's the targeting of trans rights. And it's all related because the glue for the right-wing populism that we're seeing is culture and how their preferred culture is changing or being threatened.CHANG: Well, yeah, like, let me ask you, Elena, because former President Biden was elected on this vision of restoring America to the way politics has operated for decades. And you focus on young voters in your reporting. It feels like to me that young voters do not want to see things stay the same way they have been for decades, right?MOORE: Yeah. I mean, it's worth mentioning that by 2028, Gen Z and millennials are going to make up more than half of all eligible voters in this country, and young people are just increasingly distrustful of the political system. And there's reasons behind that. They've come of age during a time where government hasn't worked for them. Many struggle with student debt or feel like high prices bar them from things like buying a house or starting a family - these economic concerns that they feel Democrats promise to address and haven't. So when candidates are running on, like, an anti-status quo, affordability-focused message, I think it appeals to a lot of young people who feel, like, frankly, fed up with the politics of the past. And I think that's why you're seeing so many younger and just progressive candidates rejecting campaign dollars from corporations and special interest groups because I think they see it as part of that broader issue set.CHANG: But Domenico, I mean, we've talked often about how Democrats are not exactly unified on how to resolve issues in this country, even when they do agree on what the problems are. So how does this kind of message work for Democrats?MONTANARO: Yeah. It's a challenge for them. And one they're probably going to have to contend with more in 2028 because midterms are so much more about the party in power and a referendum on the president. But this is eventually going to be a real issue for Democrats to contend with. You know, the left often urgently demands results that aren't always easily achievable. And for a lot of Democratic operatives, this idea of not taking corporate money when the other side is happy to flood the system is like fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. You know, so all of this, you know, creates more antipathy, though, among the key voting groups within the Democratic Party, and it's why polls have shown the left down on the Democratic Party itself.CHANG: Well, how do they resolve challenges like that?MOORE: Well, we don't exactly know for sure how this is going to play out, but I think there just may not be one sole populist playbook for Democrats. There may be a shared broader message. I mean, take New York leaders like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Mayor Zohran Mamdani. These are people with roots in Democratic socialism, and they've become national figures talking about economic inequality and affordability. But then, you know, that same focus has had broad parallels throughout the party. I mean, look at Virginia governor Abigail Spanberger. She ran last year as more of a centrist, but, you know, she made economic concerns the key part of her platform.CHANG: That is NPR's Elena Moore and Domenico Montanaro. Thank you to both of you.MONTANARO: You're welcome.MOORE: Thanks, Ailsa.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Thom Tillis chose not to seek reelection following disagreements with President Trump.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Senator Thom Tillis is not running for reelection after several high-profile disagreements with President Trump. That leaves an open Senate seat in the purple state of North Carolina. Former two-term governor Roy Cooper is expected to coast to the Democratic nomination in Tuesday's primary elections. And on the Republican side, many primary voters are looking for who would best support the president in Washington. North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner reports.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Whenever he's not working with the cases...THOMAS D EDWARDS: Uh-huh.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ...He works as a fireman (ph).ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Thomas D. Edwards stops to hear everyone out as he heads in to cast his early vote. His polling place is at the Farm Credit Farmers Market in Wayne County, about an hour southeast of Raleigh. On his way out. Edwards does not say who he supports for the Senate, but he makes clear that Trump's backing factors into his thinking.EDWARDS: Remember, smart people do smart things. Stupid people do stupid things. And I don't look at Mr. Trump as being a stupid man.WAGNER: Many Republicans voting in this primary hold a similar view. They're looking for a candidate they know will support Trump, and Trump has made his choice clear. Last summer, he stepped into this race, endorsing then-Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley. In December, Whatley appeared with Trump in Rocky Mount.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL WHATLEY: I am going to be a fighter every day for this great state. I am going to be a conservative champion for North Carolina, and I am going to be an ally to our great president.WAGNER: Along with Trump's endorsement, Whatley holds a major lead in fundraising in the campaign. Still, he has several primary challengers who are trying to make the case that they've shown they are actually more likely to back Trump. Those include Don Brown and Michele Morrow. Brown is a former U.S. Navy JAG officer who has defended people charged in connection with the January 6 riots, and Morrow is a former state superintendent candidate who has previously called for the execution of several prominent Democrats.Republican voters interviewed by the North Carolina Newsroom at some polling places during early voting showed a clear preference in the race. James Huffman braved frigid temperatures to vote in Alamance County this week, about an hour northwest of Raleigh. He voted for Whatley.JAMES HUFFMAN: I'm just looking for stability - conservative stability - and someone who is winnable.WAGNER: Michael Bitzer, the chair of Catawba College's political science department, says for Whatley's campaign, quote, \"winnable\" means showing allegiance to the president.MICHAEL BITZER: It starts with Trump and it ends with Trump. And I think the loyalty that a lot of Trump Republicans, MAGA Republicans, want from members of Congress to the president is where Whatley sees the clear indication of winning the primary.WAGNER: That alignment with Trump could give Whatley the boost he needs in the primary, but Trump's approval ratings have started to falter in North Carolina, and Bitzer warns that might work against Whatley in November. Meanwhile, Cooper's attention is already turning towards that general election.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROY COOPER: I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I'm concerned about the cost that everyday families are feeling right now.WAGNER: North Carolina voters have sent Republicans to the U.S. Senate in every election since 2010. But Cooper is well known here. He's won six consecutive statewide elections. That means this Senate seat could be in play in November.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with political consultant and longtime Clinton ally Paul Begala  about the depositions of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We wanted to get another perspective on the Clintons' deposition, so we've called Paul Begala. He's a longtime political strategist who helped orchestrate Bill Clinton's presidential win in 1992 and worked in the Clinton White House as counselor to the president. Good morning, Paul Begala. Thanks so much for joining us.PAUL BEGALA: Thanks, Michel.MARTIN: So what do you make of what happened yesterday?BEGALA: (Laughter) I can't wait for the tape. I'm laughing because I don't know if you've ever argued with Hillary Clinton, but I have. It doesn't go well. She's brilliant. She's focused. And - but she was pretty annoyed, I'm quite sure. So I can't wait to see it. I mean, it's an unpleasant thing. I'm sorry my friend had to go through it. But I have very little doubt that they finished that hearing with tire tracks across their faces because I think she just ran right over them.MARTIN: Well, some senior Democrats like Nancy Pelosi said everybody associated with Epstein should be deposed regardless of party. So - and on that basis, do you think it was fair that they were called?BEGALA: Well, it just dragged them in. They weren't associated, especially Hillary. But they're not associated. They didn't have anything useful to report. If this were an on-the-level investigation, absolutely. But when Leslie Wexner - the millionaire who was much more closely tied to Mr. Epstein - he was deposed, no Republicans showed up, and he probably had useful information. So it's not on the level. They're just dragging the Clintons in 'cause they're famous Democrats.MARTIN: Well, I take your point. I mean, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she never met Epstein, but it is the case that former President Clinton was pictured with Epstein. He flew on his plane multiple times. He contributed to Epstein's 50th birthday book in 2003. And both the former president and the former secretary of state did benefit from Epstein's political donations back in the 1990s. Visitor logs obtained by the Daily Mail said that Epstein made 17 trips to the White House during the Clinton administration. So on that basis?BEGALA: Oh, they should - they can ask them about all that. I suspect those White House trips were, like, for donors to the Historical Association and things like that. But the - Bill Clinton is the only guy in this whole sordid disgusting affair who hasn't had to change his story. He's the only guy who hasn't lied. He said, I never went to Epstein's island. I never went to Epstein's ranch. I never knew about any of his crimes, and I cut off contact with him long before he died.By the way, Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, has said, yeah, Trump was wrong. Clinton never went to Epstein's Island, and she claimed that she'd seen all the files. So he's the only guy as more and more information has come out, has been proved to have been telling the truth from the beginning. And, believe me, if there was something more in those files that could damage Bill Clinton, I do trust the Trump Justice Department to put that out.MARTIN: So we just heard that Republican committee chair James Comer said that many of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's - former First Lady Hillary Clinton's answers were essentially, so ask Bill, ask the former president. Do you expect that he will give some substantive answers today that we might hear more about? And do you think that that testimony, his testimony, at some point will also be made public?BEGALA: Oh, I want it all made public, and I'm sure the president does - former president. I - of course, he's going to answer all their questions. But his - he - again, his story hasn't changed. He just doesn't have any useful information. He didn't really know the guy. He never went to his island. He never went to his ranch. He never knew anything about his crimes and cut off all contact with him.I think the real problem here strategically is that this means Donald Trump is going to have to testify, right? There used to be a precedent, the Trump precedent. The January 6 Committee subpoenaed Trump. He was a former president. He not only refused to obey the subpoena, he sued the committee. Because no - except for Gerald Ford once, no former president has ever testified to Congress. OK. That was the Trump rule. Well, now there's a Clinton rule. And Donald Trump's going to have to live by that Clinton rule. In 1,057 days, he will no longer be president. It'll be a Saturday. The sun will shine. The birds will chirp.MARTIN: OK.BEGALA: And former President Trump will be subpoenaed to tell what he knows about the Epstein crimes.MARTIN: Why do you think it - I mean, Congressman Robert Garcia, a Democrat, wants reporters admitted to hear it - to the room to hear former President Clinton's deposition? Why do you think the Republicans keep rejecting that?BEGALA: I don't know. I - this is the first group of clowns that didn't want an audience. I think that's why. I mean, Hillary said that they asked her about UFOs and about this horrible Pizzagate lie, conspiracy theory. I believe that it's because they probably don't conduct themselves with the kind of professionalism that we saw, say, in the January 6 committee, which all of their hearings, so far as I know, were public.MARTIN: So before we let you go, I'm sure you've heard an NPR investigation found that files related to President Trump - Epstein Files - are missing from the public record. How do you advise Democrats to proceed to have those files released?BEGALA: I think they just keep having to press. I would caution them not to jump to any conclusions at all 'cause they don't know what's in them either. But I think we have a right to see them. I think the American people and, God knows, those survivors have a right to see what's in those files. And I think that that's something that they're going to keep pressing. And again, I think the Democrats are going to win the midterms, and then they'll have real subpoena power.MARTIN: OK.BEGALA: And they'll get them.MARTIN: That is Paul Begala.

    "body": "\n      Democratic Rep. Wesley Bell of Missouri, a member of the House Oversight Committee, talks about the deposition of the Clintons in the Epstein probe, which continues Friday with the former president.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Congressman Wesley Bell, a Democrat from Missouri, is a member of that House panel, the Oversight Committee, which is expected to hear from former President Bill Clinton today. We actually reached him at a diner in New York in advance of the hearing. Good morning, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.WESLEY BELL: Hey. Good to be here, and I got my coffee at the diner so (laughter)...MARTIN: Excellent. Good to hear. So former first lady, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeatedly said she never met Jeffrey Epstein, but the former president obviously had. There are photographs of them together. The president's spokesperson acknowledges that Mr. Clinton took four international trips on Epstein's plane for the Clinton Foundation's charity works. He had a meeting with Epstein in New York, et cetera. So what do you think you might learn from him today?BELL: You know, I've - he released his declaration, and so I anticipate it will be similar to that, obviously, more detail. But, you know, what I've said is - and I've led these type of depositions before as a former prosecutor, what we're seeing is political theater. This is not a serious investigation by Republicans, and it's disappointing because there are real victims. There are real survivors who deserve justice and deserve us to do a full and transparent investigation, and that's just not what we're seeing.MARTIN: Is it possible that this sets a precedent that might allow for President Trump to be deposed regarding Mr. Epstein?BELL: I mean, the precedent has been set at this point. You know, if Republicans feel that it's necessary to depose the former president, which I'm not opposed to hearing information - any information that leads us or gets us closer to uncovering the truth. But then that also includes the current president, that includes the current first lady, that includes Howard Lutnick. It includes Elon Musk and a slew of others. I don't care what the letter is in front of your name, if there is information that will help an investigation so that we can bring justice to the survivors and victims, then that's what we need to do.MARTIN: It - just one more question on this question of sort of political theater. The fact is the FEC filings do show that Bill and Hillary Clinton both benefited from Epstein's political donations. Now, that was back in the 1990s. There are visitor logs that show that Epstein made 17 trips to the White House. That was in the Clinton administration, and the Clinton Foundation did receive a significant donation from Epstein's nonprofit. Now, that was 2006. Now, that was before he was convicted - that Mr. Epstein was convicted in connection with these sex trafficking charges, but it does indicate a relationship there. Is that not worthy of some discussion or investigation?BELL: Again, I am - been on the record publicly and privately. Anyone who has information, we want to hear from, and that includes the Clintons. So I don't have any issue with hearing them and deposing them. But what I'm seeing from this administration, from House Republicans, is that they want all the information from Democrats to smear Democrats, but they stop at Republicans. And then when I hear the talking points from Republicans that Donald Trump was exonerated when we have living survivors who are saying the opposite and publicly saying that, and we know that there are at least 50 pages of missing Epstein files that include Donald Trump, so they need to release all the files. They need to do a serious investigation because at the end of the day, Americans want to know, and victims and survivors deserve to know.MARTIN: So a couple of more questions about the - just the hearings themselves. Hillary Clinton said she wanted her testimony and Mr. Clinton's to be public. Can you offer any insight into why this was denied?BELL: It was denied because Republican - House Republicans denied it. They don't want to be transparent. They want to say that they're being transparent. They want to use it as a talking point, but the proof isn't right here in the pudding. Democrats have asked for these depositions to be public. The Clintons asked for these depositions to be public. The media was a hundred yards away outside. We could've easily just opened the door and let them in, but Republicans refused and then released pictures, released leaked comments and statements. It's ridiculous. It's not serious, and Republicans need to take this seriously because victims and survivors deserve it.MARTIN: Before we let you go, just very briefly, you mentioned that a right-wing influencer posted a photo online of Hillary Clinton, apparently taken by your Republican colleague Lauren Boebert during the closed deposition. That's a violation of House rules. Is there going to be a consequence for this?BELL: I think there should be. You know, I think there should be. I think that the rules were made by the Republicans. They decided to make these depositions closed, and then they violated the - their own rules.MARTIN: That is Democratic Congressman Wesley Bell of Missouri. He's a member of the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, thank you.BELL: My pleasure.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      In an effort to stabilize child care in America, the Biden administration changed how child care subsidies are paid. The Trump administration says the change invited fraud and is preparing a reversal.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Across the country, many child care providers are barely staying afloat. As essential as they are, their industry operates on tiny profit margins. And now the Trump administration is rolling back policies aimed at providing stability. The rationale is the prevention of fraud. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports.ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Michelle Wright runs two child care centers in Southwestern Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.MICHELLE WRIGHT: You OK?(SOUNDBITE OF COUGHING)HSU: This time of year, bad weather and illnesses can take a toll.WRIGHT: It's wintertime. It's Midwest.HSU: Attendance sometimes drops below 70%, which is a problem for Wright, and here's why. Ninety percent of the families she serves qualify for child care subsidies, which the state pays out based on attendance. So when a lot of kids are absent, she may not get paid what she was expecting. She has to scramble to figure out if she'll be able to pay her teachers.WRIGHT: That staff comes ready to work. Maybe spent gas, maybe took a Uber or a bus to get here. And then six kids are out, and I know the numbers are down. I have to send their staff home.HSU: It's a unique challenge for those like Wright, who want to serve low-income communities.WRIGHT: I chose the area because of the need.HSU: Things would be easier if she had opened her centers in more affluent areas. Families who pay for care themselves typically pay up front, and they're on the hook for the tuition, whether their children come in or not. Subsidy payments here in Illinois and many other states go out after the care has been provided and based on who shows up, allowing for some number of absences. Wright says, this is one reason there's not a lot of high-quality child care in low-income areas. It doesn't make business sense.WRIGHT: Most people won't take 90% subsidy.HSU: This issue came to a head during COVID, when many children were out for days. To keep day cares open, more states began paying based on who was enrolled, not who showed up. Turned out to be a game changer for many day cares, giving them predictability. Later, the Biden administration issued a rule mandating all states make this change and pay the subsidies upfront, like private-paying families do. Dozens of states got waivers, giving them more time to comply, but now the rule is getting scrapped altogether.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM O'NEILL: Hello, I'm HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill.HSU: This is a video posted by the Department of Health and Human Services in January. O'Neill, who has since left HHS, says requiring states to pay for care up front and based on enrollment created vulnerabilities.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O'NEILL: Those policies weakened accountability and made fraud easier, not harder.HSU: This announcement came shortly after allegations of child care fraud erupted in Minnesota. Such fraud is rare, but it does happen. In the past, providers have been found guilty of claiming subsidies for children who weren't in their care. States have moved to safeguard their systems with more oversight, more unannounced visits by state inspectors. Still, child care advocates worry the Trump administration's focus on fraud could get in the way of progress.DENISE WIESE: Ready?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Get it.WIESE: One, two, three.UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: [inaudible].HSU: At Lemay Child and Family Center in St. Louis County, Missouri, Denise Wiese, the center's executive director, has been looking forward to changes in how subsidies are paid. Last year, Missouri's Republican legislature approved making payments up front based on who's enrolled, not on who shows up. Beta testing has been underway, and...WIESE: We're hoping by mid-year, that will be throughout the state.HSU: But late last year, the state announced it needed more time to ensure the new system works correctly and to secure long-term funding because it will be more expensive. Whether the changes happen or not, Wiese is pushing for more investment, sustained investment in child care.WIESE: We have to take care of the children in our communities. They're the ones that are going to lead this country and lead the state 30 years from now.HSU: She says the country can't have a stable future without stable child care, Andrea Hsu, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The Republican-led committee subpoenaed Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to appear in its investigation into convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.    The former president will take questions Friday from the committee.   In a short press conference following the deposition, Hillary Clinton said she wished the proceedings had been public and that she and her attorneys have asked for transcripts and videos to be available as soon as possible.   \n   \"It was disappointing that they refused to hold a public hearing so I wouldn't have to be out here characterizing it for you,\" she told reporters outside the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in New York where the hearing took place. \"You could have seen it for yourself. We had asked for that. We think it would have been better for the committee and its efforts to gather whatever information they are seeking.\"    Lamenting what she called \"repetitive\" questioning, Clinton said she would not appear before the committee again, even if the deposition were public.    \"I don't know how many times I had to say I did not know Jeffrey Epstein. I never went to his island, I never went to his home, I never went to his offices,\" she said. The former president, her husband Bill, did have a friendship with Epstein and photographs of him appear in the Epstein files. Bill Clinton has not be accused of wrongdoing.    Clinton said by the end of the hearing, Republicans were asking her off-topic questions about UFOs and the pizzagate conspiracy theory that falsely claimed some high-profile Democrats were involved in a child sex-trafficiking ring.    In a preview of what lawmakers may hear from former President Bill Clinton Friday, Hillary Clinton said she was confident that Bill Clinton knew nothing about Epstein's criminal history and that her husband's relationship with Epstein ended \"several years before anything about Epstein's criminal history came to light.\"    \n   She added Epstein was given a sweetheart deal when he was initially charged and convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from underage girls in Florida.    \"I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of people who had contact with him before his criminal pleas in '08, they did not know what he was doing,\" Clinton said, \"and I think that that is exactly what my husband will testify to tomorrow.\"    Committee Chair, Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, said he hopes to have the video publicly available within the next 24 hours. The transcript, Comer said, will be published once Clinton's attorneys approve it, which are the standard rules of a deposition.    Despite a brief interruption shortly after the proceedings started, when Clinton halted the deposition after a photo from inside the room was posted by a conservative influencer on X, the questioning ultimately continued with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.    Speaking after the deposition, Comer and his fellow Republicans said it was  productive and that Clinton answered most of their questions but that it \"was a shame\" that it took months to get the Clintons to agree to testify.    \"I think we learned a lot. There were a lot of questions that we asked that we, you know, weren't satisfied with the answers that we got, but we will continue to move forward,\" Comer said.    Comer said there were a number of times Clinton responded with \"I don't know, you'll have to ask my husband.\" And that is exactly what he plans to do on Friday.   \"We have a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow, and I'm confident that deposition will last even longer than this one,\" Comer said.\n",

The decision to impose new restrictions would be up to local housing authorities and private property owners who rent to people using a housing voucher, known as Section 8. Time limits could be as short as two years, and work requirements up to 40 hours a week. Those who are elderly or disabled – a majority of people with federal rental subsidies – would be exempt.   \n   President Trump proposed a two-year limit in his White House budget last year, along with slashing rental aid by 40%, but Congress rejected that. This rule would bypass Congress, assuming it's finalized.   Housing Secretary Scott Turner has said repeatedly that he wants to help tenants get off federal aid and promote self-sufficiency. Last year, he and three other Cabinet members wrote a New York Times opinion piece calling on Congress to expand work requirements across safety net programs. They said an increasing share of public benefits are not going to the \"truly needy,\" but to able-bodied adults who don't work.   Some 9 million people in the U.S. get federal housing assistance, and the cost of rent is unaffordable for large numbers of Americans.    \n   \"This proposal is based on false and harmful stereotypes, rather than concrete data or best practices,\" Deborah Thrope, deputy director at the National Housing Law Project, said in a statement. \"It ignores the fact that most participants in federal housing programs who can work, do in fact work. Saving enough to move off of assistance takes a long time and a lot of support.\"   The case for time limits on housing subsidies   Rental assistance is not an entitlement, and demand far outstrips the funds available. For the lucky minority who do get a housing voucher or a spot in public housing, often after waiting for years, they can keep it as long as needed. Supporters say time limits could help spread limited rental aid among more people.   \n   \"There's a whole lot of people who qualify for this kind of aid who don't receive it. So there's an inefficient use of our housing, because people can stay so long,\" said Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.   He said time limits could also encourage upward mobility, but should be not be imposed \"in a vacuum.\" To be effective, Husock said, a time limit should include a fixed rent and automatic savings accounts, so people can get ahead as their income rises.   Delaware State Housing Authority is one agency that's had success with such a program. Its time limit is 5-7 years, but can stretch longer in some cases.   The track record for time limits is mixed   Nationwide there are about 3,300 local public agencies that provide federally subsidized housing. Only about 140 of them currently have the flexibility to try things like time limits and work requirements, and only a few dozen have done so.   \n   \"I just don't necessarily think that a hard term limit has generated the sort of outcomes that people are looking for,\" Joshua Meehan told NPR last year. He advocates for these agencies as president of the Moving to Work Collaborative.   The group includes Keene Housing in New Hampshire, which Meehan now leads. It used to have a 5-year time limit but dropped it. As the deadline to end people's assistance approached it was clear their incomes had not increased by much.   \"I think it's fair to assume they would have wound up back on our waiting lists,\" he said.   Given that track record, it's not clear whether a significant number of housing authorities would choose to adopt the new restrictions. Forcing millions of people to give up their subsidy every few years could also rattle the private landlords who lease to those with a housing voucher.   \n   The proposed rule is scheduled to be published Monday, and will be open 60-days for public comment.\n",

Katie Britt, R-Ala., arrives for a meeting on Capitol Hill on June 18, 2024. Britt has taken on a leading role helping negotiate changes to immigration enforcement.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Stay up to date with our Politics newsletter, sent weekly.      Two years ago, Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama accepted what is often called the worst assignment in politics — rebutting the president's State of the Union address.   The televised response, broadcast live from Britt's tidy kitchen in Montgomery, was the Alabama freshman's introduction to a national audience, and what many viewers saw was an over-the-top firebrand, parodied as a \"scary mom\" by actress Scarlett Johansson on Saturday Night Live.   \"The American dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families,\" Britt said in the speech.   \n   Standing in as her party's pick to rebut the president, ahead of his reelection bid no less, is a daunting task for any up-and-coming politician, but even some Republicans described Britt's performance with words like baffling and bizarre.   Colleagues say this initial caricature of Britt as a hyper-partisan MAGA mom is simply untrue. In the Senate, Britt has been building a different reputation — as a bipartisan dealmaker.   Now Britt is helping negotiate changes to how immigration agents operate after the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis as Democrats refuse to fund the Department of Homeland Security without reforms. The department has now been shut down for more than 10 days.   And at a time of deep polarization, this moment is testing how far Britt, and other lawmakers, are willing to go to tackle knotty policy problems captivating national attention.   A front row seat   Veteran Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers first met Britt when she was a teenager attending a prestigious girls leadership program. Flowers was so impressed, he called up his old friend, Alabama's long-serving Republican senator, Richard Shelby.   \"And I said, 'Shelby, I just met a young woman who's got U.S. Senator or governor written all over her.\"   \n   Britt went to work on Capitol Hill for Shelby, who for years was the top Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a group so bipartisan in nature that Hill veterans are known to joke about three categories of lawmakers — Republicans, Democrats and appropriators.   Shelby taught young aides that your word is your bond and making deals across the aisle hinges on trust, and often, genuine friendship. Shelby and his counterpart on the committee, former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., were like brothers, Flowers said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Katie Britt for the 118th Congress on Jan. 3, 2023. At 40 years old, Britt became the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate.\n                \n                    Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Quite frankly, it's the ingredient that is necessary for any of that to come together,\" says Dayne Cutrell, a former Shelby staffer who overlapped with Britt. \"Not only does she see it because of who she is, but she had a front row seat to somebody that was able to do it for years to the benefit of the state.\"   Cutrell remembers when Britt eventually became Shelby's chief of staff, she made a point of meeting with all 99 other Senate chiefs. \"And not only did she do it, she did it in like two weeks,\" Cutrell said.   When Shelby retired after 2022, Britt, at 40 years old, became the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate. In her Capitol Hill office, Britt displays a gold-framed handbill from Shelby's first campaign for the Alabama Senate in 1970. Her desk was once Shelby's – and before that, Lyndon B. Johnson's.   \"Now that she is a member, she is the same person that wants to know not just you as an individual, but your family and what makes you tick and why it's important,\" Cutrell said.   \"Anybody can go sit in a corner\"   That's in part why Britt was able to help bring Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., onto a deal to end the record-long government shutdown last fall, despite deep opposition from others in his party. The pair already had a relationship from drafting legislation on affordable child care.   \n   \"I was testing ideas with her, and when it looked like things might break down, [she would say] 'Hey come on let's keep talking.' We may disagree, but I'll get a read on where's the caucus, where's the White House likely to be on this, and that's helpful,\" Kaine said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britt speaks on the phone at the National Prayer Breakfast in the Kennedy Caucus Room on Capitol Hill on Feb. 05. Britt says her constituents sent her to Washington to find compromise. \"Anybody can go sit in a corner,\" she says.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   At a time when compromise seems to have little political upside, why wade in? Britt says that is what her constituents sent her to Washington to do.   \"Anybody can go sit in a corner,\" Britt said in an interview. \"Two-year-olds do it best, and we have a lot of people that are taking their ball and sitting in the corner. And I just think it's too critical of a moment in our country's history to do that.\"   A delicate balance    For many members, the latest inflection point in the country was the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.   For Britt, it was the viral image of a five-year-old boy in a bunny hat and Spiderman backpack being detained by federal officers there that she could not shake — so much so that she raised questions about the incident with the administration.   There were reports that federal officers were using the boy to lure other potential targets for arrest. Britt's office scheduled a call with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, first reported by The New York Times. Britt said Noem assured her that was not true.   And Britt has refrained from mentioning the boy in her public remarks, instead focusing on criticizing Democrats for refusing to fund the Department of Homeland Security amid negotiations.   \"I'm over it,\" Britt told her colleagues recently on the floor. \"Everybody on that side of the aisle knows that ICE and CBP will continue to be funded. They're going to continue to enforce the law just as they should. Who's going to pay the price? It's the TSA agent, it's the person working at FEMA.\"   \n   That message has frustrated Democratic negotiators who were already irked when Britt called their demands a \"ridiculous Christmas list.\"   \"My wish is for my Republican colleagues to be just as upset as they are about what is going to happen at TSA or FEMA as for the children that are being traumatized right now,\" responded Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Britt's counterpart on the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., talks to Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., during a March 29, 2023 hearing on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Murphy and Britt worked together to negotiate the homeland security funding bill that was set to pass with bipartisan support before the deadly shootings in Minneapolis.   Senate Republicans have signaled that much of the back and forth so far has been directly between Democrats and the White House — and there have been few signs of progress in recent days.   Democrats and Republicans say Britt's appeal as an emerging mediator comes not only from trust she has built across the aisle, but also with her party's leadership in the Senate and the White House.   Maintaining all three is a delicate balance.   In 2025 Britt voted in line with President Trump 100% of the time on legislation he took a position on, according to Congressional Quarterly.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britt listens as President Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Oct.16, 2025. Britt has been a reliable vote for the president's agenda, but criticized a racist video posted on his social media.\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But she was one of a few Republicans to criticize a racist video posted on President Trump's social media, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. Britt said the video \"should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.\"   Trump saw the critical comment as disloyalty, according to CNN, a report Britt's office called \"fake news.\"   Ideologues and facilitators    Flowers, the Alabama columnist, sees two types of senators: idealogues: \"You may have one who will be a Fox News-chasing publicity hound who wants to be known as a right-wing fire eater,\" he said.   And facilitators, like Shelby. \"That's what Katie's role will be: bring home the bacon, get things done for Alabama, as well as voting conservative,\" Flowers said.   \n   Flowers says it is not as easy to be a facilitator as it was in Shelby's day. He said he hopes Britt won't be pulled away from her approach as she steps further onto the national stage.   \"I think it is harder now to do that, but maybe she can balance it,\" Flowers said. \"She doesn't owe Trump anything. She'll be there long after Trump's gone.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Democrats are meeting this week to discuss their strategy to regain control of the House in the upcoming midterm elections.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Democrats are wrapping up a retreat today trying to figure out a strategy to take back control of the U.S. House. They're planning for this year's midterms as President Trump's poll numbers are falling across a range of issues. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales talked to Democrats at their retreat in Leesburg, Virginia, and she's with us now to tell us more about it. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So you've covered quite a few of these retreats.GRISALES: Right.MARTIN: How would you describe the mood there, especially compared to last year, say, and the year before?GRISALES: Yeah. There was a very different mood. Democrats were very energized, and you could tell, in terms of their strategy, they had a more unified message and plan versus last year, where it felt like they were lost in a political wilderness.MARTIN: So how are they preparing for November?GRISALES: Well, they say they're going to reach voters by selling them an alternate agenda to the president's policies right now. Leaders said what their closing message would be this fall. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark said this is what Americans will hear.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATHERINE CLARK: They deserve better. A better economy, better schools, better health care, a better and more affordable future.GRISALES: And in addition to affordability, they said another major part of their agenda is oversight of the Trump administration. They developed this plan by going to constituents, and these are the issues that rose to the top. And Democrats have said they learned hard lessons on how not to ignore voters. They learned that in the last election cycle and say they're determined not to repeat those mistakes again.MARTIN: Like what mistakes?GRISALES: Well, one member joked that some members have learned how to use a podcast and how to show up on a podcast. But essentially, they are committed, they said, to spend time both in person and online, getting to voters where they are.MARTIN: So let's talk about that affordability agenda. What exactly are House Democrats proposing?GRISALES: Well, a major focus is health care, and they want to address the rise in costs there from reversing cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and reinstating health care subsidies that expired last year for the Affordable Care Act. They're also aiming to end Trump's tariff programs. They say those have led to higher costs for everything from groceries to housing, and with that, they're crafting legislative proposals to address these issues this year.MARTIN: You also mentioned plans for more oversight of the Trump administrations. Can you say more about that?GRISALES: I talked to Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, who's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee who could be the chair if Democrats take over the House. He says they want to tackle what they see as the weaponization of the government against U.S. citizens. That includes the deaths of Americans at the hands of federal immigration law enforcement agents in Minneapolis. So this would be comprehensive investigations that he and others argue have not happened. And after that, forcing the Justice Department to release the full tranche of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Congress has passed legislation requiring that, but Democrats say the administration has not complied.MARTIN: So all is not rosy, though, for the Democrats. There still are headwinds that they have to prepare for. So talk about that, if you would.GRISALES: Right. There's quite a few. To start, if Democrats are successful in any capacity, they're still heading into a divided government. So legislatively, they're going to face obstacles from President Trump and if Republicans keep control of the Senate. Democrats are also facing efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans that they say will make it harder to vote. This is an effort Democrats say they're preparing to fight in court. But they're still expressing a lot of confidence and that, along with the historical precedent of the opposition party performing well in the midterms, they're riding a new wave of enthusiasm. They point to special election races results, where they saw successful outcomes, for example, in New Jersey. But they still need to flesh out a lot of specifics on these plans, and with a caucus that has a lot of diverse opinions, that will be a tall order.MARTIN: That is NPR's Claudia Grisales. Claudia, thank you.GRISALES: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF QUANTIC'S \"TIME IS THE ENEMY\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

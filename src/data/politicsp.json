U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, in a memo released Thursday, said it would pause the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from the additional countries. The memo also outlines plans to re-review applications of immigrants from these countries as far back as 2021.   The list, which is composed mostly of countries in Africa, includes Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.   Last month, the Trump administration expanded the list of countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. from 19 to 39, plus the Palestinian Authority. The move comes as the administration is bringing sharper scrutiny of those who have followed legal steps to seek permanent status in the U.S.   \n   Loading...\n   \"USCIS remains dedicated to ensuring aliens from high-risk countries of concern who have entered the United States do not pose risks to national security or public safety,\" the memo states as rational for the pause and reviews. \"To faithfully uphold United States immigration law, the flow of aliens from countries with high overstay rates, significant fraud, or both must stop.\"   There are some exceptions outlined in the memo, including athletes and members of their teams competing in the World Cup and  Olympics.   The administration first suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.   Toward the end of 2025, DHS began taking steps to further pause and review these legal avenues of migration. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees processing of applications including for visas, naturalizations and asylum, announced it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases.   The agency also previously announced an indefinite pause in all processing of asylum applications while it works through its backlog.\n",

Ro Khanna, a Democrat representing California, says the Justice Department should've anticipated the challenge posed by the large volume of files related to the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   The Justice Department missed a legal deadline two weeks ago to release the full trove of unclassified Epstein files. The incomplete release has drawn widespread criticism and bipartisan calls for action against the DOJ.   Khanna said in an interview with Morning Edition that the DOJ should've started preparing the files for release months ago when the Epstein Files Transparency Act was introduced. But Khanna added that he and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who co-authored the law signed by President Trump, are less concerned about the delay and more concerned about the documents the DOJ is withholding.   \n   \"We want to see the survivors' statements to the FBI, where they name other rich and powerful men who abused them or who covered up the crimes. And we want to see the draft prosecution memos which explain why many, many men were involved in the cover-up and abuse,\" Khanna said.   Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Khanna discussed why a complete release is key for transparency and what actions Congress may take to speed up the process.

A French government bulletin published last weekend confirms that the country has granted citizenship to George Clooney, along with his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their 7-year-old twins.   The Clooneys — who hail from Lexington, Ky. and Beirut, Lebanon, respectively — bought an 18th-century estate in Provence, France in 2021. In an Esquire interview this October, the Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker described the French \"farm\" as their primary residence, a decision he said was made with their kids in mind.   \n   \"I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood,\" Clooney said. \"I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France — they kind of don't give a s*** about fame. I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.\"   In another interview on his recent Jay Kelly press tour, Clooney mentioned that his wife and kids speak perfect French, joking that they use it to insult him to his face while he still struggles to learn the language.   This week, after a French official raised questions of fairness, France's Foreign Ministry explained that the Clooneys were eligible under a law that permits citizenship for foreign nationals who contribute to the country's international influence and cultural outreach, The Associated Press reports.   The French government specifically cited the actor's clout as a global movie star and the lawyer's work with academic institutions and international organizations in France.   \"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry added, per the AP. \"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community.\"   \n   They aren't the only ones celebrating. President Trump, who has a history of trading barbs with Clooney, welcomed the news by taking another dig at the actor.   \n   In a New Year's Eve Truth Social post, Trump called the couple \"two of the worst political prognosticators of all time\" and slammed Clooney for throwing his support behind then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election.   \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,\" wrote Trump, who himself has made cameos in several films over the years. \"He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"   Clooney responded the next day via a statement shared with outlets including Deadline and Variety.   \"I totally agree with the current president,\" Clooney said, before referencing the midterm elections later this year. \"We have to make America great again. We'll start in November.\"   Clooney and Trump — once friendly — have long criticized each other   Clooney, a longtime activist and Democratic Party donor, has remained active in U.S. politics despite his overseas move.   In July 2024, he rocked the political establishment by publishing a New York Times op-ed urging then-President Joe Biden — for whom he had prominently fundraised just weeks prior — to drop his reelection bid to make way for another Democrat with better chances of taking the White House. A growing chorus of calls led to Biden's withdrawal from the race by the end of that month.   \n   In a December interview with NPR's Fresh Air, Clooney said his decision to speak out on that and other issues generally comes down to \"when I feel like no one else is gonna do it.\"   \"You'll lose all of your clout if you fight every fight,\" he added. \"You have to pick the ones that you know well, that you're well informed on, and that you have some say and you hope that that has at least some effect.\"   Clooney has been a vocal critic of Trump throughout both of his terms, most recently on the topic of press freedoms during the actor's Broadway portrayal of the late journalist Edward R. Murrow last spring.   \n   And Trump has been similarly outspoken in his dislike of Clooney, including in an insult-laden Truth Social post — calling him a \"fake movie actor\" — after the publication of his New York Times op-ed.   In December, just days before this latest dust-up, Clooney shared in a Variety interview that he and Trump had been on good terms during the president's reality television days. He said Trump used to call him often and once tried to help him get into a hospital to see a back surgeon.   \n   \"He's a big goofball. Well, he was,\" Clooney added. \"That all changed.\"   In the same Variety interview, Clooney — the son of longtime television anchor Nick Clooney — slammed CBS and ABC for abandoning their journalistic duty by paying to settle lawsuits with the Trump administration. He expressed concern about the current media landscape, particularly the direction of CBS News under its controversial new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.   \n   Weiss responded by inviting Clooney to visit the CBS Broadcast Center to learn more about their work, in a written statement published in the New York Post on Tuesday. It began with \"Bonjour, Mr. Clooney,\" in a nod to the actor's new milestone.   Clooney told NPR last month that he will continue to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means people who disagree with him decide not to see his movies.   \"I don't give up my right to freedom of speech because I have a Screen Actors Guild card,\" he added. \"The minute that I'm asked to just straight-up lie, then I've lost.\"\n",

No matter what happens, it will be consequential.   Let's take a look at some questions now that the new year is here:   1. Does the outlook on the economy change or remain the same?   Americans are sour on the economy, and Trump and the GOP are suffering because of it. In the December NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, 63% of respondents said the country is headed in the wrong direction. Trump gets just a 38% approval rating overall and an even lower 36% for his handling of the economy.   \n   A majority of people think the country is already in a recession, even though technically it isn't. They are pessimistic about what's ahead for this year, and prices are by far the top economic concern.   \n   Democrats benefited at the ballot box in 2025 from those grim views, winning special congressional elections, the off-year gubernatorial elections and more. Winning off-year special elections is a good barometer of which party will do well in the following year's midterm elections, and the party in power has historically borne the brunt of the political punishment in tough times.   That's likely to happen again if views of the economy and the cost of living don't improve.   2. What does Trump try to do on affordability?   Most presidents get more blame and credit than they deserve on economic success or failure. But in Trump's case, he's actively made things more expensive with his policies, particularly when it comes to the tariffs he's implemented.   Polling has shown that people are blaming him for that, too. Two-thirds in the latest NPR poll said tariffs were a concern as it related to their budgets, and there is a Supreme Court decision looming about their legality. A November Yahoo/YouGov poll found that people felt, by a 2-to-1 margin, Trump had done more to raise prices than lower them.   \n   So is there something tangible he can do to address it or appear to address it? He has already pulled back some tariffs on agricultural goods in an attempt to ease prices and has promised a bailout for farmers. Will he try for a new tax credit or attempt to brow beat corporations into absorbing more of the costs? His efforts at selling his economy during an end-of-year address didn't crystallize any specific pushes he would be making.   The White House has tried to get the president out of Washington more to do events around \"affordability,\" but even at those, the president has veered back to the issue that has animated his base and given fuel to his politics – immigration and the culture war.   \n   It's something of a myth that presidents can persuade Americans to have a better view of the economy with their messaging. But they can certainly make things worse by not appearing to take economic concerns seriously or empathizing with voters' pain.   3. How much does Trump campaign for other Republicans?   Trump puts GOP candidates in a vise. He remains popular with the base, but he is toxic with independents. Despite maintaining solid approval ratings with Republicans, his overall job approval is at or near the lowest of his second term.   Independents and Latinos, two key crossover groups Trump did well with in 2024, have slid away from him, according to multiple polls and election results in 2025.   Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, said she is going to get the president out on the campaign trail more than he might want this year. It will be notable to see where he goes and for whom.   Trump has a Midas touch in GOP primaries, but it's the opposite in general elections in competitive races.   There's a real question of just how much political capital Trump has left. He's turning 80 in June and is term-limited. He's on the brink of lame-duck status that could only be expedited with major losses, if they happen, in the November midterms. So will more Republicans, looking to a Trump-less horizon, start carving out their own paths?   4. Do we see more departures from Congress?   When members of Congress from the party in power decide not to run for reelection in big numbers, that can be indicative of a coming electoral wave.   And so far, a record number of House members and senators have announced they are not running for reelection — 56 out of 535, or more than 10%.   In the House alone, 44 incumbents are not seeking reelection — 25 Republicans and 19 Democrats.   5. Does Trump pursue any kind of legislative agenda?   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks to members of the media as he leaves the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 17, 2025.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Trump got a spending package through Congress in 2025 that he labeled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" But is that it? Will there be any other legislative accomplishments from this president?   \n   That isn't clear, and working with lawmakers certainly hasn't been a priority. This president, with an acquiescent Republican-controlled Congress, has instead worked to centralize power in the White House. He's exercised that power through executive actions, publicly pressuring universities, law firms and the media, and pushing the limits of what's legal on both the domestic and international stages.   But, as past presidents have found, the road to a lasting legacy runs through the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House — in the U.S. Capitol.   6. What about what the president will try to do on his own?   Two areas in which Trump has acted without Congress — and will likely continue to — are foreign policy and immigration.   That includes boat strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific, threats against Venezuela, and false starts on peace attempts in Ukraine and a tenuous ceasefire in the Middle East.   In the new year, just how far is Trump willing to go on regime change in Venezuela? Do these boat strikes continue, will there be more bombings inside the country itself, could there be retaliation, and will Congress try to exert authority and draw any lines to rein in the president's unilateral action?   \n   Domestically, does the Trump administration continue with its draconian immigration and deportation policies? The president's approval on immigration has slumped, though it's better than most other issues. Majorities have been saying in polls that the administration's approach to deportations is too harsh or doing too much.   7. Does Congress do anything on health care?   One of those less-grand, but-still-important legislative items is health care. Trump continues to promise health care that would be better than \"Obamacare,\" but nothing has come to fruition in the decade Trump has been on the political scene.   \n   The government shut down this past fall over those Affordable Care Act subsidies. The avenue back to reopening was through a compromise struck between moderate Democrats and Republican leaders to allow a vote on ACA subsidies.   But that bill and others did not pass. With people on the precipice of skyrocketing premiums, will Trump push for a fix, especially in an election year when costs are already the top issue for voters?   8. Does the government shut down again (and who gets the blame)?   If nothing passes on the subsidies, how far are Democrats willing to take it? Will they shut the government down again to try and force a compromise? Will voters blame them or Republicans? And how will Democratic base voters perceive their willingness to fight?   \n   9. Will Democratic base voters rally around the party?   This is a key question for whether Democrats take back control of at least the House in this year's elections. Democratic voters in 2025 were unconvinced about the party's leadership.   \n   Routinely, the Democratic Party and Democrats in Congress score lower with voters than Republicans, and that's because of Democrats. Democrats have been far less likely to say they approve of the job their party is doing than Republicans.   Despite that, Democrats did very well in elections in 2025, an indicator that Democratic voters' intense disapproval of the president and GOP may trump their lack of confidence in their own party.   10. How do Democratic candidates model their campaigns?   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani stands on stage with his wife, Rama Duwaji, after he was ceremonially sworn in as New York City's 112th mayor at City Hall on Thursday.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Will campaigns look more like the self-declared democratic socialist Mayor of New York Zohran Mamdani or Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger?   It really is a false choice, as none other than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told MSNBC after the 2025 elections that saw both Mamdani and Spanberger win.   \"I don't think that our party needs to have one face,\" she said. \"Our country does not have one face. It's about all of us as a team together, and we all understand the assignment. Our assignment everywhere is to send the strongest fighters for the working class wherever possible. In some places, like Virginia, for the gubernatorial seat, that's going to look like Abigail Spanberger. In New York City, unequivocally, it is Zohran Mamdani.\"   But expect Republicans to try to tie every Democrat to Mamdani, at the very least to fire up their base — though it's not clear how much that will work anymore, considering Trump's unexpectedly effusive praise of the then-incoming New York mayor at a joint Oval Office meeting.   11. Do any Cabinet members exit?    It's not unusual to see turnover in the White House and executive branch. In fact, a lack of it would be odd.   \n   Consider that, in the four years of Trump's first term, he ran through four chiefs of staff and — whether acting or confirmed — four different defense secretaries and four secretaries of state.   Names that have reportedly been on the hot seat at various points in 2025 include Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (the administration refers to him as secretary of war), as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The president has, so far, stood by them, though.   12. How does the redistricting arms race shake out?   A huge key to control of Congress is going to be how mid-decade redistricting settles. Because of how districts are drawn, there are fewer and fewer competitive seats — even less so since 2018 when Republicans lost 40 seats with Trump in the White House.   \n   The margin in the House is razor thin, so every seat is going to matter. Recognizing this, Trump took the extraordinary step of trying to get red states to carve out more GOP-leaning targets. He's had mixed success.   Republicans will likely tilt a few more seats in their direction, but it could have been worse for Democrats. And Democrats have had surprising success in countering GOP initiatives. That's particularly true of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who got his state's voters to temporarily nix a requirement that the state draw districts by independent commission. That will likely result in a handful of more Democratic seats.   It was a major victory for Newsom, someone who very much has his eyes on 2028.   13. How do candidates begin to position for 2028?   Believe it or not, 2026 will be the year that those 2028 presidential rumblings start.   Keep an eye on who starts making trips to Iowa and New Hampshire. There's a long list of names of Republicans who want to fill the void that will be left by Trump when he leaves, and an equally long — if not longer — line of Democrats who want to sell their post-Trump vision for America.   \n   Remember this will be the first open presidential election in a dozen years and likely the first without a Trump, Biden, Clinton or Bush on the ballot in more than 30 years. And it was in October of 2006 when Barack Obama went on NBC's Meet the Press, changed his mind and opened the door to a run in 2008.   So who knows what will happen or who will emerge, but the jockeying has already begun.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump discusses his health after spending the 2024 campaign knocking President Biden as old.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Over the past year, President Trump has regularly appeared with makeup on the back of his right hand. He's also talked about getting an MRI, and he has appeared to nod off during meetings. Trump will turn 80 this year. He is the oldest person ever to have assumed the presidency. So all this has raised questions about his health. In a new interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump faced those questions head-on. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to talk about it. Hey, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.KELLY: What did we learn from the Wall Street Journal interview?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump addressed all those points you mentioned, like the makeup on the hand, which is often plainly visible. Trump said that it's because he bruises easily because of the aspirin he takes. On that note, we learned that he takes 325 milligrams per day of aspirin. Now, that's high. It's common for people to take a low dose of 81 milligrams as a blood thinner to ward off things like heart attacks and strokes. So Trump is taking four times that much. He said his doctors have told him to ease off a bit, but Trump said he doesn't want thick blood, as he put it, going through his veins.KELLY: And what about the MRI he has talked about undergoing? That, of course, raised questions as to why he might have needed an MRI. Do we know?KURTZLEBEN: Well, he now says it was, in fact, a CT scan. Trump apparently had just gotten the name of the test wrong, and his doctor said it was to rule out heart issues. Really, altogether in this interview, Trump comes off as pretty defensive. He's annoyed to be talking about his health, and he's insistent that he's in great health. Speaking of which, Trump, this morning, posted that he had aced a recent cognitive test. Now, he's talked about those types of tests for years as evidence that he's still sharp. I asked the White House today for more information on that test, and I haven't heard back.KELLY: OK. I mean, it's hard not to notice that here is Donald Trump facing scrutiny for the exact same thing that he slammed Joe Biden for on the campaign trail - showing his age.KURTZLEBEN: Exactly. Trump called Biden Sleepy Joe throughout the campaign and attacked him relentlessly for aging. Here was Trump at a rally making fun of Biden for sleeping on the beach during vacation...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But he has an ability that I wish I had. He's able to fall asleep, stone cold out, in front of the media. They're taking a picture. Who the hell wants to sleep in front of the media? I wish I had the ability to sleep like that.KURTZLEBEN: ...Which definitely emphasizes all the more that, yeah, Trump has now appeared to nod off a couple of times during long meetings. Now, for his part, Trump insisted to the journal that in those clips, he's just relaxing by closing his eyes.KELLY: I mean, bottom line, Danielle, is there anything particularly worrying here? Given what we know about Trump's age, his health - anything worrying about his ability to do the job of president?KURTZLEBEN: Well, you know, you do have those potential naps during meetings, but while there are those types of signs, it's just hard to talk about anybody's health without speculating. I mean, in the Journal's write-up, they note that Trump veers from topic to topic as he talks and also that he sometimes makes factual errors - their words. Those are signs that a lot of people associate with aging, and there's a lot of evidence of that because Trump just appears publicly a lot. Many days, he brings the press pool into the Oval Office. But with Trump, it's hard to say how much of that is really age-related, as he's done both of those things since even he first ran for president in 2016. He has long bragged about doing what he calls the weave, jumping from topic to topic. And as for factual errors...KELLY: Right.KURTZLEBEN: ...I mean, he does have flubs, which may or may not be age-related, but for his entire political career, he has said many lies and falsehoods. So really, if you zoom out, he has changed some over the years.KELLY: Right.KURTZLEBEN: That's no surprise, but he insists that his genes are keeping him healthy.KELLY: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, thanks.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      After vetoing bipartisan bills, President Trump says he doesn't want to deal with Congress. Michel Martin asks Jessica Taylor of the Cook Political Report about Trump's relationship with lawmakers.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  On Monday, Congress returns to work and a new year navigating its relationship with President Trump. Trump's recent vetoes and his rejection of congressional input on the attacks near and in Venezuela raise questions about what this relationship is going to be going forward. We called Jessica Taylor to talk about this. She's the Senate and governor's editor at the Cook Political Report. Welcome, good morning, and Happy New Year.JESSICA TAYLOR: Happy New Year, Michel.MARTIN: So let's start with those two vetoes - that water pipeline project and a measure granting more tribal control in part of the Everglades. What message is the president sending?TAYLOR: I think he's saying that if you don't bend to my will, then there is retribution in this. He can cite fiscal concerns, but you look at just his post on Truth Social and things, and as the previous reporter outlined, you know, he's upset at the Democratic governor there in Colorado, Jared Polis. He wants Tina Peters, who's a local election official, released. He's tried to pardon her on a federal level, but she's in jail for state crimes related to the 2020 election. She's an election conspiracy theorist. You know, you look at the Florida veto, and they've - this tribe has opposed because they say that the Alligator Alcatraz is on their lands and different things. And so he's saying that, you know, even things that are passed by a voice vote of Congress, to me, the question is whether leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, who has been such a staunch Trump ally, will bring this up for a veto override. Can they...MARTIN: And that's my question to you. What do you think?TAYLOR: It would be a notable break by Johnson. You know, we've seen these Epstein files being brought to the floor by a discharge petition when leadership didn't want to bring them up. And so you see members starting to break, but we haven't seen Speaker Johnson break in that same regard. Now, we have seen leaders in the Senate stand up to President Trump. For instance, he's wanted them to do away with the filibuster, and Senate Leader John Thune has said that's a nonstarter because they realize that were they in the minority, then that does away with crucial protections.So, you know, Trump wants to bend Congress to his will, but there are still - we are seeing members, like Lauren Boebert, there that are staunch allies stand up to him. I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene, that used to be one of his biggest supporters, has come out against him, and now she's leaving Congress as a result.MARTIN: But - so that's my question, though. So she's, like, I would think the most high-profile person who has been a strong supporter, broke with the president, but now she's leaving. So what's the takeaway for Republicans in Congress? I mean, I also think about Elise Stefanik, the New York congresswoman, who was in leadership. She was supposed to become U.N. ambassador. Her nomination was pulled because the president feared that there was this thin...TAYLOR: Right.MARTIN: ...Margin, too thin of a majority. She was supposed to run for governor, and now she's leaving, too. So what's the takeaway here?TAYLOR: The takeaway is that if you bug President Trump, then he's going to support a primary challenge against you in that regard. That was Marjorie Taylor Greene. I mean, and Elise Stefanik wasn't getting Trump's endorsement, despite the fac that she transformed from - she used to work for Paul Ryan. She was definitely not a MAGA person at the beginning, but she transformed. Trump's loyalty is a one-way street, really. That's what we see. You know, I'm also looking at people like Thom Tillis in the Senate. You know, he wasn't going to back the One Big Beautiful Bill over a concern for Medicaid. Trump was going to support a primary challenge to him, and he decided to retire instead. And I think, as a result, that seat is much more vulnerable for Republicans right now.MARTIN: Is there anything that could change the dynamic between lawmakers and the president?TAYLOR: I think that Trump as we get closer to the midterm election, he seems to be getting more nervous about the very real possibility and I think the likelihood of losing the House, at least, because you see what he's trying to do in redistricting. But again, we see state lawmakers in Indiana that stood up to him that did not pass that bill, that he wants these things as a protection. But there's a very real likelihood, I think, that come this time next year, that there's going to be a Democratic Congress that are going to levy their subpoena power, have investigations and different things. I think the Senate is still much harder. But he wants to sort of bend Congress as much to his will while it's a Republican majority. I think he knows that the last two years of his term could be really difficult if Democrats are in power.MARTIN: That's Jessica Taylor. She's the Senate and governor's editor with the Cook Political Report. Jessica, thank you.TAYLOR: Thanks, Michel.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He rejected two bills that passed Congress with bipartisan support. One bill would have given the Miccosukee Tribe greater control over tribal lands in Florida. The tribe had joined a lawsuit over the immigration detention center known as Alligator Alcatraz. The other vetoed bill would have helped pay for a $1 billion pipeline to deliver clean drinking water in rural Colorado. In each case, the president cited fiscal concerns. Others see political retribution. NPR's Huo Jingnan reports on the pipeline bill.HUO JINGNAN, BYLINE: President Trump says he didn't like the price tag for the Arkansas River Valley conduit. In his letter to Congress, Trump writes that he is ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts and restoring fiscal sanity. But many have noted the benefits the pipeline has over surface and groundwater, which is the region's current source of tap water. Here's Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert introducing the bill on the House floor.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LAUREN BOEBERT: Naturally occurring elements are found in the surface and groundwater in southeastern Colorado, and the water quality is problematic year-round.HUO: She says this project, which started in the '60s, would make clean water more accessible. Boebert told local television station 9News that the veto might be a form of retaliation.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BOEBERT: The president never promised that there would be retribution for me taking a stand and holding corrupt individuals accountable on the Epstein list.HUO: Boebert has been the president's ally, but she also recently bucked his wishes and voted to make public documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Here she is talking to 9News again.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BOEBERT: We're talking about Southeast Colorado, who's overwhelmingly voted for President Trump in the last three elections. And these are not the people that should be attacked.HUO: NPR asked the White House about Boebert's accusations, and the White House only pointed to the president's letter. But then, Boebert isn't the only official in Colorado that has done things the president didn't like. For example, the president has called the Democratic governor, Jared Polis, a scumbag for not releasing Tina Peters from prison. Peters is a former county official convicted of charges related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Polis said in a statement that the veto of the water pipeline bill is disappointing and that they will continue to fight for the project. It is unclear whether Congress will try to override the president's veto.Huo Jingnan, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A video and nearly 300 pages offer insights into Smith's cases against Trump and what the rarely seen lawyer thought about Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Here's NPR's Luke Garrett.LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Smith led two probes. One focused on Trump's attempt to overthrow the 2020 election results, and the second on Trump's handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. Smith resigned in the final weeks of the Biden administration, and his cases against Trump were dropped after the president won in 2024. But during his December deposition, Smith gave a full-throated defense of his election case against Trump.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACK SMITH: President Trump was, by a large measure, the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy. The - these crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol as part of this case does not happen without him.GARRETT: Smith also disputed claims that his investigation and conclusions were political.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SMITH: I entirely disagree with any characterization that our work was in any way meant to hamper him in the presidential election.GARRETT: Smith said he believes his case would have led to a conviction and told the committee how.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SMITH: Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party.GARRETT: During his deposition, the committee questioned Smith's collection of Senate phone records. Smith confirmed this but said they were only timestamps of calls between lawmakers and Trump aides in and around the January 6 attack and not the contents of the call. Smith also pointed to Trump for directing the calls in the first place.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SMITH: These records are people - in the case of the senators, Donald Trump directed his co-conspirators to call these people to further delay the proceedings. He chose to do that.GARRETT: The analysis of phone toll records is a common investigative tactic, but there are ongoing debates about whether the DOJ should be able to use this against a sitting member of Congress. Smith stood firm by his investigation into Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. But when it came to his investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents, Smith said little. He said he's open to share more, but is barred from doing so by order of a federal judge.Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In it, Roosevelt built on the Monroe Doctrine, which was formulated originally by President James Monroe to warn European powers away from interfering in the region.   Roosevelt, who himself fought against Spain in Cuba in 1898, expanded that doctrine to assert a U.S. right to act unilaterally as a regional policeman — using military force to reinforce diplomatic pressure to advance its interests.   \n   Following World War II, and especially since the Cuban Revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in Havana, that focus shifted primarily to stopping what Washington said was the potential spread of communism in the region.   \"During the Cold War, intervention was mostly covert. In the 1980s, you begin to see more overt actions,\" says Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.   U.S. policy in the region was one of strategic denial, Gamarra says. That meant deterring non-American actors in the region.   \"In the 1800s, that meant Europeans; in the 20th century, especially after World War II, it meant the Soviet Union,\" he says.   \n   This led to a shared post-World War II notion between the U.S. and many right-wing governments in Latin America that communism \"was not indigenous to the Americas,\" says Edward Murphy, a professor of history at Michigan State University. \"They justified this through the logic of the Monroe Doctrine, because this was a foreign ideology that needed to be extirpated from the Americas.\"   By the mid-1980s, the U.S. \"transitioned from the Cold War to the drug war\" in the region, according to Gamarra.   U.S. policy, underpinned by the Monroe Doctrine, has shaped the region in the decades since World War II, leading to overt and covert interventions that have often — but not always — resulted in bad outcomes and unintended consequences.   \n   Here are five examples:   The overthrow of Guatemala's government   By 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was concerned about a Guatemalan land-reform program that nationalized property owned by the U.S.-based United Fruit Company (now Chiquita Brands International). The initiative was carried out under Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz, the nation's second democratically elected leader, whose term began in 1951. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles accused Árbenz of establishing what he described as a \"communist-type reign of terror.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Indigenous women beg in Guatemala in June 2004 in front of a propaganda mural that speaks against U.S. interventions in the region.\n                \n                    Orlando Sierra/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Orlando Sierra/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S., Gamarra says, \"responded by undermining Árbenz and supporting a military coup.\"   The CIA launched a successful covert plan of psychological warfare designed to destabilize the Árbenz government while backing a coup to topple it. Coup leader Carlos Castillo Armas, who came to power after Árbenz, was the first in a series of brutal U.S.-backed authoritarians to rule Guatemala before civilian rule returned in the mid-1980s.   \n   The U.S. overthrow of Árbenz emboldened right-wing elements in the country to engage in a campaign of repression, Murphy says. \"What the overthrow of Árbenz really did was fortify illiberal forces in Guatemala.\"   Murphy says what happened in Guatemala became a model for other repressive right-wing governments in the region, such as Chile, to follow.   The Bay of Pigs invasion   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Fidel Castro's soldiers at Playa de Giron, Cuba, after thwarting the ill-fated U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.\n                \n                    Graf/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Graf/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n    \n\n   \n   Shortly after taking office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy approved a covert plan to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who had grown increasingly aligned with the Soviet Union since seizing power two years earlier. The secret operation, originally developed under the Eisenhower administration, relied on a force of about 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles who were expected to seize the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's southern coast and spark a popular uprising against Castro.   \n   Instead, the Bay of Pigs invasion ended in disaster. Castro ordered some 20,000 troops to the beach, forcing most of the U.S.-backed invasion force to surrender. More than 100 were killed. The incident became a major embarrassment for the United States.   The Bay of Pigs convinced Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that the United States would attempt another invasion of Cuba. Castro convinced Khrushchev he needed Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba to deter further U.S. aggression, precipitating the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The resulting confrontation over the missiles brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war before Kennedy and Khrushchev worked out a delicate compromise that averted a direct conflict between the two superpowers.   \n   It was an extreme Cold War confrontation that came close to a nuclear catastrophe, Gamarra says. The long-term consequences, he says, resulted in \"a misguided embargo that hasn't changed the regime and instead consolidated Cuba's relationship with the Soviet Union and now Russia.\"   The U.S. invasion of Grenada   By 1983, the southern Caribbean island of Grenada was undergoing a period of political instability after the 1979 overthrow of Prime Minister Eric Gairy by Maurice Bishop, a socialist leader aligned with Cuba and the Soviet Union.   \n   \"Cuba was making inroads across the Caribbean,\" Gamarra says.   President Ronald Reagan's White House was suspicious of Havana's involvement in the construction of a large international airport in Grenada, which had only gained independence from Britain in 1974.   In its first major combat deployment since the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. forces landed on Oct. 25, 1983, as part of Operation Urgent Fury. Reagan cited regional security concerns and the need to protect U.S. medical students attending the island's St. George's University School of Medicine as justification for intervention.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. soldiers arrest suspected Marxist activist in St. George's, the capital of the Grenada Island, on Oct. 30, 1983, three days after American forces invaded the island, ousting the Marxist government.\n                \n                    AFP/via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AFP/via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Although U.S. forces encountered stronger resistance and more logistical difficulties than expected, military operations took only a few days. The U.S. helped install a provisional government and elections were held in 1984.   Since then, Grenada has experienced stable, democratic governance, with elections and peaceful transfers of power. Today, it is generally regarded as more politically stable than most of its Caribbean neighbors.   U.S. support for the Nicaraguan Contras   After decades of U.S. support for the oppressive and corrupt Somoza family that ruled Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza was overthrown in 1979 during a popular uprising led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Daniel Ortega, a committed Marxist at the time and prominent FSLN leader, assumed control of the government.   President Reagan opposed the Sandinistas and in 1981 issued a covert directive for U.S. aid to support a group of anti-Sandinista insurgents known as the Contras.   In 1982, the U.S. Congress passed the Boland Amendment to block U.S. support for the Contras. Despite these restrictions, the Reagan administration secretly continued aiding the group through a scheme that illegally sold weapons to Iran and funneled the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. When the operation was exposed, it became one of the most significant scandals of Reagan's presidency: the Iran-Contra affair.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, former aide to National Security Adviser John Poindexter, is sworn in on July 7, 1987, before the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan Contra rebels.\n                \n                    Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"The Contra war was devastating — socially, economically, and politically,\" says Murphy.   \n   Despite efforts to topple him, Ortega remained in power and won a decisive electoral victory in 1984. He lost in 1990 to Violeta Chamorro, a wealthy, U.S.-educated newspaper owner who served as president until 1997.   \"In the end, it was … soft power that led to the Sandinistas' loss in the elections and the victory by Chamorro,\" Gamarra notes.   Subsequently, Ortega's political stance evolved away from Marxism, and he won elections in 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021. Today Ortega is president of Nicaragua along with his wife, co-President Rosario Murillo.   Murphy says it's a different Ortega now — one that \"looks more like a Somoza government than a Sandinista government because it's a family dictatorship.\"   Ortega and Murillo, who Murphy calls \"the power behind the throne,\" have \"followed almost to the letter what Somoza was doing.\"   The U.S. invasion of Panama   Although brutal and corrupt, Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega was useful to the U.S. in the 1980s, due to the de facto leader's cooperation with the CIA in providing a base of operations for the Contras in Nicaragua.   But Noriega's drug trafficking, which included a relationship with notorious Colombian narcotrafficker Pablo Escobar, soon transformed him into a net liability for the U.S. By 1986, mounting evidence of his ties to drug cartels, extrajudicial killings and selling of U.S. secrets to Eastern European governments was an embarrassment. In 1988, federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa indicted Noriega on racketeering, drug smuggling and money laundering charges.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Panamian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, right, fakes a punch to a supporter on May 2, 1989, at the laying of the foundation of a group home in the neighborhood of Panama City where boxer Roberto Duran was born. Months later, Noriega would be driven from power by a U.S. invasion of Panama.\n                \n                    Manoocher Degahti/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Manoocher Degahti/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The following year, President George H.W. Bush took office. Bush was briefly CIA director in the 1970s, when Noriega was considered a valuable intelligence asset. But in 1989, Bush decided that Noriega needed to go. The administration backed a failed coup attempt in October. But two months later, Bush launched Operation Just Cause, an invasion by 20,000 U.S. troops that ultimately overthrew Noriega and took him into U.S. custody.   \n   Since Noriega's ouster, Panama has maintained a stable democracy with regular, peaceful elections and significant economic growth.   Gamarra says Panama is a rare example of a successful American intervention in the region. \"We went in there, we got rid of Manuel Noriega,\" he says.   \"We had a clear exit plan, which is not something the U.S. is very good at anywhere else,\" Gamarra says, referring to the emphasis on capturing Noriega in a quick and limited military operation. Today, he says, \"at least in terms of its economic system, [Panama] is still extraordinarily successful.\"   However, Murphy is less sanguine.   \"I don't think the invasion is responsible for anything positive that comes later,\" he says, \"other than the fact that Noriega was no longer in power.\"\n",

At the start of 2026, many people agree — and believe that he is now one of the powerful few keeping the public in the dark.    In the two weeks since the Justice Department failed to fully meet a legal deadline to release its expansive tranche of files on Jeffrey Epstein, old conspiracy theories about his life and death have subsided and new ones have taken shape. The late financier was a convicted sex offender and accused of sex trafficking minors while associating with top figures in politics, academia and other influential industries.   \n   Both supporters of the president and his opponents have criticized the rollout of documents, often heavily redacted and shared without any clear organization or context. Included in the roughly 40,000 pages of new information published in the last week are unvetted tips from the public — and a complaint made to the FBI more than a decade before Epstein was first criminally charged.    There could be well over a million files still unreleased, along with potentially terabytes-worth of data seized from Epstein's devices and estate, according to 2020 emails between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York included in the most recent batch of files.   On Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on social media that lawyers were working \"around the clock\" to review documents but did not specify the scope or scale of the remaining work.   \"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" Blanche said. \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released. The Attorney General's and this Administration's goal is simple: transparency and protecting victims.\"   \n   A bipartisan group of lawmakers is threatening to take action against the Justice Department for failing to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed in November, but the law itself contains no penalties or enforcement mechanism.    Politically, the Epstein files saga caps off a rocky first year for an administration facing record-low favorability ratings and a president whose grasp on his base is appearing to slip. Trump spent most of 2025 downplaying the significance of the files, at times lashing out against Republicans who demanded the release of information about other potential perpetrators.   \n   Congress' demands to release the files are unusual   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jeffrey Epstein abuse survivor Danielle Bensky and National Director of World Without Exploitation Lauren Hersh embrace after receiving word that the U.S. Senate unanimously approved passage of the House's Epstein Files Transparency Act on Capitol Hill on Nov. 18, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave a deadline of Dec. 19 for the disclosure of \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorneys' Offices.\"   Congress gave limited exemptions for redacting and withholding files, including identifying information, photos and videos of victims, child sexual abuse materials and images that depict death, physical abuse or injury.   The law also allows the attorney general to withhold or redact anything classified \"in the interest of national defense or foreign policy\" or details that would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary.\"   It is highly unusual for federal law enforcement to release the entirety of its investigative file for a case, even one that has garnered heavy public interest — let alone be directed to do so by Congress.   The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, for example, is a 16-page law that set out a 25-year timeline for the release of records related to his assassination, and established a review board to identify relevant records with explicit guidelines and directions. Similarly, the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act of 1998 and Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000 set out a process for evaluating and releasing more than 8.5 million pages.   More recently, presidents have used executive orders to release files related to high-profile events. Former President Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 leading the FBI and DOJ to declassify and release roughly 4,000 files related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump's January 2025 executive orders related to the assassinations of JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. led to the release of close to 400,000 pages.   The 2025 Epstein law is less detailed in its requests and does not provide any additional funding for the Justice Department to complete the process of reviewing and releasing the files.   \n   What we know about the files made public   The vast majority of the roughly 250,000 documents that are now available about Epstein are from public court dockets, Freedom of Information Act requests from state and federal agencies, and records turned over to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate.   That includes communications between Epstein and a vast web of influential figures in politics, academia, business and more, even after he registered as a sex offender.   \n   Trump, who had a decades-long friendship with Epstein before a falling out in the early 2000s, is mentioned frequently in both old and new Epstein files by Epstein himself. Trump has not been credibly accused of wrongdoing in connection to Epstein's alleged crimes.   In one newly released email from 2020, a prosecutor whose name is redacted flags that \"Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).\" At the same time, Epstein's own emails reveal a near-obsession with Trump's presidency and mock his time in office.   One email sent by federal agents after Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex-trafficking minors mentioned 10 possible co-conspirators, including Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex-trafficking minors and other charges. Most of the other names on that list are redacted.   Some emails released in the files detail challenges that federal prosecutors faced obtaining, processing and organizing more than a million documents taken from Epstein's estates, as well as more than 60 devices and other evidence accumulated in the investigation into Epstein and Maxwell.   What we don't know about the remaining files   The Justice Department hasn't indicated how many files remain, how many will be released or whether any information it does release will be factually accurate.   Some of the investigative files released in the last two weeks include unverified fantastical claims about Trump, Epstein and others, including a fake video purporting to show Epstein's death by suicide in his federal prison cell. There was also a forged letter that appeared to be from Epstein to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar that alleged Trump shared a \"love of young, nubile girls.\"   \n   The Justice Department posted on social media last week that the Nassar letter was fake, citing inconsistencies with handwriting and other aspects of its construction.   \"This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual,\" the DOJ X account stated.   Before the president's second term, Trump and top allies like now-FBI Director Kash Patel amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein and his death, which were embraced by their supporters.   Trump's about-face on releasing the files and the trickle of information have spawned new conspiracy theories by some Trump opponents who have seized on salacious and unverified claims released in the document dump. Others have shared previously published redacted court filings out of context to claim that the administration is doctoring files to benefit Trump.   There are also several types of files that lawmakers and victims of Epstein's abuse say exist and should be made public. California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna said on NPR's All Things Considered last week that FBI witness interviews are among those he is looking for.    \"I know from survivors and survivors' lawyers that when they had these conversations with FBI agents, they specifically named other men who they were trafficked to or who showed up at the island or who covered up for this abuse,\" Khanna said. \"There were lawyers of the survivors present there. There are dozens of these interview memorandums. The DOJ has not released a single one.\"   What's next in the Epstein saga?   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Reps. Thomas Massie, R-K.Y. (center); speaks alongside Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., during a news conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 18, 2025.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   It's unclear what steps Congress may take to try to compel faster or more complete production of files from the Justice Department, or if Khanna and others follow through on proposed \"inherent contempt\" proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi. Lawmakers have been on recess for the holidays and return to Washington next week.   \n   Trump himself continues to fan the flames, including in a Dec. 26 Truth Social post where he appeared to suggest the Justice Department should focus on releasing names of Democrats mentioned in the files and move on.   \"When do they say NO MORE, and work on Election Fraud etc.,\" Trump wrote. \"The Dems are the ones who worked with Epstein, not the Republicans. Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country! The Radical Left doesn't want people talking about TRUMP & REPUBLICAN SUCCESS, only a long ago dead Jeffrey Epstein - Just another Witch Hunt!!!\"   But the dump of files is expected to continue, as the tail of the political fallout grows longer heading into the 2026 midterm elections in November. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is set to resign from the House Jan. 5 after Trump repeatedly attacked her over her lobbying to release the files, shrinking an already-tenuous majority for House Republicans.

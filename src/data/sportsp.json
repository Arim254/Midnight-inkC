However, the SportsLine model has the Mountaineers covering the 20.5-point spread as one of its Friday best bets. It expects multiple underdogs to have competitive evenings, with Colorado State (+5.5) vs. San Diego State and Western Kentucky defeating Delaware at +120 odds among its Friday best bets at DraftKings.

Western Kentucky ranks 16th in the country in passing yards (302 yards per game) while throwing on 58.02% of plays, the 14th-highest pass-play percentage in the nation. Senior quarterback Maverick McIvor threw for 317 yards in a 27-22 win over Missouri State last week. Delaware is allowing 29.3 points per game, which ranks 90th in college football. Western Kentucky has three receivers with more than 230 yards and three running backs with more than 150 rushing yards, making the Hilltoppers a challenging team to gameplan against. The model projects Western Kentucky to win in 66% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds in a 7 p.m. start on CBS Sports Network.</p><h2>West Virginia (+20.5) vs. BYU (-115)</h2><p>The Mountaineers are coming off back-to-back lopsided losses, but the model doesn't expect that trend to continue against BYU. West Virginia is one of the most run-heavy teams in college football, rushing on 60.55% of plays. That is the 17th-most in college football, which is similar to how the offense was run during Rich Rodriguez's first tenure as head coach at the university. The Mountaineers' rushing attack is starting to come together with a roster filled with transfer portal players learning Rodriguez's system for the first time, as West Virginia rushed for 261 yards last week, raising its average to 172.3 rushing yards per game. If West Virginia can control the time of possession, it can keep this game within a few scores to cover the margin. The model projects West Virginia to cover the spread in 64% of simulations.</p><h2>Colorado State (+5.5) vs. San Diego State (-108)</h2><p>Colorado State is 1-3 overall this season, but the Rams are 2-0 against the spread as underdogs this year. Colorado State has one of the better pass defenses in the nation, ranking 40th in passing yards against (196 yards per game) and with San Diego State averaging just 145.7 passing yards per game, 123rd in college football, the Colorado State defense could make enough stands to keep this contest close. Colorado State defeated San Diego State, 22-19, in their last meeting in 2023, and the model projects the Rams to cover the spread in 68% of simulations heading into this 10:30 p.m. ET matchup on CBS Sports Network.</p><h2>Want more college football picks for Friday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Friday best bets.

Nonetheless, Western Kentucky quarterback Maverick McIvor has thrown for 1,474 passing yards with 11 touchdowns. This season, the Hilltoppers are 4-1 ATS in all games, and Delaware is 0-1 ATS as the home favorite. SportsLine's model has the Hilltoppers going on the road and covering the spread in 69% of simulations. </p><h2>West Virginia (+20.5) vs. BYU (-114)</h2><p>The Mountaineers are 2-0 against BYU all-time, but head into this game as massive underdogs. The Cougars have allowed more points defensively each week, which could lead to West Virginia keeping this one closer than people expect. BYU allowed 172 rushing yards last week against Colorado, and that could be an area that West Virginia attacks to keep the Cougars' offense off the field.

The Spartans have picked up offensively, tallying at least 28 points in back-to-back games. Receiver Danny Scudero has 33 catches for 514 receiving yards and three touchdowns for the Spartans.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Throughout the years, I've been often surprised by how many handicappers attack the weekly slate of games looking for all sorts of angles and trends, many of them statistically-based, as they seek clues for the upcoming card. That's fine, but it should probably be accompanied by a simple measurable that can prove most beneficial to handicapping the upcoming slate of games, yet often overlooked. </p><p>I have long believed that before tackling the weekly slate, a quick review of how teams are performing vs. the spread, specifically an easy-to-use list of current spread streaks, win and lose, should be the first step in scoping the weekly card. </p><p>Why? Identifying just a handful of streaking point spread teams, win or loss, early in their ascents or descents, can often make the difference between a winning and losing season for the handicapper. There's nothing better than pegging a streak and riding that trend for as long as it lasts.</p><p>Invariably, there are several of those spread streaks each season -- the key as always is to identify them early enough to take advantage.  Every five-or-six-game spread streak was once a one or two-game, streak. This is why we like to identify all teams on as brief as a two-game win streak vs. the spread, as the next teams to reach three, four, five, six, seven or more spread covers in a row are always embedded in that grouping. </p><p>Into October, we have a good enough sampling of games to begin charting these streaks on a weekly basis.  Here are the current point spread streaks heading into this weekend's action. </p><h3>Point spread win streaks</h3><p><strong>5:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\"

and distorted final scores, we can effectively introduce Away From Spread (\"AFS\") calculations to this weekly offering.  As noted earlier, what AFS analysis strives to accomplish is identifying potential soft spots, both for good and bad, for teams that are either being underrated, or overrated, by the oddsmakers.  By measuring results away from the point spread, we can get a better feel of how accurately the oddsmakers, and by extension the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">college football betting</a></span> marketplace, are rating these teams. </p><p>This calculation is a further refinement and goes beyond the basic spread win/loss records (and accompanying streaks), which remain  are the most important measurable every week. Yet a team that wins back-to-back games by, say, 21 points as a 7-point favorite in each contest can be said to be overachieving vs. expectation; by landing +14 points from the spread each week over both games in a two-week span, said team is +28 points ATS across that span, or +14 per week.  Conversely, a 7-point underdog on consecutive weeks that loses each game by 21 points would be -28 ATS across that span, or -14 per week -- significantly underachieving against the spread. </p><p>As with any such calculation, finding appropriate parameters is important.  We have found over the years that a two-week running average is often the best indicator of what might happen in the next game; a three-week average, though potentially more revealing, also stretches back a bit further and values results equally from two games before.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season is relatively short, and history has shown us that the sooner to potentially identify these trailing AFS numbers, the better, and the two-game average is a more immediate reflection of form than a three-game average. </p><p>Of course, the two-game average is open to more distortions by a particularly lopsided score, so what we have done in this calculation is note teams (accompanied by an asterisk) that have had at least one of their past two results land 21 points or more away from the spread.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana's</a> recent 63-10 thrashing of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> is one such example. That was a result so lopsided it will obviously mandate that each side is in any such two-week calculation, so we simply note that distorted score line in the listings. It's worth noting that both the Hoosiers and Fighting Illini reversed the spread results in their games following the 63-10 blowout (Indiana faied to cover vs. Iowa, Illinois won and covered vs. USC). Thus, teams can appear on the \"+\" side of the two-week running average that might have lost a point spread decision within that span, just as a team on the \"-\" side might have a spread win. Though, as always, view these and other measurables with a degree of discretion. </p><p>The new AFS calculation still includes a handful of mismatch results vs. FCS foes, games that are about to disappear from the upcoming schedules.  As we didn't want to wait any longer to begin noting the weekly AFS numbers, some FBS teams are still going to have recorded AFS results vs. FCS-level teams.  Moving forward, the results vs. FCS teams will almost universally drop off from any two-week AFS calculation. </p><p>Thus, following are updated AFS lists, both on the plus (+) and minus (-) sides, using a running two-game average of at least 7 or more points from the spread for inclusion.  As noted above, a team with at least one distorting result of 21 or more points away from the spread, win or lose,  is accompanied by an asterisk.</p><h3>AFS + </h3><ul><li>San Diego State +24.50*</li><li>Indiana +21.00* </li><li>New Mexico +21.00*</li><li> Western Michigan +20.25*</li><li> Duke +19.50*</li><li>Notre Dame +19.50*</li><li>Delaware +19.00*</li><li> Ole Miss +17.50*</li><li> Texas tech +17.25*</li><li>Michigan +17.00*</li><li>Cincinnati +15.00</li><li>Miami-Fla +15.00</li><li>Virginia +13.25</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a> +13.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ODU/old-dominion-monarchs/\">Old Dominion</a> +12.50*</li><li> Memphis +11.50</li><li>Louisiana Tech +11.00</li><li> ULM +11.00</li><li>James Madison +10.50</li><li>Utah State +10.50</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> +9.00</li><li>Central Michigan +8,75</li><li> South Carolina +8.75</li><li>Ball State +8.50</li><li>Boise State +8.50</li><li>Hawaii +8.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MOST/missouri-state-bears/\">Missouri State</a> +8.00</li><li>Rice +7.75</li><li>Miami-Ohio +7.00</li></ul><h3>AFS - </h3><ul><li>Arkansas -23.00*</li><li>West Virginia -19.50</li><li> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CAL/california-golden-bears/\">California</a> -19.00*</li><li>Illinois -19.00*</li><li>Clemson -18.50*</li><li>Georgia State -18.50</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> -18.00*</li><li> Appalachian State -17.75</li><li> Boston College -17.00</li><li>South Alabama -16.75*</li><li>New Mexico State -13.25</li><li> UTEP -13.25</li><li> Sam Houston -12.75</li><li> Arkansas State -11.00</li><li>Army -12.00</li><li>Florida Atlantic -11.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a> -11.00*</li><li>North Carolina State -10.25</li><li>Georgia Tech -9.50</li><li>Kentucky -9.00</li><li>Nevada -9.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLOST/colorado-state-rams/\">Colorado State</a> -8.75*</li><li>Air Force -8.50</li><li>Florida -8.00</li><li>Minnesota -8.00</li><li>SMU -8.00</li></ul>\n            </div>",

He's $7,800 on DraftKings and $9,000 on FanDuel.</p><p>But after his past two outings, he might not be as popular as normal in DFS. He struggled with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/fantasy/\">Jake Browning</a>, with only 10 catches for 73 yards and no touchdowns on 14 targets combined, but that was on the road at Minnesota and Denver.</p><p>Chase should perform better at home in Week 5 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, who are dealing with injuries in their secondary. I'm expecting a bounce-back game, and Chase could have a squeaky wheel game after he was complaining to Zac Taylor on the sidelines against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>.</p>\n<p>He's too good to continue to struggle, and I'm excited to use Chase in multiple lineups this week.

Mariota, who before this cameo had not started a game since Week 13, 2022, completed 31 of 48 passes (64.6%) for 363 yards, three touchdowns and one interception across the two games.

Pereira has claimed <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-alex-pereira-says-coward-magomed-ankalaev-hid-from-him-at-performance-institute/\" target=\"_blank\">Ankalaev ducked him at the UFC Performance Institute</a></span>, rather than coming face-to-face with his rival. Ankalaev has fired back on social media, and around and around the fighters have gone.</p>\n<p>Speaking to CBS Sports via an interpreter, Ankalaev placed the blame squarely on Pereira and his camp for the bad blood entering Saturday's clash, saying, \"The whole aggression was started by the other side, Alex started it.\"</p><p>What Ankalaev was more interested in addressing was Pereira's recent claims to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/alex-pereira-reveals-he-was-at-just-40-in-title-loss-to-magomed-anakalev-surprised-i-was-able-to-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports' Brian Campbell</a></span> that the Brazilian entered the first fight at just \"40%\" of what he's capable of being due to various issues, resulting in a less dangerous version of his trademark striking.</p>\n<p>\"If he's going to talk about being 40% there or 40% ready, I can say I was only 20%,\" Ankalaev said. \"Everybody knows when the last fight was. It was the holy month of Ramadan, so I wasn't able to prepare the way I needed to prepare either. So, I don't think he should even mention the 40% because everybody knows that I had a much harder camp than he did and a harder time preparing.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-alex-pereira-gets-his-chance-at-redemption-after-rare-humbling-loss-against-magomed-ankalaev/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/708592ee-b8e1-443c-ae13-300a57f2abc9/thumbnail/270x152/54e07dd73f63a36081fb6cd613ed5c3c/pereira-yell-ufc-313.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>During Ramadan, Muslims fast from food and drink from dawn to sunset for a month. Those fasting rules present unique challenges for high-level athletes who follow regimented schedules the rest of the year for exercise and the required food and drink intake to achieve maximum fitness and performance.</p><p>The first fight with Pereira came slightly over a week into Ramadan, which Ankalaev believes impacted his performance, even as he won a unanimous decision by scores of 49-46, 48-47 and 48-47.</p>\n<p>Being able to train and compete without the restrictions of Ramadan this time around, Ankalaev believes he'll be a sharper, better version of himself.</p><p>\"I think I can surprise him with my striking this time around, now that I've had more time to prepare and a full camp,\" Ankalaev said. \"I can also surprise him and give him trouble with my wrestling. This time around, I had a good preparation and a good time getting ready for this fight. You're going to see this is a whole different fight from the first one.\"</p>\n<p>Compared to expectations ahead of their UFC 313 clash, Pereira vs. Ankalaev looked like something out of Bizarro World.</p>\n<p>Ankalaev outstruck the multi-time kickboxing champion, landing 30 more total strikes, while Pereira stuffed all 12 of the superior grappler's takedown attempts. While Ankalaev's takedowns weren't working, his grappling did allow him to smother Pereira in the clinch and dictate the range at which the fight was contested.</p><p>Asked why he was unable to be more successful with his takedowns in the March bout, Ankalaev again pointed to his camp and preparation as the key factor in the fight while saying he will be able to take Pereira down any time he wishes in the rematch.</p><p>\"The only thing that's needed in this fight to take him down is my desire to do so,\" Ankalaev said. \"I just need to want to take him down, and that's what I'll do. In the first fight, I wasn't as well prepared as I wanted to be because of the timing and the camp. Now, you'll see it's all up to me. The only thing I need to do to take him down is just wish for it and do it whenever I feel like it. I will be fully in control of the fight; you will see it.\"</p>\n<p>Ankalaev is riding a 13-fight unbeaten streak, winning 12 and battling Jan Błachowicz to a dull draw in a 2022 bout for the then-vacant light heavyweight championship. It was a long path for Ankalaev, who believed champions didn't want to give him opportunities to fight for the belt as he piled up victories for more than half a decade.</p><p>Knowing how hard it was to get to the mountaintop, Ankalaev said that his approach to being champion is to say yes to whoever the UFC puts in front of him, even if it means granting Pereira an immediate rematch.</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't a plan that we had to immediately rematch him,\" Ankalaev said. \"I didn't think about rematching right away. This is something I told the UFC even before I was champion, 'When I become a champion, I'm not going to pick my opponents, I don't need you to pick opponents for me. I will fight whoever is deserving.'</p>\n<p>\"When I was a contender, when I wasn't champion yet, there were champions who did not want to give me a fight and trying to avoid me. It was like, no matter how many times I tried, the UFC wasn't giving me a chance to fight for the belt. So, I said to myself and the UFC that when I'm champion, whoever is the next in line and most deserving, that's who I want to fight.\"</p><p>Some fighters are making their case to be the next fighter up for the winner of Saturday night's main event.</p><p>This past Saturday, Carlos Ulberg <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-fight-night-results-highlights-carlos-ulberg-blasts-dominick-reyes-for-first-round-ko-wants-title-shot/\" target=\"_blank\">scored a first-round knockout</a></span> of Dominick Reyes in a UFC Fight Night main event. And on the UFC 320 main card, former light heavyweight champ Jiri Prochazka will battle former title challenger Khalil Rountree.</p>\n<p>Ulberg is ranked No. 3 in the UFC's official light heavyweight rankings while Prochazka is No. 2, and Rountree sits at No. 4. It seems clear that the winner of Ankalaev vs. Pereira will have some clear deserving challenges come Sunday morning. Ankalaev seems more interested in Ulberg as someone who had not lost to Pereira during the Brazilian's reign as champion, as is the case with Prochazka and Rountree.</p><p>\"Obviously, I'm looking at the division and the new guys,\" Ankalaev said. \"There are some guys who already have losses to the former champion, so I'm very interested in seeing the new guys and whoever is next and deserving. The UFC, whoever they want to give me, it seems as though some guys are going well and haven't lost in a while, I think Ulberg hasn't lost in a good amount of time, but we'll see.</p><p>\"In the past, if the UFC needed them to stall or get a loss, usually they would put a contender against me. Whenever somebody needed to be stopped, they would give them a fight against me, and all of a sudden, those guys get stopped.\"</p>\n<p>Before looking ahead to the next challenger, however, Ankalaev knows Saturday will be a dangerous fight against an opponent who will be looking to go for broke in an attempt to regain the belt.</p><p>\"I think it's going to be a firefight because he's going to be going for broke; he's got nothing to lose,\" Ankalaev said. \"He's going to try and do whatever he can to win and I'm going to do whatever I can to stop him early. I think it's going to be an exciting fight, a ruthless fight, and it's going to be very, very different from the fight we saw before. It's going to be something everyone is going to want to tune in for.\"</p><p><strong>Who wins UFC 320: Ankalaev vs. Pereira, and how exactly does the fight end? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-320-odds-picks-mma-analyst-releases-picks-for-ankalaev-vs-pereira-2-and-other-fights-for-october-4-showcase/#ttag=100425_agg_cbssports_picks_UFC_DanielVithlani_UFC320AnkalaevPereira2\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert</a> who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

In all, five of the most popular teams in the Circa Survivor picked up victories. Only the Buffalo Bills threw a scare into players before finally disposing of the pesky New Orleans Saints.

Even with rumors (that Pereira refuses to confirm) that \"Poatan\" was suffering from a broken hand and a battle with norovirus, he still incredibly stuffed all 12 takedown attempts from the wrestling dominant Ankalaev. The new champion unquestionably deserved the close decision win by pressuring Pereira and relying upon his technical advantage to outstrike him. But even though Ankalaev is the more well-rounded fighter of the two, his passivity in big moments against elite foes precedes their first meeting and he isn't anywhere as dangerous or clutch as the stalking Pereira. With a full gas tank, healed body and far less distractions this camp after winning fighter of the year in 2024 and becoming the UFC's biggest star, expect the 38-year-old Pereira to redeem himself in a big way after a slow and competitive start. </p><p><strong>Brookhouse: </strong>For all the talk of Ankalaev's wrestling, he is a fighter who has never utilized great takedowns. He averages 0.8 takedowns per 15 minutes of Octagon time with 22% takedown accuracy. Where Ankalaev's grappling was a factor in the first fight with Pereira was in how it allowed him to control the clinch and nullify Pereira's game. Pereira will make adjustments, I'm sure, and will likely go for broke knowing he can't sit back and pick his spots. That could lead to a win for Pereira, or it will leave him open for counterfire. It just feels like Ankalaev knows he can clinch and bully Pereira around the cage, even if he can't score takedowns, and that should be enough for another win for Ankalaev.</p><p><strong>Mahjouri: </strong>The analysis around Ankalaev vs. Pereira is peculiar. Before their first fight, Ankalaev's wrestling was presented as his greatest asset. In truth, his wrestling credentials were overblown, but it didn't stop him from winning the title. Ankalaev nullified Pereira with a combination of point striking and clinch work. Pereira seems to struggle when he can't dictate the terms of engagement. Ankalaev's best strength is his well-roundedness. It should empower him to win another decision against \"Poatan.\"</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\">Pick UFC 320 at Underdog Fantasy</a>, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.</em></p><h2>Merab vs. Sandhagen</h2><p><strong>Campbell: </strong>It's true, Sandhagen represents the most difficult style challenge to Dvalishvili during his incredible run of 13 straight wins that led him to both the bantamweight title and a top five spot on <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-pound-for-pound-fighter-rankings-khamzat-chimaev-jumps-into-top-five-despite-boos-in-victory/\" target=\"_blank\">the pound-for-pound rankings</a></span>. Sandhagen even has a strong gas tank, to boot, and an unpredictable array of leaping strikes that could prove to be the Kryptonite to Dvalishvili's spamming takedown attack. So why has Dvalishvili been installed as a 4-to-1 betting favorite despite all of that? Because the relentless Georgian simply refuses to be outworked and has subtly improved his striking enough along the way to be a factor against anyone. Dvalishvili also has an overwhelming amount of momentum on his side against an opponent in Sandhagen who is talented and has long been seen as a title threat, yet can't seem to win the big one when the opportunity is presented to him.</p><p><strong>Mahjouri: </strong>Dvalishvili told CBS Sports that he'd strike with Sandhagen in pursuit of a knockout. Sandhagen is confident that his wrestling skills hold up against the champion. I don't believe either of them. Dvalisvili's endurance and wrestling are a lethal combination. While Sandhagen's endurance is better than most bantamweights, it's hard to believe he's completely reinvented that part of his game. The champ's consistent pressure will break Sandhagen's rhythm, preventing him from building a lead with his dynamic striking. </p>\n<h2>Prochazka vs. Rountree Jr. </h2><p><strong>Brookhouse: </strong>Who really knows with this one, right? Prochazka wins fights where he's getting cracked routinely because he just never stops winging knockout shots. That didn't work against Pereira (twice) because Pereira is a machine built to eliminate fighters who are not defensively responsible. Rountree has the power to make Prochazka pay for fighting the way he does, but when does that ever really matter in a Prochazka fight?</p><p><strong>Mahjouri: </strong>Prochazka's fights are impossible to predict. Offensively, he might be the most dangerous fighter in any division, but his defensive lapses and striking obsession make him vulnerable. Rountree can crack, and his superior technical skills could end his opponent's night early. However, Prochazka has a knack for overcoming obstacles not named Pereira. With bated breath, I think Prochazka fights a fight-ending shot that puts Rountree down. </p><p><strong>Who wins UFC 320: Ankalaev vs. Pereira, and how exactly does the fight end? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-320-odds-picks-mma-analyst-releases-picks-for-ankalaev-vs-pereira-2-and-other-fights-for-october-4-showcase/#ttag=100425_agg_cbssports_picks_UFC_DanielVithlani_UFC320AnkalaevPereira2\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert</a> who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Injuries are starting to pile up in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> as we are now in Week 5, and we've seen quite a few notable quarterbacks sidelined in particular. If you're interested in <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a></span>, you need to be aware of who's in and who's out before you place any wagers.</p><p>Here, we break down the biggest NFL injuries to know for all of the Week 5 games on Sunday and Monday, including where lines currently stand, according to the latest <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine consensus odds</a>, which uses the latest data and odds from <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">top sportsbooks</a></span>. This post will be updated as official inactives lists are announced before kickoff. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a> (9:30 a.m. ET, in London)</h3><ul><li>MINN QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/jj-mccarthy/\">JJ McCarthy</a> (ankle, out)</li><li>MINN C <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893142/ryan-kelly/\">Ryan Kelly</a> (concussion, out)</li><li>MINN OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136495/brian-oneill/\">Brian O'Neill</a> (knee, out)</li><li>MINN OG <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26702924/donovan-jackson/\">Donovan Jackson</a> (wrist, out)</li><li>CLE CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966771/greg-newsome-ii/\">Greg Newsome II</a> (hamstring, questionable)</li></ul>\n<p>The Vikings remain overseas for their second European game in a row, this time against the Browns. Minnesota is reeling on offense, with starting quarterback JJ McCarthy out for the third week in a row with an ankle injury, meaning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a> will start once again. Additionally, the Vikings will be down three starting offensive linemen against a very good Browns defensive front headlined by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139869/myles-garrett/\">Myles Garrett</a>. The biggest Browns injury to follow is starting cornerback Greg Newsome II, as the Vikings have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a> and got <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a> back last week.</p><p>The Vikings are 3.5-point favorites, according to SportsLine consensus odds, and the total is just 35.5, by far the lowest over/under of the entire Week 5 slate. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>BAL QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>BAL CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139775/marlon-humphrey/\">Marlon Humphrey</a> (calf, out)</li><li>BAL CB Chidobe Aquzie (hamstring, out)</li><li>BAL LB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180472/roquan-smith/\">Roquan Smith</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>BAL FB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818911/patrick-ricard/\">Patrick Ricard</a> (calf, out)</li><li>BAL S <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3136877/kyle-hamilton/\">Kyle Hamilton</a> (groin, questionable) </li><li>BAL OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2005667/ronnie-stanley/\">Ronnie Stanley</a> (ankle, questionable) <br /></li></ul>\n<p>The Ravens are beat up. Baltimore will be looking to get to 2-3 on the year when they host the Texans, but the Ravens will be without Lamar Jackson, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000176/cooper-rush/\">Cooper Rush</a> slated to start. Additionally, both of the team's starting cornerbacks are out, top linebacker Roquan Smith is out and star safety Kyle Hamilton and left tackle Ronnie Stanley are both questionable. The Texans, meanwhile, are relatively healthy, especially in comparison to Baltimore.</p><p>With so many players out on the Ravens side, Houston is now a 1.5-point favorite on the road.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>CAR RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865693/chuba-hubbard/\">Chuba Hubbard</a> (calf, out)</li><li>MIA WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/\">Tyreek Hill</a> (knee, out for season)</li></ul>\n<p>The Dolphins will be without one of the top play makers in the NFL after star receiver Tyreek Hill dislocated his knee on Monday. Hill is out not just this week, but for the rest of 2025 with an eye towards returning in early 2026. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2962110/jaylen-waddle/\">Jaylen Waddle</a> will now step into the WR1 role for Miami.</p><p>Carolina is without top running back Chuba Hubbard this week against the Dolphins, opening the door for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252798/rico-dowdle/\">Rico Dowdle</a> to get the bulk of the carries for the Panthers. </p><p>Miami is favored by 1.5 points in Carolina, and the total is set at 44.5.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>LV TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693971/brock-bowers/\">Brock Bowers</a> (knee, questionable)</li><li>LV TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171673/michael-mayer/\">Michael Mayer</a> (concussion, questionable)</li><li>LV CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871751/eric-stokes/\">Eric Stokes</a> (knee, questionable)</li><li>IND CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818965/kenny-moore/\">Kenny Moore</a> (Achilles, out)</li></ul>\n<p>The Raiders may be down star tight end Brock Bowers this week as the second-year pro is questionable with a knee injury. After being a limited participant on Wednesday, Bowers didn't practice on Friday. Making matters more complicated is that his backup, Michael Mayer, is also questionable due to a concussion, but he was limited Wednesday through Friday. Vegas also listed starting cornerback Eric Stokes as questionable.</p><p>The Colts are without a few players Sunday, none more notable than star nickel corner Kenny Moore.  </p><p>Indianapolis is a 7-point favorite on Sunday and the total is set at 48.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>NO TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186637/juwan-johnson/\">Juwan Johnson</a> (ankle, questionable)</li><li>NO TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818935/taysom-hill/\">Taysom Hill</a> (knee, questionable)</li><li>NO TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180634/foster-moreau/\">Foster Moreau</a> (knee, questionable)</li><li>NYG RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963637/tyrone-tracy-jr/\">Tyrone Tracy Jr</a>.

Dallas is without star receiver CeeDee Lamb for the second week in a row, and the team is also down two starting offensive linemen in Tyler Guyton and Tyler Booker. Dallas' receiver room is also down KaVontae Turpin, so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/\">George Pickens</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2868238/jalen-tolbert/\">Jalen Tolbert</a> will get the bulk of the looks for the Cowboys in the passing game alongside tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867159/jake-ferguson/\">Jake Ferguson</a>.</p><p>The total here is 47.5, and Dallas is a 1.5-point favorite. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>No notable injuries</li></ul>\n<p>The Broncos and Eagles both enter this game in great spots in the health department in what could be one of the games of the week. The Broncos are 2-2 and haven't looked like the playoff team we saw a year ago, but the talent is obviously there. The Eagles are one of two 4-0 teams left as they defend their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> title, but they've been playing with fire in the early stages of 2025.</p><p>Philly is a 4.5-point favorite entering the weekend. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> (4:05 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>TENN WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186328/calvin-ridley/\">Calvin Ridley</a> (elbow, questionable)</li><li>TENN RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122588/tyjae-spears/\">Tyjae Spears</a> (ankle, questionable)</li><li>TENN OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694508/jc-latham/\">JC Latham</a> (hip, out)</li><li>AZ RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a> (ankle, injured reserve)</li><li>AZ CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1906884/will-johnson/\">Will Johnson</a> (groin, questionable)</li></ul>\n<p>The Titans' offense has been awful to begin the year, and it may be without top receiver Calvin Ridley against the Cardinals as the veteran is questionable. Starting right tackle JC Latham is out once again, as well. The good news is running back Tyjae Spears is questionable to make his season debut, so he could potentially give a stagnant Tennessee offense a boost.</p><p>As for the Cardinals, their running back contingency plan is being tested. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a> is out for the year, which opened the door for second-year back Trey Benson. Unfortunately for the Cards, Benson injured his ankle last week, so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804075/michael-carter/\">Michael Carter</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> are expected to get the bulk of the touches out of the backfield moving forward.</p><p>Arizona is a 7.5-point favorite over the visiting Titans, while the total is 41.5.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> (4:05 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>TB RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/\">Bucky Irving</a> (foot, out)</li><li>TB WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>TB CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179803/jamel-dean/\">Jamel Dean</a> (hip, out)</li><li>TB CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28924605/benjamin-morrison/\">Benjamin Morrison</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>SEA CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3137159/devon-witherspoon/\">Devon Witherspoon</a> (knee, out)</li><li>SEA S <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260683/julian-love/\">Julian Love</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>SEA DL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1984683/demarcus-lawrence/\">DeMarcus Lawrence</a> (quad, out)</li></ul>\n<p>Two 3-1 squads will be without key players in the Pacific Northwest on Sunday. The Bucs will again be without star receiver Mike Evans, but they'll also be without standout running back Bucky Irving, paving the way for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3169147/rachaad-white/\">Rachaad White</a> to assume lead back duties for Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers will also be without two of their top cornerbacks.</p><p>Seattle is also hurting in the secondary, with top cornerback Devon Witherspoon and starting safety Julian Love both out against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> and Co. Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence will also be out on Sunday.</p><p>The Seahawks are 3.5-point favorites at home, and the total is 44.5 </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> (4:25 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>DET OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1983776/taylor-decker/\">Taylor Decker</a> (shoulder, questionable)</li><li>DET S <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961816/kerby-joseph/\">Kerby Joseph</a> (knee, questionable)</li><li>CIN DL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923420/shemar-stewart/\">Shemar Stewart</a> (ankle, out)</li></ul>\n<p>Two key Detroit starters are questionable here, but Taylor Decker and Kerby Joseph have both been suiting up of late despite questionable designations. As for the Bengals, first-round edge rusher Shemar Stewart is out for the third week in a row.</p><p>With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> sidelined for the foreseeable future, expect the Bengals to be underdogs in most of their games. That's especially true here, with Detroit favored by 10.5 on the road.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> (4:25 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>WAS WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139279/terry-mclaurin/\">Terry McLaurin</a> (quad, out)</li><li>WAS WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139270/noah-brown/\">Noah Brown</a> (groin and knee, out)</li><li>LAC OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26713136/joe-alt/\">Joe Alt</a> (ankle, out)</li><li>LAC OG <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867297/mekhi-becton/\">Mekhi Becton</a> (concussion)</li></ul>\n<p>The good news for the Commanders -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> is back after missing the last two weeks with a knee injury. The bad news is he's down a few weapons in the passing game. Top Washington receiver Terry McLaurin is out for the second straight week, and Noah Brown is also down. Daniels will at least have Deebo Samuel. He's off the injury report as he's been dealing with a heel injury.</p><p>Los Angeles' offensive line woes continue this week. Already without left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2835704/rashawn-slater/\">Rashawn Slater</a> for the year, second-year standout tackle Joe Alt is out this week, and starting guard Mekhi Becton is questionable.</p><p>The Chargers are favored by 2.5 and the total is 47.5.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> (8:20 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>NE DT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2816306/milton-williams/\">Milton Williams</a> (ankle, questionable)</li><li>NE CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183962/carlton-davis/\">Carlton Davis</a> (illness, questionable)</li><li>NE LB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804551/klavon-chaisson/\">K'Lavon Chaisson</a> (knee, questionable)</li><li>BUFF LB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122709/dorian-williams/\">Dorian Williams</a> (knee, out)</li><li>BUFF LB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2078974/matt-milano/\">Matt Milano</a> (pectoral, questionable)</li><li>BUFF <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2247345/ed-oliver/\">Ed Oliver</a> (ankle, questionable)</li><li>BUFF OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2247155/spencer-brown/\">Spencer Brown</a> (calf, questionable)</li></ul>\n<p>Neither side is in danger of being without any of their biggest stars, but a number of key starters are out or questionable for both the Patriots and Bills ahead of Sunday Night Football.</p><p>Buffalo will for sure be without starting linebacker Dorian Williams, and fellow starting linebacker Matt Milano is questionable. Starting defensive tackle Ed Oliver and offensive tackle Spencer Brown are both questionable for the Bills, too.</p><p>The Patriots have three starters questionable here, including coveted free-agent addition Milton Williams, who anchors the front of New England's defense.</p><p>The Bills are 8.5-point favorites at home, and the total is 49.5. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)</h3><ul><li>JAX DL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123606/travon-walker/\">Travon Walker</a> (wrist, TBD)</li></ul>\n<p>As this is the Monday night game, we won't get official injury designations until Saturday. Looking at the practice reports for each team, though, and it appears both sides are in good shape, with former No. 1 pick Travon Walker one of just two players for both teams who didn't practice on Friday.</p><p>The Chiefs are 3.5-point favorites on the road as they look to get over .500 for the first time this season.</p>\n            </div>",

There are two big 10:30 p.m. ET matchups with BYU hosting West Virginia in the Big 12 and San Diego State hosting Colorado State for a Mountain West battle that will be broadcast on CBS Sports Network.</p><p>Picks from both of those games are among our Friday college football best bets on BetMGM Sportsbook today from the SportsLine Projection Model and our team of experts.

The model is on a sizzling 39-20 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024 and is a profitable 37-24 combined on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its college football betting picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.  </p><h2>Best Friday college football predictions at BetMGM</h2><ul><li>Charlotte +28 vs. South Florida (-110)</li><li>BYU -20.5 vs. West Virginia (-105)</li><li>Colorado State +6.5 vs. San Diego State (-118)</li></ul><p>Combining these three picks into a Friday multi-sport parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +611 (risk $100 to win $611). <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at BetMGM here</a>:</p><h2>Charlotte +28 vs. South Florida (-110)</h2><p>The Bulls were briefly ranked after an upset win over Florida but got shelled 49-12 the following week by Miami. They were able to rebound for a 63-14 win over FCS opponent South Carolina State and then enjoyed a bye week, but Charlotte also had an extra week of prep. The 49ers have struggled a bit in Tim Albin's first season, but this is a big number and the model has <strong>Charlotte covering in 62% of simulations.</strong></p><p>BYU -20.5 vs. West Virginia (-110)</p><p>\"West Virginia gets a late-night kickoff a long way from home. QB Nicco Marchiol is out, rehabbing from injury, and might be joined by other starters. Not a promising scenario for the Mountaineers, who've been outscored by 65 points in a pair of Big 12 games and did not penetrate the goal line during the first half in either,\" SportsLine college football expert Mike Tierney (9-3 on his last 12 CFB picks) said. \"They cannot count on turnovers from BYU QB Bear Bachmeier, who has yet to unfurl an interception. (He also has 10 TDs throws.) This shapes up as midnight sadness for WVU, based on the 10:30 p.m. (ET) start.\"</p><p>Colorado State +6.5 vs. San Diego State (-118)</p><p>Jay Norvell's program looked like it was turning a corner with an eight-win season in 2024, but Colorado State is off to a frustrating 1-3 start in 2025. However, the schedule has been pretty tough thus far and the Rams actually played Washington State a little tougher than San Diego State did, losing 20-3 while SDSU lost 36-13. October has been when Colorado State has heated up the last couple years (6-1 against the spread), and the model has the <strong>Rams covering in 64% of simulations.</strong></p><h2>Want more college football picks for Friday, October 3?</h2><p><strong>You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

The move comes days after the team and former manager Bruce Bochy, who in 2023 led Texas to its first World Series title in franchise history, mutually agreed to part ways.</p><blockquote><p>\"We are thrilled to announce this promotion and have Skip leading this club in the dugout,\" said Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young in a statement released by the team. \"Over his past year as a senior advisor to our baseball operations group, Skip has proven to be driven, passionate and thorough in everything he does. He has a winning spirit and energy, and we are fortunate that someone so highly regarded in the industry has agreed to become our manager.</p><p>\"We have enjoyed getting to know Skip and his family since he joined the organization last year, and we look forward to welcoming his wife Lindsey and the entire Schumaker family to the Metroplex.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schumaker, 45, becomes the 21st manager in franchise history. He previously managed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Miami Marlins</a> for two seasons, including a 2023 campaign in which he guided them to 84 wins and a postseason berth. That earned him National League Manager of the Year honors. After that season, the Marlins under a new front office pivoted to a rebuild, and Schumaker stepped down after a 100-loss season in 2024. Schumaker spent this past season as a senior advisor within the Rangers' baseball operations department. Upon joining the organization, he was widely regarded as the heir apparent to Bochy. </p><p>\"I am honored and excited for this opportunity to manage the Rangers,\" said Schumaker in that same statement. \"While I attained a good understanding of the organization through my front office role this past season, the conversations with Chris Young, Ross Fenstermaker, and others this week have only intensified my interest in this opportunity. I can't wait to begin the work for 2026.\"</p><p>Schumaker inherits a Rangers club with a compelling mix of young and veteran talent. However, the roster disappointed in 2025 with an 81-81 finish and third-place status in the American League West. </p>\n<p>Prior to his coaching, managerial, and front-office career, Schumaker spent parts of 11 seasons as an infielder and outfielder in the majors, mostly with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Seven months ago, Magomed Ankalaev beat Pereira for the UFC light heavyweight championship. \"Poatan\" has a chance to redeem himself in a title rematch at UFC 320 on Saturday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p><p>Pereira became a key player for the UFC through activity, defending his title four times in 13 months. A string of vicious knockouts made him a fan-favorite, but Ankalaev nullified that threat <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-313-results-highlights-magomed-ankalaev-upsets-alex-pereira-to-claim-light-heavyweight-title/live/\" target=\"_blank\">at UFC 313</a>. Ankalaev, widely believed to be the better wrestler, outstruck Pereira in a largely forgettable fight. Pereira tries to redeem his surprisingly tepid last showing, while Ankalaev tries to cement himself as unequivocally the better man.</p><p>UFC 320's co-main event is a fight fans have wanted for a long time. UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili is on a dominant run after beating Sean O'Malley (twice) and Umar Nurmagomedov. Dvalishvili can extend his record for the longest bantamweight win streak by fending off his next challenger. Cory Sandhagen has long been tabbed as a future champion. After repeatedly falling just short of a breakout, \"The Sandman\" finally gets his shot at undisputed gold.</p>\n<p>The undercard is littered with intriguing names looking to get back to title contention. A former champion and former title challenger meet in a featured bout when Jiri Prochazka takes on Khalil Rountree Jr. at light heavyweight. UFC veteran Josh Emmett looks to work his way back into the title picture at 145 pounds when he takes on the fast rising prospect Youssef Zalal. And American middleweight Joe Pyfer has a chance to silence some critics when he takes on Abus Magomedov to open the PPV on Saturday.</p><p>Below is the complete fight card for UFC 320, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>On Sunday night, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000038/stefon-diggs/\">Stefon Diggs</a> will return to Buffalo for the first time since the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> traded him to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> in April 2024. Now a member of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a>, Diggs knows it probably won't be just another game.</p><p>Diggs spent four seasons with the Bills from 2020-23, and he was brilliant. He totaled 445 receptions for 5,372 yards and 37 touchdowns. <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2025/10/01/stefon-diggs-patriots-bills-comments-buffalo-return/\" target=\"_blank\">In an interview with Boston.com</a>, Diggs acknowledged that his return will be \"sentimental\" and \"emotional.\"</p><p>Formerly on the same side as the Buffalo faithful, Diggs knows what he will be walking into on Sunday night.</p><p>\"I try to keep the main thing the main thing, but it's my first time back there,\" Diggs said. \"It's going to be a hell of an atmosphere. I was a part of that for a long time. I played there before I got there. So, I'm excited.\"</p>\n<p>Toward the end of his time with the Bills, it looked from the outside as though tensions between Diggs and the team were on the rise. After Joe Brady was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2023, Diggs' production dipped a bit, and the Bills dealt him to the Texans just months later.</p><p>Diggs said that's just life in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. He tries not to concern himself with those decisions too much because they are largely out of his control.</p><p>\"It's just the nature of the business, I'm not in control of nothing,\" Diggs told Boston.com. \"I get open and catch the ball. But, like, the internal stuff, obviously I miss those guys over there. You spend a lot of time with people and it becomes more personal than just professional, so when I say it's the nature of the business, that's just how it goes.\"</p>\n<p>As far as his former teammates are concerned, Diggs noted that they will \"tab jabs at each other\" while admitting he will greet them with \"a big hug.\"</p><p>Between what will be an emotional return for Diggs and a key divisional matchup, Diggs said the biggest challenge will be keeping a level head on a big stage. Are the Patriots ready to step up in the national spotlight?</p><p>\"I feel like we don't have a choice,\" said Diggs.</p><p>When it comes to the scoreboard and the standings, Diggs and the Patriots have a huge opportunity to make a statement in primetime against undefeated Bills. Kickoff is set for 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday night.</p>\n            </div>",

They can secure passage to the round of 16 with a victory, and even with Barcelona needing to recall keeper Diego Kochen to serve as their number two keeper because of an injury crisis, there is plenty of talent available to the USMNT. </p><p>Cremaschi scored a hat trick and netted two assists in the opening match, and the Parma man will be a key figure in the team. He has three camps for the senior team, and he'll be looking for more. The best performance at this tournament was in the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, where they finished in fourth place, but in 2023 in Argentina, they were able to secure a fifth-place finish. That 2023 squad included players like Diego Luna and Jack McGlynn, showing the importance of this tournament to preparing players for the Olympics and the senior national team.</p><h2>How to watch US U-20s vs. France U-20s</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Thursday, Oct. 2 | <strong>Time</strong>: 4 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Estadio El Teniente -- O'Higgins, Chile</li><li><strong>TV: </strong>FS2 | <strong>Live stream: </strong>Fubo (<a href=\"http://www.fubo.tv/lp/soccer/?irad=356358&irmp=416484&sharedID=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Try for free</a>)</li></ul><h2>FIFA U-20 WORLD CUP ROSTER</h2><p><strong>GOALKEEPERS (3)</strong>: 12-Adam Beaudry (Colorado Rapids; Castle Pines, Colo.; 7/0), 21-Duran Ferree (San Diego FC; San Diego, Calif.; 1/0)</p>\n<p><strong>DEFENDERS (7): </strong>2-Reed Baker-Whiting (Seattle Sounders; Seattle, Wash.; 7/0), 18-Luca Bombino (San Diego FC; Saugus, Calif.; 9/0), 5-Noah Cobb (Colorado Rapids; Chattanooga, Tenn.; 13/0), 16-Ethan Kohler (SC Verl/GER; Campbell, Calif.; 12/1), 3-Nolan Norris (FC Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas; 16/0), 17-Francis Westfield (Philadelphia Union; Philadelphia, Pa.; 7/0), 4-Joshua Wynder (Benfica/POR; Louisville, Ky.; 11/1) </p><p><strong>MIDFIELDERS (6):</strong> 19-Matthew Corcoran (Nashville SC; Dallas, Texas; 5/1), 8-Benjamin Cremaschi (Parma/ITA; Key Biscayne, Fla.; 9/2), 14-Taha Habroune (Columbus Crew; Columbus, Ohio; 14/2), 6-Brooklyn Raines (Houston Dynamo; Chicago, Ill.; 15/1), 15-Pedro Soma (San Diego FC; Coconut Creek, Fla.; 15/2), 10-Niko Tsakiris (San Jose Earthquakes; Saratoga, Calif.; 23/8)</p>\n<p><strong>FORWARDS (5):</strong> 11-Luke Brennan (Atlanta United; Atlanta, Ga.; 10/2), 7-Cole Campbell (Borussia Dortmund/GER; Peachtree City, Ga.; 3/0), 20-Zavier Gozo (Real Salt Lake City; Eagle Mountain, Utah; 11/2), 13-Peyton Miller (New England Revolution; Unionville, Conn.; 6/1), 9-Marcos Zambrano (Real Salt Lake; Gladwyne, Pa.; 13/6)</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> have spent several years looking for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-bradys/\">Tom Brady's</a> replacement, and based on how things are going so far, it appears they might have finally found their guy in Drake Maye. </p><p>Through four weeks, Maye has been one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> top quarterbacks: </p><ul><li>He has the fifth-highest passer rating in the league (109.4).</li><li>He has the sixth-most passing yards (988).</li><li>He ranks in the top 10 in touchdown passes (seven).</li></ul><p>Maye also has 98 rushing yards on the season, which ranks in the top 10 for quarterbacks. </p><p>As impressive as those stats are, there's one part of his game where he actually ranks at the top of the NFL, and it's his accuracy. Maye has completed 74% of his passes this year, which is No. 1 in the league. </p><p>During the Patriots' 42-13 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> in Week 4, Maye completed 14 of 17 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns. This marked the third straight game where he completed at least 75% of his passes with at least two touchdowns, and now, he's on the verge of history. Only Tom Brady <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLPlus/status/1972391436151820565\" target=\"_blank\">has hit those numbers in four straight games</a> during a single season, so if Maye can do it one more time, he'll tie Brady in the NFL record book. </p>\n<p>Brady accomplished the feat during a four-game stretch in 2007, which is the season where the Patriots went undefeated. Brady also was voted the NFL MVP that year. So yes, you could say that Maye is playing at an MVP level through four weeks. Maye and the Patriots will face a formidable opponent this week in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, so if he ends up tying Brady's record, he'll definitely have earned it. </p><p>In just his second season, Maye is already playing like a top 10 quarterback. The 23-year-old has come up especially big in the clutch, as he's been arguably the best quarterback in the NFL this year on third or fourth down. </p>\n<p>The most impressive part is that Maye has put up these numbers while running a new offense. Maye worked with offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt as a rookie, but Josh McDaniels replaced him before this year. McDaniels was Brady's OC for more than 10 years in New England, so maybe we shouldn't be shocked that he has Maye playing like the six-time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>-winning quarterback who now has a statue at Gillette Stadium. </p>\n<p>After the win over the Panthers on Sunday, Maye was asked if he's feeling more comfortable in McDaniels' offense compared to Week 1, and he gave a Brady-like answer: He didn't want to talk about comfort; he wanted to point out that you have to learn things from both wins and losses. </p><p>\"I think there's still stuff on the tape that Coach (Mike Vrabel) will get on me about, and I think that's the best thing to do is, with a loss, you kind of learn from it and take it to heart. Also, when you win, look at the tape and learn from it,\" Maye said. \"There's things that are going to show up in this game that matter down the road. Yeah, getting more and more comfortable. I think those guys around me are helping me out.\"</p><p>It feels like Maye has finally arrived, and he'll have a chance to prove that to a national audience Sunday night when the Patriots travel to Buffalo to face <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a> and the Bills. If Maye can lead his team to an upset, that would make New England a dark horse to steal the AFC East, a division Buffalo has won five straight years. </p>\n            </div>",

Scheyer, who replaced legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski, previously signed an extension in 2023 that ran through 2029. </p><p>Scheyer is less than a year removed from leading the Blue Devils to the 2025 Final Four, the program's first in three years. He also has 89 wins through his first three seasons in charge, tying former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/BUTLER/butler-bulldogs/\">Butler</a> coach Brad Stevens and current <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> coach Brad Underwood for the most in Division I history in that span. </p><p>Scheyer's Blue Devils finished the 2024-25 season with a 35-4 record, marking the first time that Scheyer has won 30 games in a single season. It was also the program's best record in a decade. That included a 19-1 record in conference play as Duke won both the ACC Tournament and the ACC regular season crown. Prior to taking over in the wake of Krzyzewski's retirement, Scheyer was an assistant at Duke from 2014-18 and an associate head coach for the Blue Devils from 2018-22. </p><p>Scheyer also played under Krzyzewski at Duke from 2006-10. He was a 2010 first-team All-ACC selection as he helped guide the Blue Devils to their fourth national title with Krzyzewski at the helm. </p>\n<h2>Scheyer recruiting at a high level </h2><p>Though Scheyer is improving as an in-game coach, his recruiting has always been on point. In fact, through his three short years, he's amassed some of the most impressive recruiting classes in Duke's proud history. </p><p>In 2022, just months after he was hand-picked as Krzyzewski's successor, Duke signed the No. 1 recruiting class. The Blue Devils have signed the top college basketball recruiting class in all but one year of Scheyer's tenure. </p>\n<p>Thirteen of the 22 prospects that have signed with Duke since 2022 graded out as five stars, per 247Sports. Scheyer has also signed four of the 12 highest-rated players in program history over the last three years. That includes Cooper Flagg, who was the top overall prospect in the Class of 2024 and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Flagg was one of three Blue Devils taken in the first round of June's draft. Kon Knueppel went fourth overall and Khaman Maluach went off the board at No. 10. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

On Wednesday, White revealed that the company will spend well into the six figures to repair the grass that will be damaged on the South Lawn, where the Octagon will be stationed.</p><p>\"This is just  one little piece I was talking about  last night: To replace the grass,  because we're going to f--- up the  South Lawn, $700,000 just to  replace the grass,\" White told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/10/01/ufc-to-spend-700000-replacing-white-house-lawn-after-2026-fight-card/\">Sports Business Journal</a>.   </p><p>Such unique challenges underscore White's apprehension towards non-arena shows. He's historically avoided booking stadiums or outdoor venues with rare exceptions, such as UFC 306 at The Sphere and Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford at Allegiant Stadium, both in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>\"There is no doubt about it, this is going to be the most challenging event we have ever done,\" White said. \"I'm coming off a stadium event, which I don't like stadiums, to the  thing that I hate the most in outdoor events.\"</p><p>That being said, White <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/dana-white-says-canelo-alvarez-vs-terence-crawford-could-open-door-for-ufc-stadium-shows/\" target=\"_blank\">told CBS Sports</a></span> in advance of Canelo vs. Crawford that the show's success could entice him to book the UFC's first-ever stadium show stateside. </p>\n<p>The UFC's White House show has changed greatly since President Trump <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-confirms-president-donald-trumps-plans-for-white-house-fight-card-conor-mcgregor-says-count-me-in/\" target=\"_blank\">first proposed it</a></span>. Originally suggested for America's 250th birthday, the card is now expected to take place in June instead of the July 4th weekend. Trump also suggested 20,000 to 25,000 spectators would attend; however, White says the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-ceo-dana-white-capacity-will-be-limited-for-event-at-white-house-but-has-plans-for-fans-to-attend-nearby/\" target=\"_blank\">number will be closer to 5,000</a></span> -- with a nearby park accommodating upwards of 85,000.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

The Lobos are riding a three-game win streak, most recently taking down rival New Mexico State 38-20. Quarterback Jack Layne, a transfer from Idaho, has brought consistency to an offense that has found balance early in the season. San Jose State, meanwhile, is looking to rebound from a heartbreaking 30-29 loss to Stanford, with wide receiver Danny Scudero emerging as a key playmaker for the Spartans' offensive attack.

Now that several pitching coaches have successfully made the jump from college to the big leagues, Bowden said teams are more open to plucking managers from that level as well.</p><p>More specifically, a trio of highly successful college managers keep coming up in discussions Bowden has had with MLB executives. Link Jarrett, Tim Corbin and Tony Vitello will all get some interest from teams looking to hire a new manager this offseason.</p><p>\"In all my conversations with GMs and executives around the league, there are three names that come up all the time in terms of college coaches they believe can manage in the big leagues right now,\" Bowden said. \"There's Link Jarrett from Florida State, Tim Corbin from Vanderbilt and Tony Vitello from Tennessee. Those are the three names I keep hearing over and over again. I won't be surprised if one of the three gets one of the eight openings this offseason. That's something to watch.\"</p>\n<p>Jarrett, 53, has been a manager since he took over at UNC Greensboro in 2013. He spent three years at Notre Dame from 2020-22, and he's been with the Seminoles ever since. Jarrett's overall record is 415-262 with two College World Series appearances and two more NCAA Super Regional appearances.</p><p>Vitello, 46, has taken the Tennessee baseball program to new heights since arriving in 2018. He is 341-131 with the Vols, and he led them to a national championship in 2024. He has two more College World Series appearances and four total SEC titles (regular season and tournament).</p><p>The longest résumé of that trio belongs to Corbin, a 64-year-old entering his 24th season at Vanderbilt. Corbin has more than 1,000 career wins at the college level, two national championships, five College World Series appearances, four SEC tournament championships and four SEC regular season titles.</p>\n<p>The team most likely to give one of those managers an MLB opportunity is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">San Francisco Giants</a>. According to Bowden, Giants president of baseball operations <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1660162/buster-posey/\">Buster Posey</a> is keeping an open mind when it comes to potential replacements for Bob Melvin.</p><p>\"In particular, watch the San Francisco Giants here because I keep hearing Buster Posey is very open to thinking out of the box and hiring one of these college coaches,\" Posey said.</p><p>Posey provided support for this when asked about the idea of bringing Bruce Bochy, who was fired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a>, back to San Francisco. Posey <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/why-giants-executive-buster-posey-ruled-out-a-bruce-bochy-reunion-amid-search-for-new-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">effectively shot down the suggestion</a></span>, saying the Giants would be going a different direction.</p>\n            </div>",

The Rams and 49ers both enter the game at 3-1 and tied for the lead in the division with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>. However at DraftKings, Los Angeles is a slight +110 favorite to win the NFC West, slightly ahead of San Francisco (+190) and Seattle (+370). </p><p>The 49ers will face the Rams severely shorthanded offensively. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a>, who missed Weeks 2 and 3 with a toe injury, has been ruled out because of that same toe ailment. Backup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a>, who went 2-0 while Purdy was out, will get the start against Los Angeles. In addition, San Francisco's top two wide receivers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122949/ricky-pearsall/\">Ricky Pearsall</a> (knee) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/\">Jauan Jennings</a> (ankle and rib), also are out for Thursday. That's a potentially devastating blow for an offense already without tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818265/george-kittle/\">George Kittle</a> (hamstring) and receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967489/brandon-aiyuk/\">Brandon Aiyuk</a> (ACL).</p><p>Meanwhile, the Rams are coming off a 27-20 victory over the previously undefeated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>. Los Angeles rallied from a seven-point fourth quarter deficit in that game and capped the comeback with an 88-yard touchdown pass from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965372/tutu-atwell/\">Tutu Atwell</a>.</p><p>The Rams are 8.5-point favorites over the 49ers on Thursday.</p><p>Los Angeles has had the edge in the head-to-head series recently. After losing nine of 10 to San Francisco between October 2019 and September 2023, the Rams have won three in a row against the 49ers. Los Angeles swept the season series last year with fourth quarter comebacks in each game. The Rams' turnover differential during the winning streak has been +2. In the previous 10 games, it was -6.</p><p>Generating turnovers has been an issue for San Francisco; the 49ers have played 11 straight games without intercepting a pass. That's tied for the longest streak in the NFL since at least 1940. Meanwhile, Stafford has thrown 19 touchdowns against just three interceptions over his last 11 games. </p><p>While the Rams-49ers game is the marquee attraction on the sporting landscape on Thursday, there are other viewing options on a three-game MLB playoff slate and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29443591/sam-houston/\">Sam Houston</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NMEXST/new-mexico-state-aggies/\">New Mexico State</a> in college football.</p><p>Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on Thursday, Oct. 2. <em>All times Eastern.</em></p><h2>NFL best bets, where to watch</h2><h3>49ers at Rams</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 8:15 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>Inglewood, Calif. | <strong>TV:</strong> Prime Video | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a> -- Model: </strong>Rams -8.5 | <strong>Expert:</strong> Rams -7 (Will Brinson)</p>\n<p>Los Angeles receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> has been the most productive pass catcher in the league over the first four weeks.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>' vanishing act came in a hurry Sunday against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a>. When the offense took the field for its opening drive of the second half, Los Angeles' 10-0 lead had become a 17-10 deficit in 10 minutes of game time.</p><p>The offensive line would be the next thing to go up in smoke. On first and 10, an unblocked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124180/jordan-magee/\">Jordan Magee</a> came flying in on a blitz, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> quite literally disappeared under a sea of white uniforms and burgundy helmets. It officially went down as a sack by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3169274/johnny-newton/\">Johnny Newton</a>, but any of the four Commanders creating a Herbert sandwich could have been credited.</p><p>No matter. Herbert has bailed the Chargers out plenty of times before, and it looked like he would again, firing a dart to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162609/quentin-johnston/\">Quentin Johnston</a> for 23 yards. The only problem? Right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116462/trey-pipkins/\">Trey Pipkins</a> was called for holding. Instead of a second-and-19 conversion, the Chargers retreated into second and 28.</p><p>And yet there was Herbert again, delivering a 31-yard rainbow to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737096/keenan-allen/\">Keenan Allen</a> to somehow overcome adverse conditions<em> again</em>. The only problem? Stop me if you've heard this before: a flag, this time illegal formation on Pipkins for lining up in the backfield.</p>\n<p>\"We're good enough to overcome some [mistakes], but you need to minimize them,\" Jim Harbaugh said. \"That's an area that we need to get better at.\"</p><p>And now, the Chargers' perfect start -- and status as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> darlings -- has gone AWOL, too. The Chargers fell, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-vs-chargers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-jayden-daniels-justin-herbert/live/\" target=\"_blank\">27-10</a>, to the Commanders on Sunday, and in what's becoming a concerning trend, offensive line play doomed them again. Herbert took four sacks and has taken 16 on the season, tied for second-most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. He was pressured on 38% of his dropbacks Sunday and has faced a 45% pressure rate over the past three weeks.</p><p>The straw has broken the camel's back ... and maybe the Chargers' status as contenders.</p>\n<p>Things began to go awry -- as they seemingly so often do for the Chargers -- in the most painful of ways. Just days after becoming the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-make-lt-rashawn-slater-nfls-highest-paid-offensive-lineman-with-114-million-extension-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history</a></span> a few days into training camp, left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2835704/rashawn-slater/\">Rashawn Slater</a> suffered a season-ending <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-star-lt-rashawn-slater-to-miss-2025-season-after-suffering-torn-patellar-tendon-in-practice/\" target=\"_blank\">torn patellar tendon</a></span>.</p><p>The Chargers cobbled things together by moving <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26713136/joe-alt/\">Joe Alt</a> from right tackle to left tackle, but Alt suffered a high ankle sprain in a Week 4 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>. On Sunday, Pipkins, the fill-in right tackle, and right guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867297/mekhi-becton/\">Mekhi Becton</a>, signed this offseason to fortify the interior of the line, were both in and out of the lineup. Even breakout rookie running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28908905/omarion-hampton/\">Omarion Hampton</a>, handling a workhorse after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741200/najee-harris/\">Najee Harris</a>' season-ending Achilles tear earlier this season, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/omarion-hampton-injury-update-chargers-star-rookie-rb-leaves-game-against-commanders-with-ankle-injury/\" target=\"_blank\">left with an ankle injury</a></span>.</p><p>When the offensive line wasn't an issue, the Chargers operated reasonably efficiently: 5.2 yards per play, nine for 16 on third down and just two punts. Unfortunately, too many of the drives that didn't end in punts didn't end in points, either.</p>\n<ul><li>Up 10-0 early in the second quarter and driving once again, Johnston fumbled at the end of a 19-yard gain.</li><li>Down 20-10 in the third quarter, the Chargers were discombobulated getting out of the huddle on a fourth and 2, and Herbert fired incomplete to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2165249/tyler-conklin/\">Tyler Conklin</a> on a disjointed play. </li><li>Down 20-10 in the fourth quarter, the Chargers drove all the way to the Washington 1-yard line and then went backwards. On third and goal, Herbert's deflected pass got picked off by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121278/mike-sainristil/\">Mike Sainristil</a>. Washington then ripped off a 13-play, 99-yard drive to seal the deal.</li></ul><p>Even with a mishmash offensive line and a significant penalty problem -- 24 for 192 yards over the past two weeks -- Harbaugh said he believes the answers up front are in-house and the issues are fixable. It is only Week 5, after all, Los Angeles is still 3-2 and 3-0 in the AFC West, and Alt could return soon. Herbert has shown he can head an elite offense when he has simply functional support around him.</p><p>\"Concentration, focus in our assignment, our alignment, our technique, all the things that you do as a good football team: things that we have done, that are in our DNA, in our character,\" Harbaugh said. \"When things are happening outside the team's character, [we need] more focus in those areas.\"</p><p>But even he realized that they \"have to get the bleeding stopped.\" Sunday's mistake-filled performance and the M*A*S*H* unit that's trying and failing to protect Herbert showed how quickly things can go from rosy to worrisome in an NFL season.</p>\n<p>The sky isn't falling, but changes and improvement have to happen to ensure these aren't the \"Same Old Chargers,\" a phrase synonymous with a franchise that has seen so many promising seasons go unfulfilled.</p>\n            </div>",

The previously winless Titans came back from down 21-3, and won, 22-21, thanks to a few inexcusable Arizona errors. </p><p>Early in the fourth quarter, Cardinals running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-cardinals-emari-demercado-drops-ball-before-end-zone-on-wide-open-touchdown/\" target=\"_blank\">dropped the football </a></span>before waltzing into the end zone on a wide-open touchdown, which empowered the Titans offense to march 80 yards for their first touchdown in two weeks. Then, down nine points, the Titans turned a Cardinals interception -- <em>into a Tennessee touchdown</em>.</p><p>Following an Arizona three-and-out, rookie quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> marched his offense down to the Cardinals' 20-yard line. Then, Ward had a pass attempt deflected, and picked off by Cardinals safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3127681/dadrion-taylor-demerson/\">Dadrion Taylor-Demerson</a>. However, Taylor-Demerson lost possession of the ball on the ground -- before he was touched -- and it was kicked into the Cardinals end zone, where it was recovered by Titans wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1860834/tyler-lockett/\">Tyler Lockett</a> for a touchdown.</p><p>Check out the insane play, here: </p>\n<p>This play cut the deficit to two points -- after Arizona led by as many as 18. With a slim lead and 4:39 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Cardinals then went conservative. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murrays/\">Kyler Murray's</a> offense picked up 15 yards on six plays, then punted the ball away to the Titans with two minutes remaining in the game.</p><p>Ward, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, then took his offense 71 yards down the field on 11 plays, and set up a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116871/joey-slye/\">Joey Slye</a> game-winning 29-yard field goal for Tennessee's first win since Nov. 24, 2024. </p>\n<p>It was a Cardinals collapse of epic proportions, but credit the Titans for never giving up. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Another Sunday, another full slate of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> action nearly in the books. And boy has Week 5 been chock-full of drama. The reigning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> were upset at home for their first loss of the 2025 season. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> stood no chance in a matchup of AFC foes while star quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> sat out due to injury. And the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a> survived a hard-fought matchup with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> in London, kicking off Sunday festivities that also included <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-darts/\">Jaxson Dart's</a> second career <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> start.</p><p>Dart had a rougher go of it Sunday against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a>, but he was hardly the face of disappointment during Week 5 action. Quite a few others, including his NFC East rival Eagles, arguably suffered more dispiriting defeats during the latest round of regular-season showdowns. Meanwhile others, including a trio of running backs (some more recognizable than others), ran wild to propel their respective teams to victory.</p><p>Here are some of Sunday's biggest Week 5 winners and losers:</p><h2>Winner: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26696165/emeka-egbuka/\">Emeka Egbuka</a></h2><p>Can anyone stop this duo? Mayfield got a fair fight from old Panthers pal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>' matchup with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>, but the former had the last laugh, barely missing through the air (29 of 33) and saving some of his tightest spirals for the final drive. Egbuka, meanwhile, remains one of the chief reasons Mayfield keeps coming through in the clutch, besting even the emergent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162959/jaxon-smith-njigba/\">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</a> with 163 yards on seven catches in Tampa Bay's Week 5 win. Who says the Bucs can't win yet another NFC South title?</p><h2>Loser: Jonathan Gannon and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a></h2><p>It's hard to script losing a 21-3 lead, but it's even harder to script losing it the way Arizona did on Sunday. This was a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/anatomy-of-cardinals-epic-collapse-how-titans-got-first-win-of-2025-season-despite-massive-hole-in-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\">collapse of epic proportions</a></span>, starting with a fumble by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murray/\">Kyler Murray</a>, who wasn't ready for a wayward snap. The worst blunder may have been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-cardinals-emari-demercado-drops-ball-before-end-zone-on-wide-open-touchdown/\" target=\"_blank\">letting go of the football</a></span> before the goal line on a would-be 72-yard touchdown run. But that might be discounting the play where safety Dadrion Taylor-Emerson picked off the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a>, only to then lose the ball and watch Tennessee recover it for a score. The Titans leaving as victors for the first time in 2025 also marked the third straight Arizona loss by a walk-off field goal -- an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> first. Brutal.</p>\n<h2>Winner: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866395/jonathan-taylors/\">Jonathan Taylor's</a> award chances</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> may be the most surprising face of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>' resurgent offense, but the man carrying the ball behind him has been just as, if not more, impressive all year. That continued Sunday in Indianapolis' blowout win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>, in which Taylor scored not once, not twice but three times. That brings his 2025 touchdown total to seven through five games, and he also entered Week 5 as the NFL's rushing leader. A running back may not have great odds to claim NFL MVP honors, but Taylor is on a solid track to securing an Offensive Player of the Year nod.</p><h2>Loser: Ravens fans</h2><p>If you count yourself among Baltimore faithful, Sunday was about as ugly as it gets: Not only was Lamar Jackson not available to carry the Ravens offense with his dual-threat magic, but John Harbaugh had basically no answers otherwise. The opposing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> looked totally lifeless not long ago, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> was dealing like an MVP candidate against the Ravens defense. Granted, key pieces like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180472/roquan-smith/\">Roquan Smith</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2249188/nnamdi-madubuike/\">Nnamdi Madubuike</a> were also missing, but that's part of the problem: The Ravens just don't have the depth to withstand even a few notable losses. All of a sudden this is a 1-4 team with maybe even less immediate hope than the Cleveland Browns.</p><h2>Winner: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> (and ex-Cowboys) RBs</h2><p>Remember during the offseason, when everyone poked fun at Dallas for investing in a pile of retreads at the running back spot? The jabs at Jerry Jones for his past disinterest in paying big bucks to land <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a>? Well, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a> has since taken the top job and run with it, literally. He feasted against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> to the tune of 135 yards and two scores, putting him among the NFL's top rushers of 2025 and setting up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescotts/\">Dak Prescott's</a> pretty day through the air. Meanwhile, in Carolina, former Cowboys reserve <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252798/rico-dowdle/\">Rico Dowdle</a> had a field day against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>, eclipsing 200 yards as the improbable star of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a>' comeback against Miami.</p>\n<h2>Loser: Nick Sirianni and his pass catchers</h2><p>The Eagles were unbeaten playing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a>' not-pretty but efficient brand of football, and then, after a week of tiptoeing around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-browns/\">A.J. Brown's</a> passive-aggressive social-media venting about the club's scattershot passing attack, Sirianni and his staff decided to ... ignore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a>? Brown and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866975/devonta-smith/\">DeVonta Smith</a> got their targets (18 combined), and while Smith was a true weapon against Denver, it was also fitting the two wideouts ended Sunday lying helpless atop each other in the end zone: Philly blowing a 14-point lead to fall to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> was a near-direct result of forcing the ball through the air. Hopefully, for the Eagles' sake, it's a wake-up call for all.</p><h2>Winner: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a></h2><p>The first half of Sunday morning's overseas bout with the Browns was a rough one for Wentz, both literally and figuratively; he showed fight but put his body at risk in the process, leaving just before halftime due to a shoulder injury suffered on a hard-fought scramble. Then the Vikings' emergency starter showed up in a big way near the finish line, continuously feeding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a> before threading a perfect last-minute score to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a> and preventing Minnesota from returning to the States with an 0-2 international mark. Even on the off chance young <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a> returns to full health during the Vikings' bye, Wentz might warrant another start under center.</p><h2>Loser: Mark Davis</h2><p>This was the one year it seemed like the Raiders might actually vault themselves into relevancy in the AFC West, with Davis luring big names at coach (Pete Carroll), quarterback (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a>), offensive coordinator (Chip Kelly) and even minority stakeholder (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a>). Unfortunately, that \"dream team\" has resulted in a 1-4 start, and Sunday's performance was the least competitive of all -- a 40-6 drubbing at the hands of the Colts that saw Smith turn in yet another multi-turnover start. Rather than looking equipped for an immediate push, this Raiders outfit looks like it needs another couple years of deep-seated change. How much longer can Geno stay slinging it?</p>\n            </div>",

The Bills have won five straight AFC East titles and are off to a 4-0 start, with the Patriots in second place at 2-2 this season. Buffalo has dominated the AFC East through offensive prowess over recent seasons, often making their players popular options for anytime touchdown scorer bets, and for Sunday Night Football against the Patriots, the SportsLine model has a few Buffalo players it sees value in to cash in Week 5 anytime TD scorer bets. The Bills are favored by 7.5 points, according to the latest NFL odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5.</p><p>One of the SportsLine model's top anytime TD scorer picks is Bills running back James Cook. Many football pundits questioned Cook's ability to repeat last year's season, where he led the NFL with 16 rushing touchdowns. His response? Leading the NFL in rushing touchdowns (five) through four weeks this season, including at least one touchdown in all four games. The model expects that trend to continue, and even at -213 odds at Caesars Sportsbook, the model views Cook as a value for Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorer picks for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">online sports betting</a>.</p><p>Before making any Patriots vs. Bills picks or anytime touchdown scorer props at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a>, be sure to see the Week 5 NFL predictions from SportsLine's proven model and see the latest <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL odds</a>.

He also enters Week 5 second in the NFL in rushing yards (401) and fourth in carries (75) as the Bills are making him work for that four-year, $48 million extension he signed in the offseason. Cook led the league in rushing touchdowns (16) last season, including three total touchdowns and at least one score in each matchup against New England.</p><p>Cook rushed for 100 yards on 9.1 yards per carry and had a rushing and receiving touchdown in the Bills' 24-21 win over the Patriots in Buffalo last year. He had at least one touchdown in six of eight games played in Buffalo last season. and with the Bills being 8.5-point favorites on Sunday Night Football, they could be in a run script with plenty of scoring opportunities for Cook. Caesars Sportsbook offers the best odds on Cook scoring a touchdown at -213, and with the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Caesars Sportsbook promo code</a></span>, new users receive <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=caesars&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">20 100% sportsbook profit boosts with a $1 bet with the promo code CBS20X</a>.</p><h2>Hunter Henry, Patriots (+235)</h2><p>Henry has three of New England's seven receiving touchdowns this season, and he's scored at least one touchdown in each of the last two weeks. The 30-year-old tight end was the focal point of the Patriots' offense two weeks ago with eight receptions on 11 targets for 90 yards and two touchdowns against the Steelers. Although he was only targeted twice last week against the Panthers, they both resulted in receptions, including a 31-yard touchdown. </p><p>The Patriots only had to throw 18 times in their 42-13 victory over the Panthers last week. You shouldn't expect that trend to continue against the high-flying Bills offense, as New England could be in throw scripts and needing to score often. Henry leads the Patriots with 24 targets and only trails Stefon Diggs in receptions and receiving yards. DraftKings is offering Henry to score a touchdown at +235 odds, and with the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>, new users earn <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">$200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins</a>. </p><h2>Dalton Kincaid, Bills (+235)</h2><p>Josh Allen has spread the ball around the offense through the first four weeks of the season, but Kincaid is certainly among the first options he's looking for. The Buffalo tight end is third in receptions, targets and receiving yards, while leading the Bills with three touchdowns. He has nearly half (3 of 7) of Buffalo's receiving scores this season. The 25-year-old has a touchdown in three of four games this year, including each of the last two contests.</p><p>Kincaid is averaging a career-high 44.8 receiving yards per game in his third NFL season as he's taken a key role in the offense. The Patriots have allowed two touchdowns to tight ends already this season, and they've allowed the seventh-most receiving yards to tight ends this season. The model expects Buffalo to create advantageous matchups for Henry on Sunday Night Football while finding the end zone. DraftKings is offering Kincaid to score a touchdown at +235 odds, and with the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>, new users earn <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">$200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins</a>. </p><h2>Want more Week 5 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Bills vs. Patriots in Week 5 Sunday Night Football.

meeting between reigning champions Arsenal and the record eight-time winners OL Lyonnes. It may be early in the season but this game comes at a fascinating juncture for both teams – Lyon are off to a perfect start in league play under new manager Jonatan Giraldez and after a busy summer, acquiring the likes of Lily Yohannes, Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Jule Brand in the hopes of winning their first Champions League title since 2022. Their roster is undoubtedly stacked but the true test of Lyon's mettle always comes in European competition, so Tuesday's match offers Giraldez a first chance to discover what his best starting lineup actually looks like.</p><p>As for Arsenal, the luster of their first-ever Champions League win has not exactly faded – they supplemented that triumph with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-results-psgs-ousmane-dembele-barcelonas-aitana-bonmati-take-home-awards-make-history/live/\">Women's Club of the Year awards at the Ballon d'Or ceremony</a> just two weeks ago – but this season has not been a breeze to start. They have just two wins out of five to start the Women's Super League season and are winless in their last three, troubling form ahead of a top-tier clash in Europe. The Gunners have the ability to keep things competitive on Tuesday, boasting a squad with back-to-back European champions Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly and Ballon d'Or runner-up Mariona Caldentey. Whether they put all the pieces in time for their Champions League opener, though, is a huge question.</p><p><strong>USWNT players in the UWCL:</strong> A handful of U.S. women's national team players will take part in the Champions League this season, many of them on teams with their sights set on the ultimate prize. Tuesday's marquee matchup between Arsenal and Lyon will showcase just that as the Gunners' Emily Fox faces Lyon's Lindsey Heaps and Lily Yohannes, the latter of whom could make her UWCL debut for her new club after a handful of reps at Ajax.</p><p>Alyssa Thompson, meanwhile, could make her competition debut when Chelsea travel to Twente, while USWNT teammates <span>Naomi Girma</span> and Catarina Macario could also feature.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Injuries are starting to pile up in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> as we are now in Week 5, and we've seen quite a few notable quarterbacks sidelined in particular. If you're interested in <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a></span>, you need to be aware of who's in and who's out before you place any wagers.</p><p>Here, we break down the biggest NFL injuries to know for all of the Week 5 games on Sunday and Monday, including where lines currently stand, according to the latest <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine consensus odds</a>, which uses the latest data and odds from <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">top sportsbooks</a></span>. This post will be updated as official inactives lists are announced before kickoff. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a> (9:30 a.m. ET, in London)</h3><ul><li>MINN QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/jj-mccarthy/\">JJ McCarthy</a> (ankle, out)</li><li>MINN C <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893142/ryan-kelly/\">Ryan Kelly</a> (concussion, out)</li><li>MINN OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136495/brian-oneill/\">Brian O'Neill</a> (knee, out)</li><li>MINN OG <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26702924/donovan-jackson/\">Donovan Jackson</a> (wrist, out)</li><li>CLE CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966771/greg-newsome-ii/\">Greg Newsome II</a> (hamstring, will play)</li></ul>\n<p>The Vikings remain overseas for their second European game in a row, this time against the Browns. Minnesota is reeling on offense, with starting quarterback JJ McCarthy out for the third week in a row with an ankle injury, meaning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a> will start once again. Additionally, the Vikings will be down three starting offensive linemen against a very good Browns defensive front headlined by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139869/myles-garrett/\">Myles Garrett</a>. The biggest Browns injury was starting cornerback Greg Newsome II, as the Vikings have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a> and got <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a> back last week, but he is active.</p><p>The Vikings are 3.5-point favorites, according to SportsLine consensus odds, and the total is just 35.5, by far the lowest over/under of the entire Week 5 slate. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>BAL QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>BAL CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139775/marlon-humphrey/\">Marlon Humphrey</a> (calf, out)</li><li>BAL CB Chidobe Aquzie (hamstring, out)</li><li>BAL LB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180472/roquan-smith/\">Roquan Smith</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>BAL FB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818911/patrick-ricard/\">Patrick Ricard</a> (calf, out)</li><li>BAL S <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3136877/kyle-hamilton/\">Kyle Hamilton</a> (groin, out) </li><li>BAL OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2005667/ronnie-stanley/\">Ronnie Stanley</a> (ankle, out) <br /></li></ul>\n<p>The Ravens are beat up, to say the least. Baltimore will be looking to get to 2-3 on the year when they host the Texans, but the Ravens will be without most of their top stars. Quarterback Lamar Jackson is out, so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000176/cooper-rush/\">Cooper Rush</a> will start. Additionally, both of the team's starting cornerbacks are out, as are top linebacker Roquan Smith, star safety Kyle Hamilton and left tackle Ronnie Stanley. The Texans, meanwhile, are relatively healthy, especially in comparison to Baltimore.</p><p>With so many players out on the Ravens side, Houston is now a 1.5-point favorite on the road.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>CAR RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865693/chuba-hubbard/\">Chuba Hubbard</a> (calf, out)</li><li>MIA WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/\">Tyreek Hill</a> (knee, out for season)</li></ul>\n<p>The Dolphins will be without one of the top play makers in the NFL after star receiver Tyreek Hill dislocated his knee on Monday. Hill is out not just this week, but for the rest of 2025 with an eye towards returning in early 2026. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2962110/jaylen-waddle/\">Jaylen Waddle</a> will now step into the WR1 role for Miami.</p><p>Carolina is without top running back Chuba Hubbard this week against the Dolphins, opening the door for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252798/rico-dowdle/\">Rico Dowdle</a> to get the bulk of the carries for the Panthers. </p><p>Miami is favored by 1.5 points in Carolina, and the total is set at 44.5.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>LV TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693971/brock-bowers/\">Brock Bowers</a> (knee, out)</li><li>LV TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171673/michael-mayer/\">Michael Mayer</a> (concussion, out)</li><li>LV CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871751/eric-stokes/\">Eric Stokes</a> (knee, out)</li><li>IND CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818965/kenny-moore/\">Kenny Moore</a> (Achilles, out)</li></ul>\n<p>The Raiders are without star tight end Brock Bowers this week. The second-year pro was questionable with a knee injury and won't go for this one, and making matters more complicated is his backup, Michael Mayer, is also out. Vegas also listed starting cornerback Eric Stokes as questionable, and he's out as well.</p><p>The Colts are without a few players Sunday, none more notable than star nickel corner Kenny Moore.  </p><p>Indianapolis is a 7-point favorite on Sunday and the total is set at 48.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>NO TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186637/juwan-johnson/\">Juwan Johnson</a> (ankle, will play)</li><li>NO TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818935/taysom-hill/\">Taysom Hill</a> (knee, will play)</li><li>NO TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180634/foster-moreau/\">Foster Moreau</a> (knee, will play)</li><li>NYG RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963637/tyrone-tracy-jr/\">Tyrone Tracy Jr</a>. (shoulder, out)</li><li>NYG DT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239523/dexter-lawrence/\">Dexter Lawrence</a> (illness, questionable) </li></ul>\n<p>The Saints listed each of their three top tight ends as questionable, but all three of Juwan Johnson, Foster Moreau and Taysom Hill, the jack-of-all-trades former quarterback, will play this week. It will be Hill's 2025 debut.</p><p>As for the Giants, running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. is out once again this week, so rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/\">Cam Skattebo</a> will get the bulk of the carries for New York once again. \"Sexy Dexy\" Dexter Lawrence, arguably the Giants' top defensive player, was questionable with an illness but will play.</p><p>New Orleans is favored by 1.5 as it looks for its first win of 2025.  </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>DAL WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> (ankle, out)</li><li>DAL OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161811/tyler-guyton/\">Tyler Guyton</a> (concussion, out)</li><li>DAL OG <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28912071/tyler-booker/\">Tyler Booker</a> (ankle, out)  </li><li>DAL WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180870/kavontae-turpin/\">KaVontae Turpin</a> (foot, out)</li><li>NYJ RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26726580/braelon-allen/\">Braelon Allen</a> (knee, injured reserve)</li></ul>\n<p>The Cowboys' offense is hurting entering Sunday. Dallas is without star receiver CeeDee Lamb for the second week in a row, and the team is also down two starting offensive linemen in Tyler Guyton and Tyler Booker. Dallas' receiver room is also down KaVontae Turpin, so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/\">George Pickens</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2868238/jalen-tolbert/\">Jalen Tolbert</a> will get the bulk of the looks for the Cowboys in the passing game alongside tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867159/jake-ferguson/\">Jake Ferguson</a>.</p><p>The total here is 47.5, and Dallas is a 1.5-point favorite. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (1 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>No notable injuries</li></ul>\n<p>The Broncos and Eagles both enter this game in great spots in the health department in what could be one of the games of the week. The Broncos are 2-2 and haven't looked like the playoff team we saw a year ago, but the talent is obviously there. The Eagles are one of two 4-0 teams left as they defend their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> title, but they've been playing with fire in the early stages of 2025.</p><p>Philly is a 4.5-point favorite entering the weekend. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> (4:05 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>TENN WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186328/calvin-ridley/\">Calvin Ridley</a> (elbow, will play)</li><li>TENN RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122588/tyjae-spears/\">Tyjae Spears</a> (ankle, will play)</li><li>TENN OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694508/jc-latham/\">JC Latham</a> (hip, out)</li><li>AZ RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a> (ankle, injured reserve)</li><li>AZ CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1906884/will-johnson/\">Will Johnson</a> (groin, will play)</li></ul>\n<p>The Titans' offense has been awful to begin the year, and it will once again be without tackle JC Latham. The good news is receiver Calvin Ridley is active, as is running back Tyjae Spears, who will be making his 2025 debut.</p><p>As for the Cardinals, their running back contingency plan is being tested. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a> is out for the year, which opened the door for second-year back Trey Benson. Unfortunately for the Cards, Benson injured his ankle last week, so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804075/michael-carter/\">Michael Carter</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> are expected to get the bulk of the touches out of the backfield moving forward.</p><p>Arizona is a 7.5-point favorite over the visiting Titans, while the total is 41.5.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> (4:05 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>TB RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/\">Bucky Irving</a> (foot, out)</li><li>TB WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>TB CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179803/jamel-dean/\">Jamel Dean</a> (hip, out)</li><li>TB CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28924605/benjamin-morrison/\">Benjamin Morrison</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>SEA CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3137159/devon-witherspoon/\">Devon Witherspoon</a> (knee, out)</li><li>SEA S <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260683/julian-love/\">Julian Love</a> (hamstring, out)</li><li>SEA DL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1984683/demarcus-lawrence/\">DeMarcus Lawrence</a> (quad, out)</li></ul>\n<p>Two 3-1 squads will be without key players in the Pacific Northwest on Sunday. The Bucs will again be without star receiver Mike Evans, but they'll also be without standout running back Bucky Irving, paving the way for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3169147/rachaad-white/\">Rachaad White</a> to assume lead back duties for Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers will also be without two of their top cornerbacks.</p><p>Seattle is also hurting in the secondary, with top cornerback Devon Witherspoon and starting safety Julian Love both out against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> and Co. Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence will also be out on Sunday.</p><p>The Seahawks are 3.5-point favorites at home, and the total is 44.5 </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> (4:25 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>DET OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1983776/taylor-decker/\">Taylor Decker</a> (shoulder, out)</li><li>DET S <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961816/kerby-joseph/\">Kerby Joseph</a> (knee, will play)</li><li>CIN DL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923420/shemar-stewart/\">Shemar Stewart</a> (ankle, out)</li></ul>\n<p>Two key Detroit starters were questionable here, and starting left tackle Taylor Decker is out against the Bengals while safety Kerby Joseph is set to play.

That's especially true here, with Detroit favored by 10.5 on the road.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> (4:25 p.m. ET)</h3><ul><li>WAS WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139279/terry-mclaurin/\">Terry McLaurin</a> (quad, out)</li><li>WAS WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139270/noah-brown/\">Noah Brown</a> (groin and knee, out)</li><li>LAC OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26713136/joe-alt/\">Joe Alt</a> (ankle, out)</li><li>LAC OG <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867297/mekhi-becton/\">Mekhi Becton</a> (concussion, will play)</li></ul>\n<p>The good news for the Commanders -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> is back after missing the last two weeks with a knee injury. The bad news is he's down a few weapons in the passing game. Top Washington receiver Terry McLaurin is out for the second straight week, and Noah Brown is also down.

The Baltimore Ravens, who were tabbed by most to be Super Bowl contenders this year, suddenly look like they might be contending for the No. 1 overall pick instead. With their 44-10 loss to the Houston Texans, the Ravens' season might have just hit rock bottom. </p><ul><li>The Ravens are surrendering 35.4 points per game this year, which is 11th-most in NFL history through five games. </li><li>The Ravens have surrendered at least 37 points in four of their first give games, which makes them the first team in 71 years to do that. </li></ul><p>Not surprisingly, the Ravens did NOT get a good grade this week. The Ravens were one of three AFC North teams that lost on Sunday along with the Bengals and Browns. So we'll go ahead and give the Steelers an 'A+' for their bye week. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, let's get to the rest of our Week 5 grades, starting with the game in Baltimore. </p><h2>Houston 44-10 over Baltimore</h2><h2>Detroit 37-24 over Cincinnati</h2><h2>Washington 27-10 over L.A.

The Chiefs may be playing a different style of football than before, but what they are doing better than ever is protecting the ball. No team entered Week 5 with fewer turnovers than the one Kansas City has on the year, and the team is riding a 39-game win streak when winning the turnover battle, which is the third-longest streak by any team since 1960.</p><p>The Chiefs offense finally broke out last week as the 37 points they put on Baltimore were the most by the team in over two calendar years. In that contest, Mahomes became the fastest player to reach 250 career touchdown passes (116 games), and a good chunk of those have come on Monday nights. He owns a 27:8 TD:INT on Monday Night Football and has torched the Jaguars to historic proportions. Mahomes is the only quarterback since 1950 to be 5-0, or better, versus one team with a 70% completion rate and an average of at least 300 passing yards per game. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/underdog/\" target=\"_blank\">Underdog promo code</a></span>, good for <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\">$100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2</a></em> in select states.</p><h2>Why the Jaguars can cover</h2><p>After ranking dead last in takeaways last season, the Jaguars have done a complete reversal and now lead the NFL with 13 takeaways entering Week 5. Not only that, but they have the best turnover differential (+9) in the NFL, and no stat correlates more with winning and losing than turnover differential. Under first-year defensive coordinator, Anthony Campanile, Jacksonville has the No. 4 run defense, the No. 5 scoring defense and ranks sixth in redzone defense.</p><p>On offense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has been sacked just three times, which is the fewest of any qualified quarterback. The former No. 1 overall pick has also risen to the challenge of being an underdog as he is 5-2-1 against the spread as an underdog over the last two seasons. He's complemented in the backfield by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a>, whose 6.1 yards per carry lead the NFL as the Jags have the No. 4 rushing offense. Their commitment to the run and the ability to produce on the ground game could eat up the clock and keep Mahomes and company off the field. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Chiefs vs. Jaguars picks</h2><p>For Jaguars vs. Chiefs on Monday Night Football, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 45 combined points.

Yesavage struck out 11 in 5 ⅓ no-hit innings on Sunday against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> in Game 2 of the American League Division Series (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/playbyplay/MLB_20251005_NYY@TOR/\">GameTracker</a>). That strikeout total easily set a new Blue Jays record in a playoff game.</p><p>Indeed, Yesavage tied the old mark (eight) to begin his fourth inning of work. He then struck out the next batter, taking the record for himself, and the batter after that, to create further separation. Previously, the Blue Jays franchise had witnessed four eight-strikeout contests. The most recent of which occurred 10 years ago, when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1232130/david-price/\">David Price</a> struck out eight batters apiece in a pair of American League Championship Series starts against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/\">Kansas City Royals</a>:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Pitcher</th><th>Series</th><th>Strikeouts</th><th>IP</th></tr><tr><td><p>Trey Yesavage</p></td><td><p>2025 ALDS G2 vs. NYY</p></td><td><p>10+</p></td><td><p>4+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Juan Guzmán</p></td><td><p>1992 ALCS G6 vs. OAK</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>David Price</p></td><td><p>2015 ALCS G2 vs. KCR</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>6 2/3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>David Price</p></td><td><p>2015 ALCS G6 vs. KCR</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>6 2/3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dave Stieb</p></td><td><p>1985 ALCS G1 vs. KCR</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>8</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>\"This has got to be cloud nine. I couldn't imagine a better feeling right now,\" Yesavage said after the game. \"... I was sitting in there thinking about the comment I made the other day, where I said I'm built for this. And I was like, well, I'd better back that up. I wanted to go out there and do the best I possibly could. Thankfully it stayed true to that.\"</p><p>Yesavage, 22, made just three major-league appearances during the regular season. He compiled a 3.21 ERA (136 ERA+) and a 2.29 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 14 innings. It's notable that none of those starts came against the Yankees, or, for that matter, any other team he could face this postseason.</p>\n<p>For those wondering, Yesavage's Game 2 gem also represented the first time in franchise history a pitcher 23 years or younger struck out more than five batters in a playoff contest.</p><p>\"That was nasty stuff,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after the game. \"That split is unlike much you ever run into. He got it going, starting it up a lot, breaking it down off the plate, using his fastball enough and slider enough. But we just didn't have an answer for the split. He was on his game.\"</p><p>Yesavage entered the spring ranked by CBS Sports as the No. 1 prospect in the Blue Jays system. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/toronto-blue-jays-top-prospects-2025-patience-development-needed-for-high-upside-system/\">Here's what we wrote at the time</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Blue Jays plucked Yesavage with the 20th pick in last summer's draft after an impressive career at East Carolina University that saw him return to action shortly after suffering a partially collapsed lung. His game is built on verticality: beginning with his steep release point and extending to an arsenal that includes, among other pitches, a rising fastball, a hammer curve, and a split-change. Yesavage hasn't yet made his professional debut, but he ought to move quickly once he does.</p></blockquote><p>The Blue Jays held on for a 13-7 win to take a 2-0 advantage in the best-of-five series. </p>\n            </div>",

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> erased a 14-point deficit to upset the Philadelphia Eagles (and hand them their first loss of the season), while the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> rallied from 17 down to defeat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> won't go winless, as the Titans mounted a storming comeback to beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>.

Which ones are really overreactions and which are reality?</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> on the heels of another collapse</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality: </strong>Overreaction</p><p>The Eagles finally lost a game, but this was one they were supposed to win. Philadelphia was up 17-3 over Denver in the fourth quarter before allowing 18 unanswered points in a 21-17 loss -- their first of the season. The offense changed it up this week, throwing the ball 37 times and running just 11. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> had a career-low six carries in a game he started and finished.</p>\n<p>The Eagles clearly aren't on the same page offensively, and it's showing week to week. After going up 17-3, the offense ran 14 plays for 27 yards -- punting four times. The defense, in turn, allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nix/\">Bo Nix</a> to go 9 of 10 for 127 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter (152.1 rating). The Broncos scored two touchdowns and a field goal on their final three possessions, as the Eagles' defense couldn't get off the field.</p><p>Philadelphia has been outgained in every game this season, yet is somehow 4-1. The Eagles don't turn the ball over, but they're keeping teams in games thanks to offensive inconsistency and an inability to find the right mix of passing and running. They also haven't gotten Barkley going, which is a major problem.</p><p>Does this mean the Eagles are collapsing? No. This team is talented and making enough plays to win games. The schedule gets easier before the bye week, and there's a good chance they'll be 7-1 by November.</p>\n<p>The offense has issues that need fixing, but this Eagles team isn't collapsing despite the yardage differential and inconsistency. Sunday's game should have been a win, but this group has still emerged victorious in 20 of its past 22 games.</p><p>No collapse is happening in Philadelphia.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-5-grades-scores-results-highlights-broncos-eagles-ravens-texans/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 5 grades: Broncos earn 'A-' for stunning win over Eagles, Ravens get a big 'F' for ugly loss</p>\n                <p>\n                    John Breech                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NFL Week 5 grades: Broncos earn 'A-' for stunning win over Eagles, Ravens get a big 'F' for ugly loss\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/05/0c19ad5a-c8ae-4cf5-85af-2bcd3b0e16fa/thumbnail/270x152/f120c2c06b78f2efcfd241df4096b2b9/broncos-jpeg.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Aaron Glenn won't last the season as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> coach </h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality: </strong>Overreaction</p><p>Glenn has been a hot topic in the overreaction room over the past few weeks, especially since the Jets have looked abysmal every single week. They were down 30-3 late in the third quarter in Sunday's loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>, falling to 0-5 on the season -- and failing to record a single takeaway in any game (Glenn is a defensive coach).</p><p>The list of coaches to start a season 0-5 with the Jets? Adam Gase (2020), Rich Kotite (1996) and Walt Michaels (1980). That's not a very encouraging sign for Glenn, even if he's in his first year as a head coach. Things may be getting even worse for New York, as it heads overseas to face Denver -- which just handed Philadelphia its first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>The Jets were noncompetitive in this one and ill-prepared. The message Glenn is trying to send isn't resonating with this locker room, and the culture is nonexistent. There's little reason to believe in Glenn at this point.</p><p>Even though the Jets look like the worst team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, they have the Panthers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> after they get back from London. Let's reserve full judgment on Glenn, but if they lose both of those games, he may not survive the bye week.</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> will bench <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> at some point this year</h2>\n<p><strong>Overreaction or reality: </strong>Reality</p><p>Smith was supposed to be a good trade for the Raiders, who picked up a veteran quarterback who could be a bridge signal-caller for a year or two as Pete Carroll looked to establish an identity in Las Vegas.

He has six touchdowns to nine interceptions and a 75.6 passer rating through five games, ranking 27th out of 30 qualified quarterbacks in passer rating and first in interceptions (by three over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a>, who was benched).</p><p>The Raiders don't have a good roster, but Smith was supposed to be better.

In a weekend full of bad performances, the Ravens' defense may have been the worst of all -- giving up 44 points to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> at home.</p><p>Baltimore's defense is the reason the Ravens are 1-4, as they've given up 37-plus points in four of their first five games. They are the first team in 71 years to allow 37 or more points in four of their first five games and are allowing 35.4 points per game this season.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/koestreicher34/status/1974941766844600577\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Van Noy gave a noncommittal answer on Orr</a>, and John Harbaugh is doubling down on his defensive coordinator. Truth is, the Ravens just aren't competitive -- and were bad on defense even before they were missing five starters.</p>\n<p>This defense isn't good, and getting players healthy won't fix all the issues. Orr shouldn't survive this season, not while underperforming with this much talent on defense.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-suffer-complete-disappointment-after-34-point-loss-the-second-worst-defeat-of-john-harbaugh-era/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Ravens suffer 'complete disappointment' after 34-point loss, the second-worst defeat of John Harbaugh era</p>\n                <p>\n                    Bryan DeArdo                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Ravens suffer 'complete disappointment' after 34-point loss, the second-worst defeat of John Harbaugh era\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/05/dccdaa58-48b7-4d7a-9a20-aec0fee0a6d6/thumbnail/270x152/8fd7474ef7391339567ef85e2c96dcdf/harbaugh25.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252798/rico-dowdle/\">Rico Dowdle</a> should start over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865693/chuba-hubbard/\">Chuba Hubbard</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Overreaction or reality: </strong>Overreaction</p><p>Getting Dowdle in this conversation showcases the amazing day he had. Dowdle led Carolina's comeback victory over Miami, rushing for 206 yards -- the second-most in a player's first start with a team since 1970.</p><p>Dowdle torched the Dolphins' run defense, averaging 9.0 yards per carry and adding 74 rushing yards and a score in the fourth quarter. Thanks to Dowdle, the Panthers are 2-3. Should they go to him as the RB1 over Chuba Hubbard if he's healthy enough to return next week?</p>\n<p>The Dolphins' run defense isn't very good, which is why Dowdle had such a big day. They rank 30th in the NFL in yards per carry allowed (5.6), 29th in yards before contact per attempt (2.03) and 28th in yards after contact per attempt (3.56). This isn't a good unit, which makes Dowdle's performance somewhat deceiving.</p><p>Dowdle deserves more touches, but he shouldn't be thrust into the RB1 role just yet.</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26696165/emeka-egbuka/\">Emeka Egbuka</a> will break the rookie receiving yards record </h2>\n<p><strong>Overreaction or reality: </strong>Reality</p><p>Look out, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> -- Emeka Egbuka is coming for your mark of 1,486 receiving yards, the most ever by a rookie in league history. Egbuka was dominant in Tampa Bay's thrilling win over Seattle, catching seven passes for 163 yards and a touchdown. This was Egbuka's second straight game with 100-plus receiving yards -- and the second straight game in which he had a 50-plus-yard reception.</p>\n<p>Simply put, Egbuka is figuring things out in the NFL. He has 25 catches for 459 yards and five touchdowns through five games -- an average of 18.4 yards per catch. He's averaging 91.8 receiving yards per game and is on pace for 1,561 yards this season.</p><p>The Buccaneers already have a WR1 in Egbuka, and he'll keep getting targeted with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> slinging the ball downfield and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> sidelined with a hamstring injury. They may already have a top-10 wideout in the NFL, and Egbuka is showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p>If Egbuka doesn't hit the rookie wall, he'll get that record.</p>\n<h2>Jonathan Gannon won't last past this season in Arizona</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality: </strong>Reality</p><p>The Cardinals looked strong with a 2-0 start, even with unimpressive victories over the Saints and Panthers. Then they lost a pair of one-score games to division foes -- the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> and Seahawks -- both on walk-off field goals.</p>\n<p>Arizona lost to Tennessee on a walk-off field goal Sunday to fall to 2-3, but this one should have been preventable. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-cardinals-emari-demercado-drops-ball-before-end-zone-on-wide-open-touchdown/\" target=\"_blank\">dropped a ball going into the end zone that resulted in a turnover</a></span> -- and would have put Arizona up 28-6 in the fourth quarter. The Cardinals then either fumbled or punted on six of their final eight possessions. They also allowed Cameron Ward to go 13 of 18 for 193 yards in the fourth quarter, including the game-winning drive that set up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116871/joey-slyes/\">Joey Slye's</a> walk-off field goal.</p>\n<p>The Titans are one of the worst teams in the NFL, and the Cardinals blew a commanding lead at home. For a team that needs to either make the playoffs or be competitive enough to push for one, that can't happen.</p><p>The losses are close, but Gannon has little wiggle room. He needs to turn this around, or his tenure with the Cardinals won't last much longer.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/anatomy-of-cardinals-epic-collapse-how-titans-got-first-win-of-2025-season-despite-massive-hole-in-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Anatomy of Cardinals' epic collapse: How Titans got first win of 2025 season despite massive hole in Arizona</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Benjamin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Anatomy of Cardinals' epic collapse: How Titans got first win of 2025 season despite massive hole in Arizona\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/05/9f5be22a-2729-45d7-ba10-f346e7359c5d/thumbnail/270x152/a864a7e29732fe0f5befee0b7af8756d/titans.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n            </div>",

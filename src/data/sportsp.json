This marked victory No. 1 for Moore as coach, and the Saints' first win since Week 14 last year, which coincidentally also came against the Giants. Sunday was also historical for quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125863/spencer-rattler/\">Spencer Rattler</a>.</p><p>According to CBS Sports Research, Rattler is the first quarterback drafted by the Saints to win a game with the Saints since 1998. The last quarterback to accomplish this was Danny Wuerffel, who was selected by New Orleans in the fourth round of the 1997 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>.</p><p>Rattler was selected by the Saints in the fifth round back in 2024 out of South Carolina. He entered this week 0-10 as a starter for the Saints, but finally found that elusive first victory in front of his home fans. Rattler completed 20 of 30 passes for 225 yards and one touchdown on Sunday, and added 21 yards on the ground. </p><p>New Orleans went 0 for 3 in the red zone, but did win the turnover battle 5-0. In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-darts/\">Jaxson Dart's</a> offense turned the ball over on five straight possessions during a horrific stretch that lasted from the second quarter to the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p>It wasn't the cleanest victory of all time, but it was an important victory for the Saints in more ways than one.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

The Chiefs may be playing a different style of football than before, but what they are doing better than ever is protecting the ball. No team entered Week 5 with fewer turnovers than the one Kansas City has on the year, and the team is riding a 39-game win streak when winning the turnover battle, which is the third-longest streak by any team since 1960.</p><p>The Chiefs offense finally broke out last week as the 37 points they put on Baltimore were the most by the team in over two calendar years. In that contest, Mahomes became the fastest player to reach 250 career touchdown passes (116 games), and a good chunk of those have come on Monday nights. He owns a 27:8 TD:INT on Monday Night Football and has torched the Jaguars to historic proportions. Mahomes is the only quarterback since 1950 to be 5-0, or better, versus one team with a 70% completion rate and an average of at least 300 passing yards per game. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/underdog/\" target=\"_blank\">Underdog promo code</a></span>, good for <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\">$100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2</a></em> in select states.</p><h2>Why the Jaguars can cover</h2><p>After ranking dead last in takeaways last season, the Jaguars have done a complete reversal and now lead the NFL with 13 takeaways entering Week 5. Not only that, but they have the best turnover differential (+9) in the NFL, and no stat correlates more with winning and losing than turnover differential. Under first-year defensive coordinator, Anthony Campanile, Jacksonville has the No. 4 run defense, the No. 5 scoring defense and ranks sixth in redzone defense.</p><p>On offense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has been sacked just three times, which is the fewest of any qualified quarterback. The former No. 1 overall pick has also risen to the challenge of being an underdog as he is 5-2-1 against the spread as an underdog over the last two seasons. He's complemented in the backfield by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a>, whose 6.1 yards per carry lead the NFL as the Jags have the No. 4 rushing offense. Their commitment to the run and the ability to produce on the ground game could eat up the clock and keep Mahomes and company off the field. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Chiefs vs. Jaguars picks</h2><p>For Jaguars vs. Chiefs on Monday Night Football, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 45 combined points.

Rachaad White will slide back into the starting role at running back after piling up over 2,500 scrimmage yards and scoring 18 touchdowns the last two seasons. Meanwhile, Chris Godwin returned from a knee injury last week and Emeka Egbuka has emerged as a NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate to soften the blow of losing Evans. Seattle has been turnover-prone and that's a big reason why <strong>the model has Tampa Bay winning in 45% of simulations despite an implied win probability of 40%</strong>.</p><p>David Montgomery over 53.5 total rushing yards in Lions vs. Bengals (-110)</p><p>\"Lions RB David Montgomery is excited to be playing for the first time in his hometown of Cincinnati. Montgomery grew up rooting for the Bengals, but is likely to be their nemesis in this matchup. The Bengals have allowed 150+ rushing yards to opposing RBs in consecutive weeks,\" SportsLine NFL expert Daniel Vithlani said. \"Montgomery has spoken in interviews about his sister (who was paralyzed in a car accident) coming to watch him play this Sunday. He will have all the motivation in the world to go off for a big game, and I expect a player's coach like Dan Campbell to feed him the rock, knowing what this game means to him. I like Monty to surpass this rushing yards total, and to score against Cincy.\"</p><p>Over 47 points: Chargers vs. Commanders (-110)</p><p>Justin Herbert looked out of sorts in a stunning loss to the Giants last week, but he'd been playing arguably the best football of his career leading up to that point. Meanwhile, the Commanders are expected to get Jayden Daniels back after he missed the last two weeks with a knee injury. This has the potential to be a great quarterback duel and <strong>the model predicts that the Over hits in 53% of simulations</strong>.</p><h2>Want more college football picks for Sunday, October 5?</h2><p><strong>You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

Day, 46, has now won 88.2% of his games as Ohio State's coach, surpassing former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> coach Knute Rockne as college football's all-time leader in career winning percentage. However, he is not in the official NCAA record books just yet because NCAA requires a minimum of 10 years to earn a spot in its record book for this stat.</p><p>When asked about making history, Day joked about ending his coaching career on a high note. </p><p>\"Glad you brought that up, because this is the last game I'll ever be coaching at Ohio State,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/CFBONFOX/status/1974696162302284100\" target=\"_blank\">he said with a smile</a>. \"I'm gonna hang it up and that's it. I'm gonna do a walk off right now.\"</p>\n<p>To the chagrin of Ohio State's opponents, Day was in fact joking. </p><p>\"No, a long way to go,\" he continued. \"[The record] has everything to do with the players, the coaches in this place. When you recognize how long some of those coaches coached, and you recognize what they went through, the seasons and the different changes, you just can appreciate how long they coached. And, you know, some of these seasons here are like dog years at Ohio State, but but I'm just fortunate to be here.\"</p><p>Now in his seventh full season at Ohio State, Day has won 75 of his 85 games as the Buckeyes' coach. Last season, he joined Paul Brown, Woody Hayes, Jim Tressel and Urban Meyer as Buckeyes coaches who won at national title during their time in Columbus. </p><p>Day's only Kryptonite at Ohio State has been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>, as he is 1-4 against the Buckeyes' main rival. But after losing The Game last year, Ohio State has responded with nine straight wins that included becoming the first team to win a national title in college football's expanded playoff format. </p>\n<p>In the playoffs, Ohio State outscored their opponents 145-75, a dominant showing by a team that many left for dead after their loss to Michigan. Ohio State has continued to roll this season, outscoring their first five opponents 187-25. The Buckeyes' offense is averaging over 37 points per game thus far, while the defense -- led by former NFL coach Matt Patricia -- has yet to allow a team to score over 10 points. </p><p>The Buckeyes' current winning streak has not only put Day in the history books, but it's cemented his place among the greatest coaches in Ohio State history. </p><p>And he's not done yet. </p><p>\"I know what the obligation is,\" he said. \"I know what the expectation is, and so do these players and coaches, so we'll just keep swinging away.\"</p>\n            </div>",

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a>' Pro Bowl running back continued to make history Sunday when he tied Walter Payton for fifth all-time in career rushing touchdowns. </p><p>Henry and Payton now stand side-by-side with 110 career rushing touchdowns. Henry matched Payton with a one-yard touchdown during the third quarter of the Ravens' Week 5 matchup with the Texans. </p>\n<p>Payton, who unanimously is any conversation regarding the greatest running backs in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history, scored each of those touchdowns during his 13-year career with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a>. Payton retired after the 1987 as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> all-time career rushing leader, a title he held until Emmitt Smith passed him during the 2002 season. </p><p>Earlier this season, Henry passed another legendary running back, Jim Brown, on the career rushing touchdown list. He also recently passed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> all-time rushing leader <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/492963/steven-jackson/\">Steven Jackson</a> for 18th on the career rushing list. </p>\n<p>The 31-year-old Henry is approaching another notable milestone. Barring injury, he will soon become the 17th player in NFL history to rush for 12,000 yards. That number is significant in that each eligible running back with at least 12,000 rushing yards is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. </p><p>It's safe to say that Henry's career will also be immortalized in Canton, Ohio some day. A five-time Pro Bowler, Henry is a two-time rushing champion and is one of only nine running backs in history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Henry, his score took place with the Ravens down big against the visiting Texans. Henry's score, which cut the Texans' lead to 34-10, was the lone bright spot in what was otherwise been a forgettable day for the Ravens, who are closing in on a 1-4 start to the 2025 season. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Sanchez was stabbed in the upper torso around 12:30 a.m. Saturday in downtown Indianapolis near Loughmiller's Pub & Eatery before he was transported to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. The incident escalated near a loading dock where the 69-year-old, identified as a truck driver, said he believed he was in danger and pepper sprayed Sanchez in the face. </p>\n<p>Sanchez allegedly still advanced toward the man and the man said he thought \"this guy is trying to kill me.\" That's when the man pulled his knife and stabbed Sanchez \"two or three times\" with Sanchez still coming toward him. The driver then alleged that he was thrown against a dumpster and believed he was in a life-or-death situation. The driver says a look of shock came over Sanchez before Sanchez took off.</p><p>Sanchez was upgraded to stable later in the day, according to the media outlet. Court documents suggest the 69-year-old man was acting in self defense. Police wrote in their affidavit that Sanchez told detective Christopher Edwards at the hospital that he did not remember who stabbed him.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/last-minute-best-bets-for-nfl-week-5-can-dolphins-keep-it-rolling-post-tyreek-hill-will-lions-cover/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Last minute best bets for NFL Week 5: Can Dolphins keep it rolling post-Tyreek Hill?

Game 2 isn't until Monday at 6:08 p.m. ET, but Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Sunday that an MRI showed no major tear or strain.</p><p>\"We'll know more tomorrow, but I think after the game they stretched him out,\" Thomson told reporters. \"They got him moving around a little bit, and I think he felt a lot better after that. We'll know whether he's available to start or at least to pinch-hit. We'll know more tomorrow.\"</p><p>Bader, 31, was acquired by the Phillies on trade deadline day from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a>. In his 50 games in the regular season for the Phillies, he hit .305/.361/.463 (124 OPS+) with excellent defense in center field. He posted 1.4 WAR. In two plate appearances in Game 1, he had a sacrifice fly and was hit by a pitch before being replaced in the bottom of the seventh inning. He also made a diving catch in center.</p><p>If Bader does end up missing a game or more, the Phillies could use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449449/brandon-marsh/\">Brandon Marsh</a> in center field instead of left and put <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765816/nick-castellanos/\">Nick Castellanos</a> in right field, flipping <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044504/max-kepler/\">Max Kepler</a> to left. In Game 2, the Dodgers are starting lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2006996/blake-snell/\">Blake Snell</a>, so the platoons say that Castellanos and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2803485/weston-wilson/\">Weston Wilson</a> will be in there for Marsh and Kepler, respectively. That means if Bader can't play, the Phillies will either need to play the left handed-hitting Marsh in center or put <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658258/otto-kemp/\">Otto Kemp</a> in the lineup, unless they want to throw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167505/edmundo-sosa/\">Edmundo Sosa</a> in the outfield.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, they really need Bader to be good to go for Game 2.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

After trailing by nine late in the third quarter, the Aces surged ahead in the middle of the fourth, then held on in the final minute. A'ja Wilson went for 21 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677836/dana-evans/\">Dana Evans</a> added 21 points off the bench. </p><p>Game 2 of this best-of-seven series is set for Sunday afternoon. Can the Aces take a commanding 2-0 lead? Or will the Mercury even things up?</p><p>The Aces entered the season with expectations of contending after their early playoff exit last season, but got off to a disappointing start. They were still below .500 in late July and lost by 53 points to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> on Aug. 2. That historic defeat spurred their incredible late-season turnaround, and they closed the regular season on a 16-game winning streak to earn the No. 2 seed. In the playoffs, though, the Aces have not looked so dominant. They needed all three games to defeat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Seattle Storm</a> in the first round, and all five games to get past the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> in the semifinals. </p><p>No one was sure what would happen with the Mercury this season after their complete overhaul in the winter. Franchise icons <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105071/diana-taurasi/\">Diana Taurasi</a> (retirement) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063686/brittney-griner/\">Brittney Griner</a> (free agency) departed, and only two members of their 2024 squad returned. They brought in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> to form a big three with Kahleah Copper, but had a largely untested supporting cast. Their regular-season campaign was choppy at times, in part due to injuries, but they proved they could be a real threat thanks to their top-tier talent. Likewise, their playoff run has been a roller coaster, but they've taken out the reigning champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a> and top-seeded Minnesota Lynx. </p>\n<p>This is the third Finals appearance in the last four seasons for the Aces, who are seeking their third championship in franchise history. The Mercury, meanwhile, are in the Finals for the first time since 2021, and trying to win a fourth title, which would move them into a tie with the Lynx, Seattle Storm and now-defunct Houston Comets for the most all-time. </p><p>The Aces opened as a slight favorite to win the title (-122 on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>).

Wilson has always been the driving force behind the Aces' success in recent years, but now, more than ever, they are extremely reliant on her offense. Through the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Aces are 4-1 when Wilson has at least 25 points and 1-2 when she doesn't get to that number. </p>\n<p><strong>Mercury: Alyssa Thomas<br /></strong>They call Alyssa Thomas \"The Engine\" for a reason. The 12-year vet never slows down, and has taken the Mercury to the Finals in her first season with the club. Though she once again fell short of MVP, she may lift the most important trophy for the most time in her career if she can keep playing like she has this postseason. Thomas is averaging 18.6 points, 8.4 rebounds, 9.1 assists and two steals through the first two rounds. The only other player to average at least 18/8/8 during a playoff run? Thomas in 2023. </p><h2>Three keys to the series</h2><p><strong>Can the Mercury slow down Wilson?<br /></strong>During the first two rounds of the playoffs, A'ja Wilson has scored 29.9% of the Aces' points and taken 31.2% of their field goal attempts. Her 34% usage rate leads all players (min. 25 minutes played) in the postseason by a significant margin. The next closest is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677896/kelsey-mitchell/\">Kelsey Mitchell</a> at 27.7%. </p><p>Everything the Aces do runs through Wilson. If the Mercury can find a way to slow Wilson down, they'll have a great chance to win this series. </p>\n<p>During the regular season, Wilson averaged 25 points, 15.7 rebounds and three assists against the Mercury, and though she only shot 45.1% across those three games, she got to the line for 32 free throws -- an average of more than 10 per contest. </p><p>The Mercury do not have a huge front line. The only player on their roster above 6-foot-4 is 6-foot-7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29105418/kalani-brown/\">Kalani Brown</a>, who has played three minutes in the playoffs. But what the Mercury lack in height they make up in physicality and determination. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26681399/natasha-mack/\">Natasha Mack</a>, Satou Sabally and Alyssa Thomas are all extremely tough, and the Mercury's perimeter players love to dig and swipe at the ball any time it comes near the paint. The Mercury are only allowing 20.6 attempts per game inside five feet in the playoffs, and opponents are shooting 56.9% on those looks. Among the eight playoff teams, the Mercury rank third and fourth, respectively, in those categories. </p>\n<p>There figure to be two big questions in regards to the Mercury's efforts to contain Wilson</p><ol><li>How much contact will the referees allow?</li><li>Can the Mercury keep her away from the rim and turn her into a jump shooter?</li></ol><p>Officiating has been a major talking point throughout the playoffs, and no team has been more physical than the Mercury. And yet, the Mercury have only been called for 13.9 fouls per game. No other team in the postseason is below 15 per game. If the Mercury are allowed to knock Wilson around, that will be to their benefit. But if the officials call the game tight and Wilson gets to the free throw line like she did in their regular season matchups, that's advantage Aces. For what it's worth, Wilson's 7.3 free throws per game are tied for the most of any player in the postseason. </p><p>Wilson is the most dominant offensive player in the league, and capable of beating opponents from any point on the floor. However, she's significantly more efficient around the rim than anywhere else. In the regular season, she shot 70% in the restricted area, compared to 45% in the mid-range. Similar story in the playoffs, as she's made 61.5% of her rim attempts and 41.5% of her mid-rangers. If Wilson is rampaging to the rim, the Mercury have little hope, but if they can wall up and force her to pull up for jumpers, they'll have a chance. </p>\n<p><strong>Will Nate Tibbetts adjust his starting lineup?<br /></strong>The Mercury were forced to use a number of different starting lineups during the regular season due to injuries, but their primary unit was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29684795/monique-akoa-makani/\">Monique Akoa Makani</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677851/kahleah-copper/\">Kahleah Copper</a>, Satou Sabally, Alyssa Thomas and Natasha Mack. During the regular season, that group was very good. During the playoffs, they've been a disaster. </p><p>Here's a look at the starters' splits between the regular season and postseason: </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Time</th><th>Off. Rtg.</th><th>Def. Rtg.</th><th>Net Rtg.</th></tr><tr><td><p>Regular season</p></td><td><p>99.0</p></td><td><p>88.4</p></td><td><p>+10.6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Playoffs</p></td><td><p>82.9</p></td><td><p>105.7</p></td><td><p>-22.9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Even during the regular season, this group's offense was shaky. In the playoffs, its lack of shooting has been exposed. Neither Mack nor Thomas look at the basket outside of 12-15 feet and Akoa Makani, who shot the ball well on low volume in the regular season, has really struggled in the playoffs. And even at their best, Sabally and Copper are streaky from behind the arc. </p><p>The Mercury's starters cannot score, and to make matters worse, they've been getting torched on the other end -- in part because opponents are rarely having to play against a set defense. </p><p>While the Mercury have made some incredible comebacks this postseason, that's only been necessary because their starters keep digging a hole. The Mercury have a minus-8.1 net rating in the first quarter and a minus-6.8 net rating in the third quarter during the playoffs. On the other hand, their second quarter net rating is plus-17.6 and their fourth quarter net rating is a staggering plus-23.8 -- the best of all eight postseason teams. </p><p>The Mercury's second-most used lineup this postseason behind the starters features the Big Three of Thomas, Sabally and Copper with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677803/sami-whitcomb/\">Sami Whitcomb</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1201037/dewanna-bonner/\">DeWanna Bonner</a> in place of Akoa Makani and Mack. That group has a plus-21.8 net rating over 55 minutes. </p><p>All of which begs the question, why not just start that latter group in the first place? If Tibbetts wants to keep the same starters for morale purposes, he should, at the very least, have a shorter leash. The Mercury have stole a few games in this run with miraculous fourth quarters, but they may not get so lucky in the Finals. </p><p><strong>Can the Aces force turnovers?<br /></strong>Here are a few stats through the first two rounds of the playoffs:</p><ul><li>The Mercury are first in turnover rate (15%)</li><li>The Mercury are first in opponent points off turnovers (12.1)</li><li>The Mercury are first in defensive rating (92.2)</li><li>The Aces are first in opponent turnover rate (19.2%)</li><li>The Aces are first in points off turnovers per game (19.1)</li><li>The Aces are first in percentage of points off turnovers (22%)</li><li>The Aces are first in offensive rating (108.9)</li></ul><p>In summary, the Mercury have been the best defensive team in the playoffs, in part because they take care of the ball and don't give up easy points off turnovers, while the Aces have been the best offensive team in the playoffs, in part because they force a lot of turnovers that they're able to turn into easy points. </p><p>Something will have to give in the Finals. </p><p>For what it's worth, when the two teams (who were both fully healthy at the time) met in late August, near the end of the regular season, the Aces won by 22. They forced 14 turnovers in that game, which they turned into 21 points -- nearly exactly the margin of the game. </p>\n<h2>Game 2 Prediction</h2><p>There was no clear favorite heading into this series, and the only thing most experts could agree on was that it would be a long series. Game 1 only confirmed that this matchup could go either way. The Mercury should have some extra juice on Sunday, as they will not want to fall down 2-0. However, the Aces still have the best player in the series in A'ja Wilson and Mercury star Alyssa Thomas is dealing with a hand issue. We'll again lean on the home side in what is essentially a toss-up. <strong>Pick: Aces -2.5</strong></p>\n            </div>",

meeting between reigning champions Arsenal and the record eight-time winners OL Lyonnes. It may be early in the season but this game comes at a fascinating juncture for both teams – Lyon are off to a perfect start in league play under new manager Jonatan Giraldez and after a busy summer, acquiring the likes of Lily Yohannes, Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Jule Brand in the hopes of winning their first Champions League title since 2022. Their roster is undoubtedly stacked but the true test of Lyon's mettle always comes in European competition, so Tuesday's match offers Giraldez a first chance to discover what his best starting lineup actually looks like.</p><p>As for Arsenal, the luster of their first-ever Champions League win has not exactly faded – they supplemented that triumph with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-results-psgs-ousmane-dembele-barcelonas-aitana-bonmati-take-home-awards-make-history/live/\">Women's Club of the Year awards at the Ballon d'Or ceremony</a> just two weeks ago – but this season has not been a breeze to start. They have just two wins out of five to start the Women's Super League season and are winless in their last three, troubling form ahead of a top-tier clash in Europe. The Gunners have the ability to keep things competitive on Tuesday, boasting a squad with back-to-back European champions Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly and Ballon d'Or runner-up Mariona Caldentey. Whether they put all the pieces in time for their Champions League opener, though, is a huge question.</p><p><strong>USWNT players in the UWCL:</strong> A handful of U.S. women's national team players will take part in the Champions League this season, many of them on teams with their sights set on the ultimate prize. Tuesday's marquee matchup between Arsenal and Lyon will showcase just that as the Gunners' Emily Fox faces Lyon's Lindsey Heaps and Lily Yohannes, the latter of whom could make her UWCL debut for her new club after a handful of reps at Ajax.</p><p>Alyssa Thompson, meanwhile, could make her competition debut when Chelsea travel to Twente, while USWNT teammates <span>Naomi Girma</span> and Catarina Macario could also feature. Goalkeeper <span>Phallon Tullis-Joyce</span> will likely start for Manchester United as they host Valarenga on Wednesday, while <span>Crystal Dunn</span> could feature for Paris Saint-Germain at Wolfsburg on the same day.</p>\n            </div>",

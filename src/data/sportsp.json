Star wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a> was carted off the field in the second quarter with what was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/malik-nabers-injury-update-giants-star-wr-suffered-torn-acl-against-chargers-placed-on-season-ending-ir/\" target=\"_blank\">later confirmed to be a torn ACL.</a></span></p><p>Nabers, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, was placed on season-ending injured reserve. With his absence, some other pass catchers will need to step up. One wide receiver who will likely see more playing time is 2023 third round pick <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171911/jalin-hyatt/\">Jalin Hyatt</a>. </p><p>As he approaches this new opportunity to have a bigger role on quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-darts/\">Jaxson Dart's</a> offense, Hyatt has Nabers in his corner offering encouragement.</p><p>\"We had a long talk. He's one of my best friends on this team,\" Hyatt <a href=\"https://x.com/SNYGiants/status/1973467117337940400\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"He's been in my corner, he's kind of seen the adversity I've been through. He just told me it's my chance, this is the time for me to do what I've got to do. So I'm going to be ready. I just can't wait to go out, play Sunday, play with [Dart], and get a win.\"</p>\n<p>Hyatt hasn't had any passes thrown his way this season from Dart or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a>, who began the season as the Giants' starter. The 24-year-old has played in two games, with 35 total snaps.</p><p>The Giants wide receiver room also includes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124107/wandale-robinson/\">Wan'Dale Robinson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183982/darius-slayton/\">Darius Slayton</a>, the likely starters, along with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3117210/gunner-olszewski/\">Gunner Olszewski</a> and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694592/beaux-collins/\">Beaux Collins</a>.</p><p>When asked if the other wide receivers in the room are ready for the increased snap count, coach Brian Daboll expressed confidence in them all, saying, \"they wouldn't be here if they weren't.\"</p>\n<p>\"So, we had obviously a lot of confidence in the three guys that we have. Malik goes down and we have confidence in the guys that are behind them,\" Daboll <a href=\"https://www.giants.com/news/quotes-9-29-coach-brian-daboll\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"Whether it's Beaux, whether it's Hyatt, Gunner knows multiple roles. We have some guys on the practice squad that we like. So, we'll get ready to play with the guys that we have and I'm confident in all those guys.\"</p><p>In his rookie year, Hyatt played in all 17 games, starting seven, with 23 receptions for 373 yards. Last season he played in 16 games, with three starts, finishing with eight receptions for 62 yards. He has yet to make it in the end zone in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>.</p><p>Before going down with his injury, Nabers led the team in targets (35), receiving yards (271) and receiving touchdowns (2). Last season, Nabers had the seventh-most receiving yards in the league (1,204) on 109 receptions with seven touchdowns.</p>\n            </div>"

Unfortunately for the 49ers, that's just the start of a lengthy injury list. Wide receivers Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall have also been ruled out, and tight end George Kittle remains on IR. Hopefully Christian McCaffrey has been hitting the cold tubs often this week.</li><li><strong>Three teams forced a winner-take-all Game 3 in the MLB Wild Card round.</strong> The Guardians, Padres and Yankees <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">all kept their respective seasons alive with Game 2 wins</a></span> -- some a bit more dramatic than others. That means baseball fans will get a triple-header of do-or-die action later today. The only team to finish the job Wednesday was the Dodgers, who beat the Reds to reach the NLDS.</li><li><strong>Brian Snitker has stepped down as manager of the Braves.</strong> Snitker served as the Braves' manager for seven seasons after taking over as the interim in 2016, and he led the team to six straight NL East titles and the 2021 World Series. Snitker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/braves-brian-snitker-steps-down-as-manager-veteran-skipper-won-2021-world-series-six-division-titles/\">will move into an advisory role next season</a>, his 50th with the team in one way or another. See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/ranking-mlbs-eight-managerial-openings-braves-orioles-offer-upside-rockies-avoid-being-last-on-list/\">where the Braves' managerial opening ranks</a> among the eight vacancies across the league.</li><li><strong>Former All-Pro DB Xavien Howard announced his sudden retirement.</strong> Just four games into the 2025 season, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/xavien-howard-retires-former-all-pro-selection-calls-it-a-career-after-just-four-games-with-colts/\">Howard has decided to call it a career</a>. After sitting out the 2024 season, Howard signed with the Colts back in August, and he cited his experience during that year off as a major reason for his decision. A second-round pick in 2016, Howard led the NFL in interceptions twice, was named a first-team All-Pro in 2020 and earned four Pro Bowl nods throughout his career.</li><li><strong>The Big Ten is contemplating a $2 billion private equity deal.</strong> Like it or not -- and I do not -- private equity firms are circling college athletics. The Big Ten is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-ten-contemplating-2-billion-private-equity-deal-grant-of-rights-extension-with-decision-on-horizon/\">reportedly mulling over a deal that could climb upward of $2 billion</a> and extend its grant of rights until 2046. While the thought of big(ger) money infiltrating college football makes my purist stomach churn, the silver lining is that the deal may stave off the formation of one super league for the time being.</li></ul><h2> ⚾ Do not miss this: Yankees force Game 3 vs. Red Sox </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"untitled-design-2025-10-01t224330-775.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/f1d4d215-bdd0-41a7-ba67-f1877c4c3fdc/resize/670x377/5c79bc6decf9c2b8e2d887886e79c850/untitled-design-2025-10-01t224330-775.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>After dropping Game 1 at home, the <strong>Yankees</strong> responded with a huge win over the <strong>Red Sox</strong> to force Game 3 in the Bronx on Thursday night. With New York in need of some clutch performances, <strong>Jazz Chisholm Jr.</strong> and <strong>Ben Rice</strong> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/jazz-chisholm-jr-ben-rice-help-yankees-stave-off-mlb-playoff-elimination-in-game-2-after-sitting-game-1/\" target=\"_blank\">came up big for the boys in pinstripes</a></span>. </p><p>Rice got the party started in the bottom of the first inning when he took Red Sox starter Brayan Bello deep for a two-run homer. Boston wouldn't go away, however, but Chisholm's lightning speed dealt the final blow when he scored from first base on an <strong>Austin Wells</strong>' two-out single in the bottom of the eighth. </p><p>Perhaps the most impressive part of the performances from Rice and Chisholm was that neither player got the start in Game 1. Now, as Mike Axisa writes, it will be very hard for manager <strong>Aaron Boone</strong> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/jazz-chisholm-jr-ben-rice-help-yankees-stave-off-mlb-playoff-elimination-in-game-2-after-sitting-game-1/\" target=\"_blank\">to keep either player out of the lineup tonight</a></span>. </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Axisa:</strong> \"<em>Whatever the lineup is going to be in Game 3 is whatever the lineup is going to be in Game 3. We'll find out Thursday. In Game 2 though, two players who were not trusted enough to be in the Game 1 lineup made impact plays. Rice opened the scoring with his homer and Chisholm saved a run with his glove and created a run with his legs. They gave the Yankees the shot in the arm they lacked Tuesday.\"</em></li></ul><p>On the other side, the Red Sox had a plan to end the series in two games. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/brayan-bello-falters-red-soxs-plan-falls-apart-as-yankees-force-win-or-go-home-wild-card-series-game-3/\" target=\"_blank\">It didn't work out</a></span>, and now Boston will have to navigate a tricky bullpen situation in order to take the series. </p><p>Game 3 will be another chapter in the Red Sox vs. Yankees rivalry and the sixth winner-take-all game in their storied history. The starting pitchers will be rather green with rookie <strong>Connelly Early</strong> going for the Red Sox and fellow rookie <strong>Cam Schlittler</strong> going for the Yankees. It's just the second time ever two rookies will go head-to-head in a winner-take-all playoff game. </p><h2> 🏈 Ranking (every) Browns starting QBs since 1999 </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"untitled-design-2025-10-01t231249-111.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/3b278186-7a74-4604-99be-f9098cd6929a/resize/670x377/7cc6b8016d2b8773736ea000cf3a1b83/untitled-design-2025-10-01t231249-111.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Our own Matt Zenitz reported that <strong>Browns</strong> coach <strong>Kevin Stefanski</strong> informed the team that rookie <strong>Dillon Gabriel</strong> will get the start against the <strong>Lions</strong> on Sunday. That gives Gabriel the distinction of becoming the 41st starting quarterback for Cleveland since 1999. Before that happens, Cody Benjamin <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-quarterbacks-ranked-1999-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">decided to rank the 40 that came before Gabriel</a></span>. </p>\n<p>The list of quarterbacks the Browns have started since Y2K was sweeping the nation is extensive, and to put it rather kindly, unremarkable. <strong>Bruce Gradkowski</strong>. <strong>Ty Detmer</strong>. <strong>Jake Delhomme</strong>. <strong>Kelly Holcomb</strong>. The list is a veritable who's who of, \"Remember this guy?!\" To give you an idea of just how bleak the situation has been, Joe Flacco, the quarterback who just got benched for Gabriel comes in at No. 4. </p><ul><li><strong>Benjamin:</strong> \"<em>Flacco, who was just benched in his second stint with the club, has only logged nine combined starts with the Browns. But the ex-Ravens stalwart and Super Bowl champion provided much-needed stability as a last-minute injury replacement in 2023, opening up the downfield passing game en route to a surprise playoff appearance.\"</em></li></ul><p>Given the relative strength (or lack thereof) of the AFC North, as well as Stefanski's offensive acumen, Gabriel won't have to do much to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/with-dillon-gabriel-as-the-browns-starting-qb-cleveland-has-a-case-to-be-the-afc-norths-best-team/\" target=\"_blank\">make the Browns the best team in the division</a></span>. There's some hope, Browns fans! </p><p>So, where does this move leave <strong>Shedeur Sanders</strong>, who literally <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-bench-joe-flacco-where-shedeur-sanders-stands-on-depth-chart-after-dillon-gabriels-promotion-to-qb1/\" target=\"_blank\">didn't anything to say</a></span> when asked about Gabriel getting the Week 5 start? Well, our own Jonathan Jones reports that Sanders <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-bench-joe-flacco-where-shedeur-sanders-stands-on-depth-chart-after-dillon-gabriels-promotion-to-qb1/\" target=\"_blank\">will remain the third-string quarterback</a></span> for now. </p>\n<h2> ⚽ PSG comes back to beat Barcelona </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"psg-8.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/ef990369-c30d-4dd0-a65c-fd98ee2bed8d/resize/670x377/b52566dca5ebc0e6805eb5975bb0f0e4/psg-8.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>In Wednesday's UEFA Champions League matchup, <strong>Barcelona</strong> jumped out to an early 1-0 lead before <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/barcelona-vs-paris-saint-germain-score-psg-come-back-to-win-2-1-behind-late-goncalo-ramos-goal/live/\" target=\"_blank\">came storming back for a 2-1 victory</a>. <strong>Senny Mayulu</strong> leveled the match for PSG before <strong>Goncalo Ramos</strong> broke the tie in the 90th minute. </p><p>Roughly a year ago, <strong>Bayern Munich</strong> star <strong>Harry Kane</strong> scored a meaningless goal against Barcelona in a 4-1 loss. Well, it was meaningless until Wednesday, when it helped Ramos take down Barcelona. After the match, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/how-a-harry-kane-champions-league-goal-played-a-big-role-in-goncalo-ramoss-winner-for-psg-at-barcelona/\" target=\"_blank\">Ramos said he remebered Kane's goal</a></span>, and he saw a similar opportunity himself. </p><p>\"I think a lot about beating a high line,\" Ramos said. \"For me, personally, it's my favorite place. I just went there, and we have very fast players coming from behind, and even against Barcelona, they have a video of Harry Kane, I think two years ago, and he did something like I did on the goal, and he scored.\" </p>\n<p>Through two matches in Champions League play, PSG is one of only six clubs to remain perfect a 2-0-0 with six points in its back pocket. </p><h2> 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest </h2><ul><figure><p><img alt=\"untitled-design-2025-10-01t231115-239.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/d7b5c069-8e6c-4e51-934e-bd1c6e82267f/resize/670x377/7a0efae5c62cbb8d7cb0b879b99cc552/untitled-design-2025-10-01t231115-239.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><li><strong>LeBron James</strong> is nursing a glute injury, but plans to have a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-sidelined-to-start-training-camp-lakers-plan-longer-ramp-up-for-star-amid-glute-injury/\" target=\"_blank\">\"longer ramp up\"</a></span> to the season while still being ready for the Lakers opener on Oct. 21.</li><li>The <strong>Cardinals</strong> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/trey-benson-injury-cardinals-rb-knee-lands-on-ir-after-stepping-in-for-james-conner-foot-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">have placed RB</a></span> <strong>Trey Benson</strong> on IR.</li><li>Oh, and <strong>Buccaneers</strong> RB <strong>Bucky Irving</strong> is <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bucky-irving-injury-buccaneers-running-back-on-crutches-with-walking-boot-after-foot-sprain/\" target=\"_blank\">on crutches and in a walking boot</a></span>.</li><li>On a related noted, if your fantasy football team is in shambles, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-week-5-start-em-sit-em-justin-fields-leads-the-way-plus-sleepers-at-every-position/\" target=\"_blank\">check out our Week 5 Start 'Em & Sit 'Em</a></span>.</li><li>Is <strong>Saquon Barkley </strong>running out of gas?

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>October is here, which means that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff race is really starting to heat up. We're just over a month from the first rankings reveal of the season and most schools are getting into the heart of conference play. </p><p>That means Week 6 will not be short on impactful matchups at the national and conference level. While Week 5's slate was packed with enticing ranked matchups, the sixth week of the year sees some top 25 teams hit the road for tough tests against unranked opponents. Especially in the Big 12. No. 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a> has to travel to face an improved <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a> squad, while No. 11 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> will look to keep rolling at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a>, which remains undefeated on the year. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> may be reeling, but it will have a chance to reverse its fortune -- at least a bit -- when it welcomes No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The SEC is also home to perhaps this weekend's most interesting ranked matchup between No. 16 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> and No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>. </p><p>Here's a look at the Week 6 games that matter in the playoff race, and what it means for both teams involved. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-rankings-oregon-rises-to-no-2-as-ole-miss-indiana-join-top-five-in-cbs-sports-136/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College football rankings: Oregon rises to No. 2 as Ole Miss, Indiana join top five in CBS Sports 136</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chip Patterson                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College football rankings: Oregon rises to No. 2 as Ole Miss, Indiana join top five in CBS Sports 136\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/29/77cf1f70-bdf5-4384-9966-fbeae905436c/thumbnail/270x152/447053f4c9022ac85398b8a55bbcb0fe/oregon-136.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>No. 14 Iowa State at Cincinnati </h2>\n<p>Iowa State has handled its two Big 12 tests with (relative) ease thus far. The Cyclones looked especially imposing on the road against a solid <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZ/arizona-wildcats/\">Arizona</a> team last week. The light finally came on for coveted wide receiver addition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28899273/chase-sowell/\">Chase Sowell</a>, who had four catches for 146 yards against the Wildcats. If Iowa State can get him going as a big-play threat, that changes the dynamic of their offense. College football fans understand that any loss in the Big 12 is devastating to a team's postseason outlook at both the conference and national levels. There typically isn't a wide gap between the top teams and the bottom tier, so every win matters. All that to say, Iowa State can't overlook anyone, especially on the road. </p><p>Cincinnati has, somewhat quietly, had a solid start to its third year under coach Scott Satterfield. Its only loss came by three points against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a> and it opened Big 12 play with a thrilling win against a good <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KANSAS/kansas-jayhawks/\">Kansas</a> team. The Bearcats are far away from being legitimate playoff competitors, but a win against an undefeated top-15 team would definitely get them closer to that conversation. </p><h2>No. 9 Texas at Florida</h2>\n<p>Texas opened the year as the top team in the country and yet it has almost steadily slipped in the AP Top 25 poll over the last several weeks in spite of the fact that its lone loss came on the road against an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> team that supplanted it for the No. 1 spot. That's because the Longhorns really haven't looked all that impressive in the games since -- especially on offense, where quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a> is performing well below expectations. The expectation is that Texas should defeat this sliding Florida team handily. SEC road games are always perilous, though, and Florida did enter the year as a top-15 team before all of its hopes spiraled down the drain.</p>\n<p>Florida is effectively out of the College Football Playoff race at this point. The Gators have a chance to play spoiler, at least. </p><h2>No. 16 Vanderbilt at No. 10 Alabama </h2>\n<p>Vanderbilt is for real. Unlike last season, when the unassuming Commodores shocked the top-ranked Crimson Tide, Alabama knows what to expect from Vanderbilt: a high-flying offensive attack led by bold quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a> and a defense that, at its best, can keep a game under control. Vanderbilt's remaining schedule is also brutal. Alabama represents the first of four straight ranked opponents for Vandy. The 'Dores will need to go at least 2-2 in that span to stay in the race. </p><p>Apparently that season-opening loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> gave Alabama the kick in the pants it needed to look like its old self. The Crimson Tide are 3-0 since and are coming off yet another win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>. This is somewhat familiar territory. Alabama beat Georgia last season, ascended to No. 1 in the AP poll and then immediately lost to unranked Vanderbilt a week later. While a loss to Vanderbilt this year would be less disastrous, it would still put Alabama in that dangerous two-loss territory. </p>\n<h2>No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> at No. 18 Florida State </h2>\n<p>It's hard to find any faults with Miami thus far. Transfer quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163129/carson-beck/\">Carson Beck</a> has maintained a high level of offensive production. The Hurricanes have two of the best trench players in football in offensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121984/francis-mauigoa/\">Francis Mauigoa</a> and edge rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125808/rueben-bain-jr/\">Rueben Bain Jr.</a>, who should have a firm spot in any Heisman Trophy talks. Mario Cristobal has a proclivity for fumbling bags, though, like when Miami lost two of its last three games last season to get knocked out of any meaningful postseason appearances. We'll see if he's grown in that area this Saturday, as the door is wide open for Miami to walk to an ACC title. </p><p>Florida State came back down to earth in Week 5 in its overtime loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a>. The ACC looks more like a one-bid league with each passing week as it continues to cannibalize itself. The Seminoles are still in the thick of contention for the championship game and, if they beat Miami, they'll be right back up there in the playoff race as well. </p><h2>Dark Horse Game of the Week </h2><h3>No. 11 Texas Tech at Houston </h3>\n<p>Texas Tech has looked every bit of a Big 12 favorite thus far. Its dominant 34-10 road win against a previously ranked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a> team cemented the fact that the Red Raiders are more than just a product of the annual offseason hype machine. That robust transfer class is proving its worth, especially along the defensive line of scrimmage. Tech also doesn't have a schedule that really lends itself to any major slipups, so every week is crucial. </p>\n<p>Houston is one of just two undefeated teams that didn't receive a single vote in the latest AP poll. The Cougars certainly don't have the best resume so far. They needed overtime to beat a winless <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREGST/oregon-state-beavers/\">Oregon State</a> squad and they've spent most of the early schedule beating up on overmatched teams. Texas Tech will be a fascinating litmus test for the progress that Houston has made under coach Willie Fritz. The Cougars will be undeniable if they emerge victorious. </p><p><em>SportsLine's proven computer model has simulated every Week 6 college football game 10,000 times. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-6-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09302025_lk_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_CFBWeek6\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see all the picks</a>, all from the model that is 34-22 since the beginning of last season on top-rated money-line and over/under picks. </em></p>\n            </div>"

Plenty of teams have already announced themselves as high-octane contenders, from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> in the AFC to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> in the NFC. Others have been scrappier than special to stay relevant, like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> atop the AFC North and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> in the NFC South.</p><p>Almost every team, however, has reason to anticipate this year's in-season trade deadline. Some clubs are primed to explore last-minute upgrades at premium positions, stocking up in hopes of a title push. Others are more equipped to consider selling big-name talent in the name of longer-term rebuilding.</p><p>So which teams should be under the microscope in the coming weeks for potential activity? Which veteran players could be available? And when, exactly, is the 2025 trade deadline? We've got you covered with all the pertinent information as all 32 teams weigh their options:</p>\n<h2>What is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> trade deadline?</h2><p>It's the <strong>designated cutoff for any trades</strong> between teams until the official start of the 2026 offseason (March 11). After the deadline, players can only be added via free agency, waivers or practice-squad signings.</p><h2>When is the deadline?</h2><p>The deadline is <strong>4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 4</strong>, which is between Weeks 9 and 10 on the regular-season schedule.</p>\n<h2>Do deadline deals actually happen?</h2><p><strong>Absolutely! </strong>It's not quite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a>- or MLB-level activity, but the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> has seen an uptick in big-name movement over the last decade or so, arguably due to both delayed deadline dates and an influx of aggressive general managers. Here are some of the most notable examples of deadline trades to go down in recent years:</p><ul><li><strong>2024: </strong>CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139278/marshon-lattimore/\">Marshon Lattimore</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a>)</li><li><strong>2023: </strong>DE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2141772/montez-sweat/\">Montez Sweat</a> (Commanders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a>)</li><li><strong>2022: </strong>RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136743/christian-mccaffrey/\">Christian McCaffrey</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>)</li><li><strong>2022: </strong>TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251097/t-j-hockenson/\">T.J.

But other injury-bitten teams might be more desperate to make a real offer now. Cousins is 37, but he's loaded with experience (159 career starts) as a traditional pocket passer. </li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a>: </strong>Increasingly sluggish since his MVP-esque days with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a>, Wilson insisted he's not focused on relocating after a justified demotion in favor of rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a>. Still, he might be appealing as a last-gasp rental somewhere else, even as his mobility and deep-ball prowess fade.</li><li><strong>Saints RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2082721/alvin-kamara/\">Alvin Kamara</a>: </strong>New Orleans just signed Kamara to a new deal last October, but the Saints aren't even close to contending under new coach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1274372/kellen-moore/\">Kellen Moore</a>. The five-time Pro Bowler might prefer putting his multipurpose skills to use for a playoff hopeful. He might be reasonably affordable at age 30, too.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a>: </strong>New coach Aaron Glenn declined to entertain a potential Hall trade prior to the start of the season, advocating for a deep backfield. But the Jets are winless, and Hall isn't breaking loose like he once did. As a pending free agent, he might suddenly be of more value to his own rebuilding team as a trade chip.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183835/jakobi-meyers/\">Jakobi Meyers</a>: </strong>He's Las Vegas' leading receiver, and it's not surprising, given his route-running polish. But the Raiders don't appear equipped for a real run this year, and Meyers previously sought a trade over failed contract discussions. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121848/tre-tucker/\">Tre Tucker</a> also emerging out wide, now might be time for a split.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136474/david-njoku/\">David Njoku</a>: </strong>Cleveland remains in transition, as per usual, and Njoku, who once thrived as an outlet for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a>, is off to a quiet start in 2025, the last year on his current contract. Meanwhile, rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28900882/harold-fannin-jr/\">Harold Fannin Jr</a>. has emerged at the same position, potentially making the veteran expendable.</li><li><strong>Dolphins OLB Bradley Chubb: </strong>Three years after landing him in a deadline deal, the Dolphins could soon make a hard decision on the ex-Denver Broncos star's future. While he logged three sacks in Miami's first four games, he's awfully expensive after 2025, when fellow rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2806235/jaelan-phillips/\">Jaelan Phillips</a> is set to become a free agent.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252834/trevon-diggs/\">Trevon Diggs</a>: </strong>We're not so sure Jerry Jones is ready to part with yet another splashy defender in the wake of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967590/micah-parsons/\">Micah Parsons</a> breakup, but Diggs is now in and out of the starting lineup as part of Dallas' porous secondary, and dealing him would clear tens of millions off the Cowboys' books from 2025-2028.</li><li><strong>Browns CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966771/greg-newsome-ii/\">Greg Newsome II</a>: </strong>Cleveland boasts one of the NFL's stingiest defenses, and Newsome is a part of that, logging two pass breakups and two tackles for loss in the Browns' first four. Still, he's due to hit free agency after the season, and the Browns could arguably still use as much draft capital as they can get.</li></ul><h2>Which teams are likely buyers and sellers?</h2><h3>Potential buyers</h3><ul><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>: </strong>No team enjoyed a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/are-the-colts-a-mirage-or-can-their-magical-2025-run-continue-forecasting-daniel-jones-next-steps-in-indy/\" target=\"_blank\">more magical start</a></span> to the 2025 season than Indianapolis, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> flaunting a new level of composure under center. The AFC South might still be theirs for the taking.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>: </strong>Things were ugly out of the gate as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> overcompensated for a lack of healthy, reliable weapons. But fresh off a decisive AFC win, they look primed to storm back into relevance.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>: </strong>They've already made a flurry of trades this year, and their roster lacks glaring holes, but since when has that stopped general manager Howie Roseman from working the phones?</li><li><strong>Seattle Seahawks: </strong>With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/sam-darnold-is-back-for-the-second-straight-year-the-seahawks-qb-looks-like-the-right-bet-for-a-new-team/\" target=\"_blank\">thriving as the new gunslinger</a></span> and Mike Macdonald still directing a physical defense, they might be the clear favorites to survive a crowded NFC West race.</li><li><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> is <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/baker-mayfields-redemption-how-the-fiery-buccaneers-qb-revived-his-nfl-career-in-tampa-bay/\" target=\"_blank\">scrapping it out as usual</a></span>, but he could use reinforcements up front and out wide, where the reigning NFC South champions are pretty significantly banged up.</li></ul><h3>Potential sellers</h3><ul><li><strong>Cleveland Browns: </strong>Frankly, they're an evergreen inclusion here. Kevin Stefanski may be coaching to win now, but the personnel just isn't in place for a true push. They figure to be focused on restocking (again).</li><li><strong>New Orleans Saints: </strong>Historically, the Saints have refused to rebuild with a passion. But the pivot to new leadership this offseason, coupled with last year's deadline activity, suggests we're finally in overhaul mode.</li><li><strong>New York Jets: </strong>Starting 0-4 under Aaron Glenn isn't necessarily a surprise, but it's clear this group is in dire need of reinforcements. They'd be wise to stockpile future picks for a bigger-picture replenishing next offseason.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a>: </strong>They tried to outfit new quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> with a veteran-laden lineup, but nothing's working under Brian Callahan's direction.

He sure looked like a former five-star recruit in silencing those concerns. Offensive coordinator Will Stein has been masterful all year at putting Moore in positions to be successful, and Moore himself capitalized once again with his fourth three-touchdown effort of the season en route to an overtime victory that silenced the White Out crowd in Happy Valley.</p><p>At +600, Moore now has the shortest Heisman odds of any candidate since the preseason. That is warranted praise. The Ducks boast arguably the best win of any team, Moore was fantastic in that victory and the season-long sample size leaves nothing left to be desired. Oregon's relatively manageable schedule ahead should also help its quarterback remain a statistical darling.</p><p>They remain behind Moore, but a couple of SEC quarterbacks actually made bigger leaps up the odds board than the new frontrunner. Simpson went on the road like his Oregon counterpart and was outstanding against Georgia with three total touchdowns, and he remains interception-free on the year with a sparkling 11-0 ratio in scoring passes to turnovers. And at Ole Miss, Chambliss finished just shy of 400 total yards against an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> defense that is easily one of the top units in the sport.</p>\n<p>Chambliss has been an absolute revelation for the Rebels and has yet to post fewer than 307 passing yards or 62 rushing yards in a game since replacing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29159005/austin-simmons/\">Austin Simmons</a> as the starter.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"Alabama v Georgia\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/772424d9-5782-4312-b8c1-0e6a3c3adb0f/resize/670x377/d67f030524b1c482942999388f4cdb63/ty-simpson.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>Alabama QB Ty Simpson led the Crimson Tide to a big win at Georgia in Week 5. </span><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Stock down: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> misses opportunity; Tommy Castellanos upset</h2><p>Drew Allar simply cannot shake the narrative that has plagued him throughout his career. Oregon was the latest top-10 team to give Penn State and its quarterback trouble. Allar had a chance to prove that his slow start to the year was a product of the Nittany Lions holding things back until conference play, but he looked like the same version of himself that completed fewer than 60% of his throws against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FIU/fiu-panthers/\">FIU</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NOVA/villanova-wildcats/\">Villanova</a>.</p><p>It simply has not been the breakout season the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> world hoped to see from Allar. The raw talent will always be there, but for whatever reason, it becomes clearer by the year that Allar just does not have a Heisman gear to kick into against top competition.</p>\n<p>In contrast, passing efficiency is no issue for Tommy Castellanos, who even after a loss still leads the nation in yards per attempt and yards per completion. The dynamic Florida State signal-caller took a major tumble in the award race, though, when his two interceptions contributed to an unforeseen double-overtime loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a>. Fortunately for Castellanos, though, he does not have to wait long for a chance to get back into favor with Heisman voters. Miami awaits this week to give him the biggest stage on the Week 6 slate.</p><h2>Longshot of the week: RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29336062/ahmad-hardy/\">Ahmad Hardy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a> (+3000)</h2><p>Ahmad Hardy may not be a Heisman Trophy longshot much longer, so now (and through Missouri's bye week) might be the last chance to find value in jumping on his bandwagon. That's because his next outing comes against Alabama, a prime spot to become a household name with another one of his monster rushing efforts.</p><p>Last year brought running backs back under the spotlight because Ashton Jeanty went wild. Hardy's numbers are not quite as gaudy, but to rush for at least 100 yards and a touchdown in each of the season's first five games is a tremendous first step towards sending a ballcarrier to the Heisman ceremony for the second time in as many years. Hardy leads the SEC in carries (103) and paces the nation in yards (730) and touchdowns (nine). If he keeps this up in conference play, he will be deservedly recognized as one of the best players in the sport.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-ole-miss-trinidad-chambliss-vanderbilts-diego-pavia-on-the-rise/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College Football QB Power Rankings: Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss, Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia on the rise</p>\n                <p>\n                    David Cobb                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College Football QB Power Rankings: Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss, Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia on the rise\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/30/0bfacf0b-d7ba-462c-8dd5-cdefb2161729/thumbnail/270x152/58ffa11a89044069745967c96c1a8628/pavia-qb-power-rankings-copy.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Week 6 performances to watch</h2><p>This week's slate is lighter than that of a monumental Week 5, but even with a handful of top teams on byes and fewer ranked matchups on the schedule, a couple of head-to-head matchups between Heisman hopefuls bring major implications to the table.</p><h3>Carson Beck vs. Tommy Castellanos</h3><p>All eyes will be on the Sunshine State in Week 6 when Florida State and Miami jockey for position in the ACC pecking order. Conference title and Heisman implications are aplenty in the game of the week. Beck is one of the best pure passers in college football. Castellanos might be the nation's best dual-threat quarterback. And the latter has to rebound after an upset loss, or else his season and Florida State's will enter the danger zone.</p><h3>Diego Pavia vs. Ty Simpson</h3><p>Don't look now, but Vanderbilt might be a College Football Playoff contender. Diego Pavia is mostly to thank for the Commodores' rise over the last two seasons, and he has a chance this week to go 2-0 against Alabama and keep an undefeated campaign alive at the midway point. All of the sudden, Pavia has the eighth-best odds to win the Heisman, but if you've been watching him all year, it should not come as a surprise. Simpson stands on the other sideline as another one of the hottest quarterbacks in the nation and could both bolster his resume with another top-25 win and halt Vanderbilt's climb.</p>\n            </div>"

North Carolina just isn't living up to the Bill Belichick hype at 2-2 and having been outscored 82-23 against Power Four competition. Clemson, for its part, went from preseason national title contender to a disastrous 1-3. Still, Clemson isn't a bad team. North Carolina might be. The Tigers win the lines of scrimmage and finally look more like themselves coming out of a bye week. -- <em>Clemson 38, North Carolina 20.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Clemson -13.5)</strong>: Is Clemson capable of covering any spread the remainder of the season as a favorite? I have questions. Which one of these teams will be be better prepared coming off a bye week? And for the Tigers, how much do they still care with end-of-season goals essentially over? These are all factors to consider when making this play. There's the obvious talent discrepancy as well, but that hasn't helped Dabo Swinney's much through four games. -- <em>Clemson 27, North Carolina 10.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BOISE/boise-state-broncos/\">Boise State</a> at No. 21 Notre Dame</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Notre Dame -17.5)</strong>: This line is climbing the wrong direction for Boise State midway through this week. But it should be noted that Brad and I pick the lines as of Sunday. Thus, the value is with Notre Dame. Boise State is good. The Broncos are strong defensively, particularly in the secondary, and they're going to be a tough test. But Notre Dame's scored on everyone this year, and I'm hesitant to bet on a Boise State offense that's a middling 61st in offensive success rate. If there's an area of vulnerability for Notre Dame it's in the secondary, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28921239/maddux-madsen/\">Maddux Madsen</a> has just been OK (69th in QBR) and I haven't seen enough from the Broncos to think they'll light it up through the air. Give me the Irish to cover. -- <em>Notre Dame 35, Boise State 17.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Boise State +17.5)</strong>: The Irish might be overvalued a bit here after just hanging 50-plus at Arkansas, but they're certainly a team that looks to be hitting their stride since opening with losses to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. And while improved, there are still areas of weakness to sort out defensively at Notre Dame before mentioning \"playoff\" and \"Irish\" in the same sentence moving forward. I'll take the underdogs to cover here. -- <em>Notre Dame 38, Boise State 23.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Michigan State +11.5)</strong>: This could be a big day for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392540/dylan-raiola/\">Dylan Raiola</a> and the Huskers passing attack, because the Spartans have been horrendous this year defending the pass at 116th in success rate and 117th nationally in passing yards allowed per game. The question becomes can Michigan State's offense score enough against what is an excellent Nebraska secondary to keep up? I think Michigan State does enough coming out of a bye to keep this close. -- <em>Nebraska 34, Michigan State 24.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Michigan State +11.5)</strong>: Any believers in Nebraska yet? The home loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> was a missed opportunity for Matt Rhule, who still hasn't beaten a nationally-ranked opponent with Huskers. The Spartans aren't ranked, but they did cover at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a> this month and have an offense capable of keeping it within the number. If Nebraska leaves the back door open, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897339/aidan-chiles/\">Aidan Chiles</a> will deliver with a touchdown pass to cash. -- <em>Nebraska 31, Michigan State 24.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Cincinnati -1.5)</strong>: The Bearcats are much better this year, but I'm still a little surprised to see them favored over a ranked Iowa State team. But Vegas doesn't care about records or rankings, and the Bearcats have been playing great. To me this game comes down to one area: How does Cincinnati's pass defense holds up? I have full confidence the Bearcats can score. That unit's been awesome at third nationally in yards per play. But the Cincinnati secondary has been a disaster at 132nd nationally in defensive success rate against the pass. Can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877490/rocco-becht/\">Rocco Becht</a> take advantage? I'm not sure. High-scoring, high-volume games aren't how Iowa State usually wins. Give me the Bearcats. -- <em>Cincinnati 27, Iowa State 24.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Cincinnati -1.5)</strong>: If you're keeping tabs on games featuring an unranked team being favored at home against a ranked opponent, it hits more often than not. We saw it happen last week when then-unbeaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a> was an underdog at Arizona State. Another scenario could be unfolding here in the unpredictable Big 12. Iowa State's unbeaten, but this will be its first road game against a conference opponent this fall. -- <em>Cincinnati 23, Iowa State 20.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> at No. 6 Texas A&M</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Mississippi State +13.5)</strong>: Unlike Auburn over the weekend, Mississippi State is capable enough on offense to stress a Texas A&M defense that's had some shaky moments early this year. It also helps that quietly the Bulldogs' defense has been excellent at 32nd nationally in yards allowed per play. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168291/blake-shapen/\">Blake Shapen</a> needs to recapture some of his early-season form, but I think this sets up well for a Mississippi State cover. I wouldn't even rule out an upset if the Bulldogs can force a few turnovers. -- <em>Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 21.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Mississippi State +13.5)</strong>: Mississippi State is 5-0 ATS this season and could've beaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> outright last week as a 7.5-point underdog at home before the Vols forced overtime. Texas A&M failed to cover at home against Auburn and needed its top defensive performance of the season to down the Tigers. The Aggies should stay unbeaten, but take the points here. And if you can get 14 points or more by kickoff, even better. -- <em>Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 24.</em></p><h2>No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Texas -7.5)</strong>: This is a tough game for Florida. Unless we see a very different offensive product from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> and the Gators passing attack, Florida will really struggle against one of the elite defenses in college football. And while the Gators defense has held up admirably for much of the year, the injuries are starting to pile up for that unit, especially along the defensive line. Maybe Florida comes out of the bye week and looks totally different. It's possible. But based on what we've seen so far, I'll take Texas to cover. -- <em>Texas 27, Florida 17.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Texas -7.5)</strong>: Statement coming from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a>? His first SEC start of the season is the most important on this Texas schedule. It's difficult to imagine the Longhorns being a factor in the league title race or playoff conversation if they fall to a team amid a significant decline. Billy Napier's offense has no rhythm and going up against a defense littered with stars, that's a bad omen. -- <em>Texas 24, Florida 10.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 11 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Texas Tech -10.5)</strong>: I enter this game wondering if Houston can score enough to keep up with Texas Tech. The Cougars are better on that side of the ball but still rank just 86th nationally in yards per play and 116th in offensive success rate. That could be a problem against what's been an elite Texas Tech defense and an offensive unit capable of putting up points in bunches. Houston's defense keeps this game close for a while, but Texas Tech is going to be tough to beat coming out of a bye week. -- <em>Texas Tech 28, Houston 17.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Houston +10.5)</strong>: We're keeping the Red Raiders as the projected Big 12 champion this week, but Joey McGuire's team is marked and is no more upset proof than many other remaining unbeatens. Unlike most Texas Tech wins, this one could take more of the methodical approach against an opponent whose front seven defensively may struggle getting push. But if you're giving me 10.5 points with an unranked team at home coached by Willie Fritz, I'm taking it. -- <em>Texas Tech 31, Houston 23.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> at No. 20 Michigan</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Wisconsin +16.5)</strong>: Does Wisconsin look any better coming out of the bye week? That's the big question entering this one. It helps the Badgers' case that Billy Edwards is back under center as QB1. But the Badgers still must figure out a way to consistently run the football. Michigan, outside of big runs by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123679/justice-haynes/\">Justice Haynes</a>, isn't usually particularly explosive offensively, so that works in Wisconsin's favor in terms of keeping this close. Michigan is better, but the Badgers manage to cover in an important game for Luke Fickell. -- <em>Michigan 31, Wisconsin 20. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Michigan -16.5)</strong>: It's show me time for Fickell and the Badgers. Too often Wisconsin has come out flat under this current regime in big games, so here's a chance at reversing those fortunes in Ann Arbor. The best play here would be taking the under, but if you must pick a side, Michigan with a late cover in a potentially ugly game feels like the right spot to put your money. -- <em>Michigan 30, Wisconsin 13.</em></p><h2>No. 16 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> at No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Vanderbilt +13.5)</strong>: Vanderbilt is a product with which I know exactly what to expect. The Commodores are going to control the clock, efficiently move the football and avoid defensive mistakes that lead to explosive plays. Alabama? The Crimson Tide are more talented, but we've seen some very uneven performances from them this year. This game comes down to two areas to me: 1. How does a just OK Vanderbilt offensive line hold up? 2. Can Alabama establish any sort of run game and avoid making <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> carry the offense? I do think Alabama gets revenge at home. But Vanderbilt is going to make it difficult. -- <em>Alabama 34, Vanderbilt 27.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Vanderbilt +13.5)</strong>: Vanderbilt's not going to beat Alabama for a second straight year, but this line feels disrespectful to the Commodores. Knowing what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a> was able to do against this defense last season should worry Alabama fans, especially since he's red-hot again through five games. Vanderbilt's been beating the opposition by more than four touchdowns per game this fall, but that changes this weekend. -- <em>Alabama 38, Vanderbilt 27.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 3 Miami at No. 18 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Miami -5.5)</strong>: This is going to be a fun test for Miami's revamped defense. It takes so much discipline to play Florida State's offense led by Gus Malzahn and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875815/tommy-castellanos/\">Tommy Castellanos</a>, and the Hurricanes have historically (and at times this year) had issues with busts and tackling. At the same time, I'm not particularly optimistic about Florida State's defense generating much pressure against what is the best O-line in college football. Both these teams are good. But Miami has the better roster and has the advantage of coming off a bye. Give me the Hurricanes. -- <em>Miami 35, Florida State 28.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Miami -5.5)</strong>: I was admittedly surprised Virginia had as much success offensively as it did against the Seminoles, which resulted in an inexcusable road loss for Mike Norvell despite a sizable talent advantage. Here, it is Miami's turn to flex its roster after an open date. Can Florida State block this Hurricanes' front? That's where the game will be won. Pressuring Castellanos is key for the unbeaten Hurricanes. -- <em>Miami 27, Florida State 20.</em></p>\n            </div>"

Minnesota has the second-highest pressure rate in the NFL entering Week 5 and is tied for the fifth-most sacks in the league. Even with the Browns defense likely giving the Vikings offense fits, I don't think Gabriel will be able to keep this within the number. </p><p><strong>Projected score</strong>: Vikings 23, Browns 17<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Vikings -4.5</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Sunday, 4:25 p.m. (Fox | </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fubo</strong></a><strong>, try for free)</strong></li></ul><p>The Bengals are lost offensively.

They commit silly penalties, can't block and have no semblance of a consistent running game. </p>\n<p>And that unit is supposed to keep this close with the Lions, who lead the NFL with 34.3 points per game this season? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968514/aidan-hutchinson/\">Aidan Hutchinson</a> should have a field day attacking this offensive line, and the Lions offense should continue to hum against a defense that just allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nix/\">Bo Nix</a> to light them up for three total touchdowns Monday night.</p><p>Since the start of last season, the Lions have covered in 75% of their games, which is tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> for the best cover percentage in the NFL.

Conversely, the Rams are relatively healthy coming into Week 5, and look like the more polished team. Under center, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> ranks top five in the NFL this season in yards per attempt (8.2), passing yards (1,114), and passing touchdowns (eight). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> has been his go-to target, as the Rams wideout went bonkers over the first month and currently leads the NFL in receiving yards. </p>\n<p>As for the defense, they've been able to get after the quarterback, tallying 14 sacks, which is tied for the second-most in the league. Sure, Kyle Shanahan has a winning record (10-7) against Sean McVay in their coaching careers, but the Rams head coach is currently riding a three-game win streak against him. L.A. has also been very favorable to bettors when facing divisional opponents, owning a 10-3-1 ATS record against the NFC West over the past 14 contests. </p><p><strong>Projected score</strong>: Rams 28, 49ers 20<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Rams -7.5</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fubo</strong></a><strong>, try for free)</strong></li></ul><p>The Dolphins offense took a major hit with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/\">Tyreek Hill</a> suffering a devastating knee injury that ends his season. While that lowers their ceiling for the rest of the season, they should be fine in this matchup against the Panthers, who are averaging just 18.8 points per game through the first month.</p><p>The Dolphins defense doesn't exactly instill the most confidence, but I'm not sure Carolina can adequately exploit their deficiencies. Carolina doesn't possess much of a threat in terms of rushing the passer, either (just two sacks through four games), so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741209/tua-tagovailoa/\">Tua Tagovailoa</a> should have a relatively clean pocket to work through.</p>\n<p>Beyond the passing attack, I view this as a smash spot for Dolphins running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171161/devon-achane/\">De'Von Achane</a>, who will face a Panthers run defense surrendering 4.9 yards per carry (fourth-highest in the NFL).

Baltimore's defense was in shambles heading into that matchup, and K.C. will now face a much tougher unit in the Jaguars, who have recorded a league-leading 13 takeaways so far this season. Jacksonville is also allowing just 18.0 points per game, which is top-five in the NFL. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Jags offense is still finding its way -- especially through the air with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3132164/brian-thomas-jr/\">Brian Thomas Jr</a>. and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> not exactly lighting it up after four weeks -- but it can run the ball. Jacksonville is third in the NFL in rushing yards per game, which is where it could exploit a poor Chiefs run defense (127.0 yards per game allowed). </p>\n<p>The Jaguars' defense and rushing attack will keep them around in this game, so I'll gladly take the field goal plus the hook. </p><p><strong>Projected score</strong>: Chiefs 24, Jaguars 21<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Jaguars +3.5</p><p><strong>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a>, where you can <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport&sid=430f96e1-345d-45ff-b9e3-c6827241581f--0273\" target=\"_blank\">get up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first football wager loses</a>.</strong></p><h3>Rest of the bunch</h3><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a></strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Colts 28, Raiders 20<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Colts -6.5</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a></strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Saints 23, Giants 20<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Saints -1.5</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a></strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Cowboys 30, Jets 23<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Cowboys -2.5</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a></strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Eagles 27, Broncos 21<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Eagles -3.5</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> at Ravens</strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Texans 24, Ravens 20<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Texans -1.5</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a></strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Cardinals 28, Titans 17<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Cardinals -7.5</p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a></strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Seahawks 24, Buccaneers 23<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Buccaneers +3.5</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> at Chargers</strong><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Chargers 27, Commanders 23<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Chargers -2.5</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a><br /><strong>Projected score</strong>: Bills 33, Patriots 21<br /><strong>The pick</strong>: Bills -8.5</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>An NFC West rivalry will kick off Week 5 of the NFL season as the Los Angeles Rams host the San Francisco 49ers for Thursday Night Football. This game will feature two great running backs, with Kyren Williams and Christian McCaffrey looking like two of the league's true bellcow ball carriers through the first month of the season. Williams is listed as high as -185 in the latest NFL anytime touchdown scorer odds, while you can find McCaffrey to score a TD for as high as -120. Both players are expected to receive heavy workloads on Thursday, with McCaffrey's over/under for rushing yards set at 64.5 and Williams' set at 67.5.

That includes five touchdowns in three career games against the 49ers and three touchdowns against San Francisco in SoFi Stadium last season. He's scored in 23 of his last 32 regular-season games, and <strong>the model predicts that he scores 0.93 touchdowns on average, while his implied touchdown probability is 64.9%.</strong></p><h2>Davante Adams, Rams (+115, DraftKings)</h2><p>At 32, Adams is coming off his sixth 1,000-yard season in seven years and is still incredibly productive in general. Now he slots in as the No. 2 receiver in Los Angeles behind Puka Nacua, and it's looked like an ideal fit in the first four games. Despite being questionable for the game with a hamstring injury, Adams scored for a third consecutive week in a win over the Colts on Sunday, and he has a staggering 47.1% red-zone target share thus far. <strong>The model predicts he scores 0.63 touchdowns on average, while his odds imply a 46.5% chance of scoring</strong>.</p><h2>Marquez Valdes-Scantling (+1300, FanDuel)</h2><p>The veteran has only suited up three times for the 49ers, and he's only been targeted twice, but he's been capable of catching lightning in a bottle throughout his career with the Packers, Chiefs, Bills and Saints. He's scored 20 times in his career, and 11 of those scores have been for 40 yards or more. Jauan Jennings (ankle) and Ricky Pearsall (knee) were both DNPs early in the week, and their snaps will likely be limited to some extent on a short week if they're able to play at all. <strong>The model predicts Valdes-Scantling scores 0.14 touchdowns on average, while his implied scoring probability is 7.1%</strong>.

Now they'll host this elimination game and the pitching matchup will be Slade Cecconi vs. Jack Flaherty. That's a slight advantage to Cleveland, with Cecconi sporting a 4.30 ERA on the season and posting a 2.25 ERA in two starts against the Tigers while Flaherty had a 4.64 ERA on the season and a 3.94 ERA in three starts against the Guardians. <strong>Cleveland covers on the run line in 71% of simulations</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Chicago Cubs vs. San Diego Padres (Thursday, 5:08 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Cubs money line (-120)</strong></li></ul><p>Former Cub Yu Darvish will take the mound for San Diego on Thursday and it's been a tough season for the five-time all-star. Darvish was only able to make 15 starts and posted a 5.38 ERA. Meanwhile, the Cubs will counter with Jameson Taillon, who also battled injuries but still managed a 3.68 ERA over 23 starts. A later start today than the previous two games should also mean a slightly more riled up crowd at Wrigley Field. <strong>The model has Chicago winning in 59% of simulations</strong>.</p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">Top player prop</a>: Riley Greene, Tigers, Over 0.5 total bases (-1169) (MODEL)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">Top player prop</a>: Elly De La Cruz, Reds, Over 0.5 total bases (-139) (MODEL)</li></ul><h2>Thursday Night Football NFL best bets </h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Los Angeles Rams vs. San Francisco 49ers (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Under 45.5 (-115)</strong></li></ul><p>\"Anybody wanna play a skill position on offense for the 49ers? Vacancies abound. Barely a month into the season, San Fran's unit has been nearly wiped out by injury. For this game, QB Brock Purdy and WRs Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings and Jordan Watkins were declared out Wednesday,\" SportsLine NFL expert Mike Tierney (11-6 on last 17 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/picks/experts/\">NFL picks</a>) said. \"Previous casualties include WR Brandon Aiyuk and TE George Kittle. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan has gotten the better of Sean McVay in the regular season, going 10-4 SU, so his defense could keep the Rams in check. But points surely will be hard to come by, which makes this mid-level total seem a tad high.\"</p><p><strong>More NFL best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\"

The model projects the Rams to cover as 8.5-point favorites with the 49ers without quarterback Brock Purdy (toe) and other starters as one of its Thursday best bets. It also expects New Mexico State to upset Sam Houston as +114 underdogs in a matchup on CBS Sports Network at 9 p.m. ET to include in Thursday best bets at DraftKings.

Purdy is the most notable injury, but even as Mac Jones steps in after going 2-0 as a starter this season, he'll be without two key playmakers who aided him in those victories with Jauan Jennings﻿﻿﻿ (ankle/ribs) and Ricky Pearsall﻿﻿﻿ (knee) both out. The 49ers remain without Brandon Aiyuk, who has been on IR all season with a knee injury, leaving Jones with limited options. San Francisco defeated the Saints and Cardinals in one-score victories with Jones, and a road matchup against the 3-1 Rams will be a significantly tougher challenge. The Rams are a blocked field goal away from a 4-0 start as well, and as the significantly healthier team, the model favors Los Angeles for a more comfortable victory. The model projects the Rams to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>New Mexico State (+114) to defeat Sam Houston</h2><p>The home team has won each of their two meetings over the last two seasons, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Thursday. New Mexico State defeated Sam Houston, 27-13, in 2023 before falling in this matchup, 31-11, in Texas last year. But Sam Houston is off to an 0-4 start this season, while New Mexico State is 2-2. New Mexico State is one of the most pass-heavy teams in the nation, and the unit can capitalize on Sam Houston's weaknesses with the strategy. Sam Houston ranks 131st of 136 teams in passing yards allowed (321.8 yards per game), while ranking 127th in completion percentage against (70.34%). New Mexico is 28th in the nation in passing yards (274 per game) behind fifth-year quarterback Logan Fife. The Aggies have three different receivers with more than 200 yards this season as well. The model projects an upset on Thursday, with New Mexico State winning in 54% of simulations, projecting strong value at plus-money odds.</p><h2>Yankees (-162) to defeat the Red Sox</h2><p>The Yankees were one of the hottest teams in baseball to close the regular season, winning eight straight games and 11 of 12 contests to finish 94-68 on the season. New York finished five games ahead of Boston (89-73) this season, behind the No. 1 offense in baseball (5.21 runs per game). Aaron Judge, the favorite to win the AL MVP, is 4-for-8 this postseason after leading baseball in categories such as batting average (.331) and OPS (1.144). Although both the Yankees and Red Sox are starting rookies, New York has the experience advantage on the mound with Connelly Early, 23, making just his fifth career start for Boston. Yankees starter Cam Schlittler, 24, went 4-3 with a 2.96 ERA in 14 starts this year. New York went 50-31 at Yankee Stadium, while Boston was just 41-40 away from Fenway Park. The model expects the Yankees to take advantage of homefield advantage, projecting New York to win in 65% of simulations. </p><h2>Want more MLB picks and Thursday Night Football picks for Thursday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Thursday best bets.

According to the latest Week 6 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/odds/\" target=\"_blank\">college football odds</a>, the Crimson Tide are favored by 10.5 points at home, while the over/under for total points scored is 56.5.

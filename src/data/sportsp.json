Instead, Roach will move to the junior welterweight division to face Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz in a bout for Cruz's interim WBC title on Dec. 6, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/46468337/lamont-roach-jr-moving-fight-isaac-cruz-140-pound-title\" target=\"_blank\">as reported by ESPN</a>.</p><p>Roach battled Davis to a draw in their March clash for Davis' WBA lightweight title. Sentiment was near unanimous that Roach deserved the win in the fight, and a rematch was immediately on the table. Davis' team seemed uninterested in pursuing the rematch as time went on and he now is set for a strange <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-gervonta-davis-fight-rules-explained-weight-limits-and-bigger-gloves-among-unique-regulations/\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition bout with Jake Paul in November</a></span>.</p><p>Rather than sit on the sidelines and wait to see if Davis would return to the negotiating table after the Paul fight, Roach now heads up to 140 pounds for a showdown with Cruz, bringing the momentum of a seven-fight unbeaten streak and public sentiment that he should be a world champion with him.</p>\n<p>Cruz has his own history with Davis, having been very competitive in their 2021 fight and gunning for a rematch in the following years that would never come to fruition.</p><p>Four fights after losing to Davis, Cruz won his first world championship, stopping Rolly Romero to win the WBA title at 140 pounds. He would drop a split decision to Jose Valenzuela and lose the title in his next fight, but has since rebounded with back-to-back victories. In his most recent fight, Cruz won the interim title with a win over Omar Salcido.</p>\n<p>The winner will be in line for a title shot against Subriel Matias, who took a majority decision over Alberto Puello in July to win the belt.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

UFC CEO Dana White recently revealed that the company will spend $700,000 just on grass. </p><p>The mixed martial arts organization is currently planning a card at The White House, tentatively set for sometime in June. The unique endeavor comes with unexpected logistical problems. On Wednesday, White revealed that the company will spend well into the six figures to repair the grass that will be damaged on the South Lawn, where the Octagon will be stationed.</p><p>\"This is just  one little piece I was talking about  last night: To replace the grass,  because we're going to f--- up the  South Lawn, $700,000 just to  replace the grass,\" White told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/10/01/ufc-to-spend-700000-replacing-white-house-lawn-after-2026-fight-card/\">Sports Business Journal</a>.   </p><p>Such unique challenges underscore White's apprehension towards non-arena shows. He's historically avoided booking stadiums or outdoor venues with rare exceptions, such as UFC 306 at The Sphere and Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford at Allegiant Stadium, both in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>\"There is no doubt about it, this is going to be the most challenging event we have ever done,\" White said. \"I'm coming off a stadium event, which I don't like stadiums, to the  thing that I hate the most in outdoor events.\"</p><p>That being said, White <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/dana-white-says-canelo-alvarez-vs-terence-crawford-could-open-door-for-ufc-stadium-shows/\" target=\"_blank\">told CBS Sports</a></span> in advance of Canelo vs. Crawford that the show's success could entice him to book the UFC's first-ever stadium show stateside. </p>\n<p>The UFC's White House show has changed greatly since President Trump <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-confirms-president-donald-trumps-plans-for-white-house-fight-card-conor-mcgregor-says-count-me-in/\" target=\"_blank\">first proposed it</a></span>. Originally suggested for America's 250th birthday, the card is now expected to take place in June instead of the July 4th weekend. Trump also suggested 20,000 to 25,000 spectators would attend; however, White says the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-ceo-dana-white-capacity-will-be-limited-for-event-at-white-house-but-has-plans-for-fans-to-attend-nearby/\" target=\"_blank\">number will be closer to 5,000</a></span> -- with a nearby park accommodating upwards of 85,000.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

NFL player props figure to center on big names like Matthew Stafford, Christian McCaffrey, Kyren Williams and Puka Nacua, but you may be able to find value with NFL prop lines for under-the-radar players. Brian Robinson Jr. has had a consistent role as McCaffrey's backup with at least 20 rushing yards in each game. His Thursday Night Football props for rushing have a bar of just 19.5, with NFL prop odds of -114 for the Over.</p><p>With the Rams' defense second in the league with 14 sacks -- and with San Fran ruling out Brock Purdy (toe) and some key receivers -- the Niners may lean more on the run on TNF. McCaffrey leads the NFL in touches (100), and given the short week, San Francisco may call upon Robinson more than usual, making his NFL prop bet one to consider. Other rushing yard NFL prop totals include 59.5 for McCaffrey and 67.5 for Williams.

Stafford is averaging 278.5 passing yards on the season as he ranks second in passing yards entering Week 5. He's had at least 245 yards in three of four starts, in addition to having at least 243 passing yards in six of his last seven home starts dating back to last year's regular season.</p><p>Stafford should have little deterrence from San Fran's defense, as the Niners' current 11-game streak without an interception is tied for the longest by any NFL team since 1940. With Nick Bosa (knee) out for the year, the 49ers had zero sacks last week, and a lack of pass rush will allow wideouts like Nacua and Davante Adams to run free in the secondary. The model projects Stafford to have 281.4 passing yards, giving this prop bet a 4.5-star rating. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/prop-picks/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_AImodel_Rams49ersAIprops\" target=\"_blank\">See more NFL props here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to make NFL player prop bets for Rams vs. 49ers</h2><p>In addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has 13 additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/prop-picks/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_AImodel_Rams49ersAIprops\" target=\"_blank\">You need to see the Machine Learning Model analysis before making any 49ers vs. Rams prop bets for Thursday Night Football</a>.</p><p><strong>Which Rams vs. 49ers prop bets should you target for Thursday Night Football? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/prop-picks/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_AImodel_Rams49ersAIprops\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see the top 49ers vs. Rams props, all from the SportsLine Machine Learning Model</a>.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>For a while now, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/teams/\">MLB teams</a> have generally avoided hiring managers from the college ranks.

Now that several pitching coaches have successfully made the jump from college to the big leagues, Bowden said teams are more open to plucking managers from that level as well.</p><p>More specifically, a trio of highly successful college managers keep coming up in discussions Bowden has had with MLB executives. Link Jarrett, Tim Corbin and Tony Vitello will all get some interest from teams looking to hire a new manager this offseason.</p><p>\"In all my conversations with GMs and executives around the league, there are three names that come up all the time in terms of college coaches they believe can manage in the big leagues right now,\" Bowden said. \"There's Link Jarrett from Florida State, Tim Corbin from Vanderbilt and Tony Vitello from Tennessee. Those are the three names I keep hearing over and over again. I won't be surprised if one of the three gets one of the eight openings this offseason. That's something to watch.\"</p>\n<p>Jarrett, 53, has been a manager since he took over at UNC Greensboro in 2013. He spent three years at Notre Dame from 2020-22, and he's been with the Seminoles ever since. Jarrett's overall record is 415-262 with two College World Series appearances and two more NCAA Super Regional appearances.</p><p>Vitello, 46, has taken the Tennessee baseball program to new heights since arriving in 2018. He is 341-131 with the Vols, and he led them to a national championship in 2024. He has two more College World Series appearances and four total SEC titles (regular season and tournament).</p><p>The longest résumé of that trio belongs to Corbin, a 64-year-old entering his 24th season at Vanderbilt. Corbin has more than 1,000 career wins at the college level, two national championships, five College World Series appearances, four SEC tournament championships and four SEC regular season titles.</p>\n<p>The team most likely to give one of those managers an MLB opportunity is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">San Francisco Giants</a>. According to Bowden, Giants president of baseball operations <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1660162/buster-posey/\">Buster Posey</a> is keeping an open mind when it comes to potential replacements for Bob Melvin.</p><p>\"In particular, watch the San Francisco Giants here because I keep hearing Buster Posey is very open to thinking out of the box and hiring one of these college coaches,\" Posey said.</p><p>Posey provided support for this when asked about the idea of bringing Bruce Bochy, who was fired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a>, back to San Francisco. Posey <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/why-giants-executive-buster-posey-ruled-out-a-bruce-bochy-reunion-amid-search-for-new-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">effectively shot down the suggestion</a></span>, saying the Giants would be going a different direction.</p>\n            </div>",

Really, first and foremost as the head coach, it's not a reflection on one player. It's on me.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NY/new-york-knicks/\">Knicks</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/PHI/philadelphia-76ers/\">76ers</a> are opening up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/schedule/\">NBA preseason</a> action in Abu Dhabi with a pair of games Thursday and Saturday as part of the league's expanding global reach. These are two teams that could very well meet in the playoffs -- perhaps even the Eastern Conference Final -- if both sides stay healthy enough. But health has been an issue for both teams in the last few years, and Thursday afternoon was no different.</p><p>In the early minutes of the second quarter, Knicks guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2105193/josh-hart/\">Josh Hart</a> went to corral a rebound off a missed 3-pointer from Sixers rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26541715/johni-broome/\">Johni Broome</a>. Hart fell to the ground shortly after getting the rebound, and a jump ball was called after Sixers' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26777219/kennedy-chandler/\">Kennedy Chandler</a> tied up the ball with Hart. As the official called for the jump ball, Hart, threw the ball into the air across the court and was writhing in pain as it appeared he tweaked his back in the midst of it all. Though Hart appeared to toss the ball in frustration, the official gave Hart a technical foul and decided it was grounds for an immediate ejection, too.</p><p>Here's how it played out:</p>\n<p>It's a pretty head-scratching situation given Hart was injured on the play and appeared to throw the ball as a way to get Chandler away from him while he was in pain. But the official clearly didn't view it that way. Hart limped back to the locker room after getting off the floor and will surely be evaluated in the near future.</p><p>After the 99-84 loss, Knicks coach Mike Brown said that Hart has lower back soreness and will see how he feels tomorrow ahead of Saturday's game.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't see him go down, I just saw him down and he looked like he was in considerable pain,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/NBA_NewYork/status/1973831370037195217\" target=\"_blank\">Brown said</a>. \"But he's day-to-day and we'll see how he feels tomorrow.\"</p><p>Sixers coach Nick Nurse had a front row seat to Hart's injury, as it all happened right in front of Philly's bench.</p><p>\"I thought something really bad happened,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/StevePopper/status/1973837184403976511\" target=\"_blank\">Nurse said</a>. \"He wasn't in a collision, it was on his own I think, those always are scary. He was in a lot of pain. I don't know what the verdict was. Let's hope it's not serious, but I did think it was something very serious at the beginning. I was trying to get everybody's attention, like, 'Let's go, get out here.' And let's hope he's okay.\"</p><p>From the sounds of Brown's comments, it appears the injury isn't anything serious, which is a massive sigh of relief for the Knicks. In many ways, Hart is the -- no pun intended -- heart of the Knicks, especially on defense. He's a do-it-all player who isn't afraid to put his body on the line, as evidenced from this play. </p>\n<p>Hart's already dealing with a finger injury that will require him to wear a splint this season after having surgery on it during the summer. Adding a back injury to the list certainly isn't ideal, especially this early into the season, but it doesn't sound like he'll be missing too much time.</p>\n            </div>",

This game will feature two great running backs, with Kyren Williams and Christian McCaffrey looking like two of the league's true bellcow ball carriers through the first month of the season. Williams is listed as high as -185 in the latest NFL anytime touchdown scorer odds, while you can find McCaffrey to score a TD for as high as -120. McCaffrey could see a heavy workload on Thursday with quarterback Brock Purdy (toe) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee).

That includes five touchdowns in three career games against the 49ers and three touchdowns against San Francisco in SoFi Stadium last season. He's scored in 23 of his last 32 regular-season games, and <strong>the model predicts that he scores 0.93 touchdowns on average, while his implied touchdown probability is 64.9%.</strong></p><h2>Davante Adams, Rams (+115, DraftKings)</h2><p>At 32, Adams is coming off his sixth 1,000-yard season in seven years and is still incredibly productive in general. Now he slots in as the No. 2 receiver in Los Angeles behind Puka Nacua, and it's looked like an ideal fit in the first four games. Despite being questionable for the game with a hamstring injury, Adams scored for a third consecutive week in a win over the Colts on Sunday, and he has a staggering 47.1% red-zone target share thus far. <strong>The model predicts he scores 0.63 touchdowns on average, while his odds imply a 46.5% chance of scoring</strong>.</p><h2>Marquez Valdes-Scantling (+1300, FanDuel)</h2><p>The veteran has only suited up three times for the 49ers, and he's only been targeted twice, but he's been capable of catching lightning in a bottle throughout his career with the Packers, Chiefs, Bills and Saints. He's scored 20 times in his career, and 11 of those scores have been for 40 yards or more. Jauan Jennings (ankle) and Ricky Pearsall (knee) were both DNPs early in the week, and their snaps will likely be limited to some extent on a short week if they're able to play at all. <strong>The model predicts Valdes-Scantling scores 0.14 touchdowns on average, while his implied scoring probability is 7.1%</strong>.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO</span> – It's 10 steps from the sidewalk outside of Wrigley Field's right-field-to-center-field stretch to the sidewalk on the east side of Sheffield Avenue. Among other reasons, it's that tantalizing proximity -- that physical immediacy -- that makes the 3600 block of Sheffield the Best Block in Baseball. </p><p>Depending upon your standards and druthers, you may have a different answer to this implied question that probably no one is asking. Quite defensibly, Fenway would have its advocates, as would newer entries like PNC Park in Pittsburgh and Oracle Park and others. Yes, Camden Yards, of course. It says here, though, that the peculiarities of Sheffield Avenue just outside Wrigley, the long-gone history that lurks behind them, and the city-ness of it all conspire to make this the Best Block in Baseball. </p><p>Specific to Wrigley, Waveland Avenue just beyond the left-field wall can no doubt muster a case, especially once you lay eyes on the Engine 78 firehouse so near at hand. It rings a bit too loudly of the familiar, though, what with all the home runs from right-handed batters that find the blacktop and all the rooftop venues and their 36stadium seating. Even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/getting-to-know-the-ballhawks-of-wrigley-field/\">the ballhawks</a> don't show up there much anymore. In some ways, Waveland between Seminary and Sheffield feels too much like an outgrowth of the ballpark. Waveland is a section of Wrigley that happens to be outside the walls. Sheffield is a friendly neighbor. Clark? It's 20 steps. Addison? It's even more. Not even a discussion. </p><p>Inside the ballpark, Sheffield naturally draws the eyes. Sit in the aerie that is the 400 section along the third base line, especially toward home plate, and you can see Lake Michigan, which because of its breadth, waves, and blue hues in the summer might as well be an ocean. There's also this trundling above the alley behind Sheffield: </p>\n<figure><p><img alt=\"20251002-150009.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/a485d0b6-337a-48fd-a3c2-52d252c95444/resize/670x377/e2f85f9cf2ea10b540055859c3407e96/20251002-150009.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>That's of course, the \"L.\" In this case, it's the elevated portion of the CTA Red Line, which ferries people to, among other destinations, the Addison stop just outside Wrigley. This one's headed south. Two stops after Addison it will dip underground at Fullerton and not emerge again until Roosevelt south of downtown. Thirteen stops south of Addison, it'll arrive at the White Sox's ballpark, whatever they're calling it these days. When you're at a Cubs game facing east and it snakes by, it's a reminder you're watching baseball in a city, where the game at this level belongs. </p><p>It's really about that 10 steps outside the park, though. Bear witness: </p><figure><p><img alt=\"20251002-145228.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/d15f815a-f0e0-4585-a58b-0277388357bf/resize/670x377/df4ae66f9c288a13ae721039d6e5991f/20251002-145228.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>The north end of the block is home to Murphy's Bleachers, a baseball bar in the most authentic sense of the term, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://murphysbleachers.com/history/\">the origins of which go back almost a century</a>. At the south end of the block is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sportscornerwrigley.com/\">Sports Corner</a>, which has been around a \"mere\" half-century. In between on that tree-lined and leafy-for-most-of-the-year east side of the block, you have a stretch of apartments and homes, almost all of them Chicago's signature greystone buildings that date back to the 19th century as an effort to \"proof\" the city after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.</p><p>That those slivers of history mostly house Chicagoans rather than serve as low-slung bars or storefront souvenir peddlers makes a walk down Sheffield about as \"neighborhoody\" as it can be given that it's, you know, 10 steps from Wrigley. </p>\n<p>That such a close relationship exists is a testament to how ballparks used to be built in this country. I explained the difference between then and now in a 2018 piece about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/the-white-sox-ballpark-in-chicago-that-never-was-and-could-have-changed-history/\">the architect Philip Bess and his vision for a White Sox ballpark that lamentably never came to be</a>: </p><blockquote><p>\"When a team these days decides they want a new ballpark, they typically have a list of must-haves, be they practical or aesthetic in nature -- spacious clubhouses, heated batting cages, a large video board, luxury suites, expanses of parking, and so on. In essence, here's what we want; where can we fit it? Or, alternatively: What can we raze and relocate and eminent-domain out of the way in order to fit it? Newer parks tend to be, in Bess' words, 'program-driven,' which means the team decides what it wants in its new park and then finds enough space to accommodate every desire. Thus the street grid-busting 'superblocks' on which so many modern ballparks sit. </p><p>\"Older parks, in contrast, were 'site-driven,' in that the architects started with the available plot of land and fit what they could into it. That's why the dimensional idiosyncrasies -- think of left field in Fenway or right field in the Baker Bowl -- weren't mere contrivances. Rather, they were essential design elements that allowed the park to fit into those existing city blocks. In the old way, park features grew out of a prioritizing, and that prioritizing was informed by the park's necessarily limited physical footprint. The old parks were shaped by their neighborhoods.\"</p></blockquote><p>Wrigley is about as site-driven as a ballpark can be, and nowhere is that more acute than the 3600 block of Sheffield, where the ballpark casts shadows upon the homes -- upon the swath of city neighborhood -- that long preceded it. Such ballparks, which are built to accommodate the city around it and not the other way around -- are so long-ago as to be quaint.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>You'll forgive even the most ardent Arizona State fans if they didn't have particularly high hopes when No. 6 Oregon came to town Nov. 23, 2019. After losing to Auburn to open the season, the Ducks had reeled off nine straight wins, including a 56-24 thumping of USC and a 34-6 blowout of Arizona in the previous two weeks. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> in discussions to be the No. 1 overall pick in a 2020 draft class that also included <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741209/tua-tagovailoa/\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>. The Ducks were 13.5-point road favorites. </p><p>The Sun Devils, meanwhile, were headed in the opposite direction. After a 5-1 start, they had lost four straight to fall to 5-5. Freshman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> was racking up the numbers and showing moments of being the next big thing, but the Sun Devils' defense was struggling, and a season that had started with so much promise now looked like it might end without even a bowl berth.</p><p>And then the unexpected happened: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/oregon-vs-arizona-state-score-sun-devils-upset-no-6-ducks-holding-off-furious-comeback/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Arizona State 31, No. 6 Oregon 28</a>.

It's their first meeting as pros, but given the nature of their 2019 duel, they certainly remember one another well.</p>\n<h2>How the game played out</h2><p>After the game opened with consecutive punts, the Oregon offense embarked on an 11-play, 80-yard drive, capped by Cyrus Habibi-Likio's 5-yard plunge into the end zone.</p><p>But as would be the case most of the night, Daniels would answer back with a big play, this time a 57-yard touchdown to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2242757/frank-darby/\">Frank Darby</a>.</p>\n<p>The real star of the game through the first three quarters, though, was the Arizona State defense. The Sun Devils entered halftime up 10-7 and tacked on a field goal in the third quarter to make it 13-7 with 15 minutes to go. Keep in mind the Ducks had scored at least 34 points in four straight games.</p>\n<p>The very first play of the fourth quarter, somehow, got even worse for Oregon: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2242763/jack-jones/\">Jack Jones</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/CoachCrocky/status/1198438475462086656/video/1\" target=\"_blank\">picked off</a> Herbert, and set up with great field position, Daniels found Darby for a 26-yard score.</p>\n<p>Herbert then <a href=\"https://x.com/jacobrosenfarb/status/1198445104605753345/video/1\" target=\"_blank\">got picked off again</a>, this time by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161131/khaylan-kearse-thomas/\">Khaylan Kearse-Thomas</a>, and another Arizona State field goal made it 24-7 with under nine minutes left.</p><p>Then things got bonkers.</p><p>Oregon went 75 yards in three plays, with a screen pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2864938/johnny-johnson-iii/\">Johnny Johnson III</a> going for 39 yards and leading to Habibi-Likio's second touchdown of the night. After an Arizona State three and out, the Ducks needed just three plays to score again, this time via three Herbert-to-Johnson connections, including this 24-yard touchdown.</p>\n<p>With his lead down to just 24-21, Daniels had another massive answer: an 81-yard dime to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967489/brandon-aiyuk/\">Brandon Aiyuk</a> to all but seal the game:</p>\n<p>Herbert would find Johnson for one late touchdown, but Arizona State recovered the onside kick and managed one first down to clinch it. The field storming came moments later.</p>\n<p>\"We should be playing like that all the time really, but we have something to prove,\" Daniels said after the game. \"We lost so many games in a row, so this win just felt different. They just happen to be the No. 6 ranked team. These guys owed them something from last year, took (ASU's) chances from the Pac-12 Championship, so just came out there and played with a chip on their shoulders.\"</p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2><p>Oregon bounced back with wins over Oregon State to finish the regular season and No. 5 Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game, earning the conference's Rose Bowl berth. In the Rose Bowl, Herbert ran for three scores, including the game-winning 30-yarder in the fourth quarter, to lift the Ducks over No. 8 Wisconsin. A few months later, the Chargers took Herbert sixth overall. He was the third quarterback selected, after Burrow (first to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a>) and Tagovailoa (fifth to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>).</p><p>The Sun Devils also finished their 2019 season strong, beating Arizona in the regular-season finale and Florida State in the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Daniels was the game's MVP/</p><p>From there, though, it became a much different story for Daniels and for Arizona State. The Sun Devils played just four games in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ahead of the 2021 season, the Sun Devils <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/arizona-state-under-ncaa-investigation-for-alleged-recruiting-violations-during-dead-period-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">fell under NCAA investigation for alleged recruiting violations during the dead period</a></span>. Daniels' mother, Regina Jackson, was part of the investigation for allegedly paying for flights for recruits and those accompanying them on visits, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/yahoo-sports-exclusive-dossier-reveals-extent-of-ncaa-allegations-against-arizona-state-football-055252113.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAf2f9GVmn5lQrBrajRJ6hdNuOANnHovypI6JE26ntIbBJWzVHWnwEhE6n2QIl2-cbik23TnW-vmttwJWz6YiOLiTQ78us16me6cFmbY6FpjHL2mr9qb9A14ftGAET4OezCFHFExkQJhf1CdPsffIvaSPJoI2uYRP-mLYe8UfePk\" target=\"_blank\">as uncovered by Yahoo Sports</a>.

Shortly thereafter, though, he entered the transfer portal; Sun Devils players infamously <a href=\"https://x.com/georgewrighster/status/1494399324347764751\" target=\"_blank\">raided his locker</a> after his announcement, and Daniels ended up at LSU, where he'd go on to win the Heisman Trophy after the 2023 season.</p><p>Both quarterbacks have had tremendous success early in their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> careers, too. Herbert's 21,093 passing yards through five seasons are most ever by a player through his first five years. Daniels led Washington to its first NFC Championship Game appearance since 1991 in his first season. Both won Offensive Rookie of the Year. Now, nearly six years after that magical night in Tempe, they meet again.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NAVY/navy-midshipmen/\">Navy</a> will look to continue one of the nation's longest winning streaks and take a step towards winning the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy for the second year in a row Saturday as it hosts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AF/air-force-falcons/\">Air Force</a>. The Midshipmen are once again off to a 4-0 start, while Air Force is stumbling a bit amidst another 1-3 record through the first four games of the year. </p><p>It's been over a decade since Navy last won back-to-back Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, which is the ultimate expression of service academy dominance, and it's won just five trophies since the start of the 2010s. Air Force, meanwhile, hasn't won the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy since 2022, and it has claimed the prize just twice over the last nine years. </p><p>Saturday's showdown is the first of three in the race for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, all of which will be televised by CBS. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARMY/army-west-point-black-knights/\">Army</a> hosts Air Force on Nov. 1 in the second leg before the all-important Army vs. Navy game on Dec. 13.</p><p>While Navy is the only service academy program with a winning record thus far, the race for service academy superiority is almost always tight. As that scramble gets underway, here are some things to know about the quest for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy.  </p>\n<h2>Where to watch Navy vs. Air Force live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: Noon ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium -- Annapolis, Maryland</p><p><strong>TV: </strong>CBS | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/armed-forces/LET-189693694\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/QeYaC8MVDqb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a> <br /><strong>Streaming on</strong> <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a> (Try It Free)</p><h2>Commander-in-Chief's Trophy history </h2><p>The Commander-in-Chief's Trophy was established for the 1972 season, and all three programs have enjoyed runs of success in the series. Air Force leads the way with 21 trophies, followed by Navy with 17 and Army with 10. However, the Black Knights have won or retained the trophy in five of the past seven seasons.</p>\n<p>Navy's golden era came between 2003-09 when the Midshipmen won seven straight Commander-in-Chief's Trophies. Air Force also won it five times in a seven-year span between 2010-16 after dominating the series in the 1990s and early 2000s. The winning team typically visits the White House, where the president presents the the trophy, which is engraved with each of the academy's seals.</p><h2>History on Navy's side ... with a win </h2><p>There are quite a few parallels between Navy beating Air Force and Navy winning the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. Perhaps it's because the Midshipmen get an early head start on the competition by getting a victory in the books. </p><p>But Navy has won the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy in 12 of the last 13 seasons that it has beaten Air Force. The Midshipmen are also going for consecutive wins against the Falcons for the first time since 2012-13, which is is the last time that it won back-to-back Commander-in-Chief's trophies. Momentum is certainly on Navy's side to get it done. </p>\n<p>The Midshipmen have won seven games in a row dating back to the 2024 season, tied for the fourth-longest active streak in the FBS and their longest as a program in a decade. Navy also started 4-0 in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1978-79. </p><p>Navy has an explosive offense to thank for its success thus far. Led by dynamic quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901593/blake-horvath/\">Blake Horvath</a>, who is also comfortable passing the ball, the Midshipmen lead the nation with 352.3 yards rushing per game. They're also going for 455-plus total yards of offense in a fifth straight game for the first time in program history. </p>\n<h2>Air Force trying to turn things around </h2><p>Air Force won 29 games from 2021-23 and the 2022 Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, but the Falcons haven't had a winning season since. They started the 2024 campaign off with an abysmal 1-7 record before turning things around with four straight wins over their final four regular season games. That late-season surge did not carry over into the 2025 campaign. </p>\n<p>Air Force has its back against the wall once again with a 1-3 start to the year. Its only win thus far came in the season opener against FCS <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BUCK/bucknell-bison/\">Bucknell</a>. Dating back to the start of the 2024 season, Air Force is 4-10 against FBS competition. </p><p>While the Falcons were plagued by offensive issues last season, they got their offense fixed entering 2025 ... just in time for the defense to plummet off a cliff. Air Force is the only FBS team averaging and allowing 37-plus points per game this season. All three of Air Force's FBS opponents have scored at least 40 points. </p>\n            </div>",

The two NL Central foes will square off in the playoffs for the first time ever. The Cubs won the season series, 7-6, but the Brewers still won the division title by five games. In fact, they finished with the best record in baseball at 97-65. As such, the Brewers got a bye and have had nearly a week off. The Cubs dealt with a hard-fought Wild Card Series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">Padres</a>, winning 2-1, in order to make it here. </p><p>The winner of this series will face the winner of the Dodgers-Phillies series in the NLCS for the pennant. The Cubs haven't won the pennant since 2016, and that was their only one since 1945. The Brewers have never won the NL pennant (though they did win the AL pennant in 1982).</p><h2>Cubs vs. Brewers schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time/score</th><th>TV</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sat., Oct. 4</p></td><td><p>2:08 or 9:08 pm ET</p></td><td><p>TBS</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Mon., Oct. 6</p></td><td><p>9:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>TBS</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 3</strong></td><td>Wed., Oct. 8</td><td>TBD</td><td>TBS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 4 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Thur., Oct. 9</td><td>TBD</td><td>TBS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 5 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Sat., Oct. 10</td><td>TBD</td><td>TBS</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Cubs vs. Brewers: Game 1 info</h2><ul><li><strong>Time</strong>: 2:08 or 9:08 p.m. ET | <strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: American Family Field -- Milwaukee</li><li><strong>TV channel</strong>: TBS | <strong>Live stream</strong>: HBO Max</li><li><strong>Starting pitchers</strong>: TBD (CHC) vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2900486/freddy-peralta/\">Freddy Peralta</a> (MIL)</li><li><strong>Odds</strong>: Brewers -148, Cubs +126 | O/U: 7</li></ul><h2>Game 1 storylines</h2><p><strong>Cubs</strong>: The one day off should be enough for the Cubs to get their very-good bullpen in workable shape before Game 1 of this series, but there's at least some concern surrounding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2228478/andrew-kittredge/\">Andrew Kittredge</a> (threw all three games in the Wild Card Series) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/\">Brad Keller</a> (visibly ran out of gas in the ninth inning of Game 3). The Cubs bring in one of the strongest offenses in baseball, though it was mostly held at bay in the Wild Card Series by the Padres' excellent pitching staff. The Brewers also have great pitching.</p><p><strong>Brewers</strong>: Will the break do the Brewers some good or trigger a little rust? They were 19-21 in their last 40 games in the regular season and swept the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in Dodger Stadium after the All-Star break, which is a similar number of days off. This is an argument that the break was probably good for them. Peralta, who finished 17-6 with a 2.70 ERA this season, is the best pitcher in the series and will be looking to come through with an ace outing to get his team on top.</p>\n<h2>Series odds, prediction</h2><ul><li><strong>Series odds</strong> (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>): Brewers -116 | Cubs +100</li></ul><p>Not much would surprise me here. This is two very good teams that are awfully familiar with one another. There are concerns with the Brewers' rotation behind Peralta and I'll wager the Cubs get rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920010/cade-horton/\">Cade Horton</a> back. The Cubs have a more powerful offense, too, so I'll say that also makes a difference. <strong>Cubs in 5</strong>. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>",

The main event features a light heavyweight championship rematch between Magomed Ankalaev and the man he defeated to become champion, Alex Pereira. In their first meeting, Ankalaev controlled much of the action to take a unanimous decision.</p><p>The co-main event features Merab Dvalishvili putting the UFC bantamweight title on the line against Cory Sandhagen. Dvalishvili has been a tornado of aggression, winning 13 straight fights. Sandhagen has won four of his five most recent fights and is getting his first crack at the full championship, having previously lost an interim title fight to Petr Yan in 2021.</p><p>There is plenty more intriguing action set for the event, including a light heavyweight showdown between top five opponents Khalil Rountree and Jiri Prochazka.</p><p>It's the kind of card that may motivate you to add some spice by hitting the sportsbooks and placing a wager or two. With that in mind, we've taken a look at all five main card fights for Saturday's event in Las Vegas to identify the best bet in each.</p>\n<p>After a slightly disappointing 2-3 result for our best bets for UFC 319, our 2025 record sits at 20-18. We'll look to get our roll going again on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-fight-card-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-five-biggest-storylines-to-watch-in-las-vegas/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320 fight card -- Magomed Ankalaev vs. Alex Pereira 2: Five biggest storylines to watch in Las Vegas</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320 fight card -- Magomed Ankalaev vs. Alex Pereira 2: Five biggest storylines to watch in Las Vegas\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/30/24782568-7d35-41bd-94f7-557d8882e95e/thumbnail/270x152/60b1e33c02dda8e78edce84389a6f62e/pereira-ankalaev-313-weighins.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Abus Magomedov\tvs.\tJoe Pyfer</h2><p><strong>Fight to go the distance: No (-245)</strong></p><p>This line sits right on the edge of our odds range, but it makes for a solid parlay booster. Pyfer is a solid favorite to win at -265, though Magomedov is a dangerous opponent. We're going against trends a bit, with Pyfer going to decision in two of his three most recent fights and Magomedov in three of his four most recent. That said, Pyfer has gone to decision in just three of his 17 career fights, and Magomedov has nine decision results in his 35 bouts. This fight may take a bit of time to find the finish, but it should end before hitting the scorecards.</p><h2>Josh Emmett\tvs.\tYoussef Zalal</h2><p><strong>Youssef Zalal via submission (+450)</strong></p><p>Emmett is a tough veteran on a 1-3 run against very good competition. He's also a 40-year-old in a young man's division. Zalal is a big, strong featherweight with a good amount of speed. Zalal is also operating at a better level than he has at any point in his career, really leaning into his grappling. Zalal averages more than two takedowns per 15 minutes and Emmett's takedown defense is leaky at times, with only a 46% defense rate. Yair Rodriguez caught Emmett in an arm-triangle choke four fights ago and Zalal has a solid choke game, both from the back with rear-naked chokes or when he is able to advance position and lock in an arm-triangle, as he did two fights ago against Jack Shore. This is a pretty juicy line and worth a play.</p>\n<h2>Jiri Prochazka\tvs.\tKhalil Rountree Jr.</h2><p><strong>Under 1.5 rounds (+114)</strong></p><p>This feels like a coin flip fight that could end at any second. Prochazka has built a wildly successful UFC career for someone with such leaky defense. Pereira has twice made Prochazka pay for defensive irresponsibility, but every other UFC opponent eventually got caught by his wide-open striking style. Rountree is plenty willing to throw down in a firefight as well, as seen in his stunningly competitive title fight with Pereira. The mix of styles here feels like it's perfectly set up for big exchanges right from the opening bell, with Rountree absorbing 4.24 strikes per minute and Prochazka 5.7, and both have enough power to end the fight in a flash. For that reason, we're leaning toward the under in an explosive light heavyweight contest.</p><h2>Merab Dvalishvili vs.\tCory Sandhagen</h2><p><strong>Merab Dvalishvili over 5.5 takedowns (-150)</strong></p><p>The thinking is simple on this pick. Dvalishvili averages 5.84 takedowns per 15 minutes and this is a 25 minute fight. Sandhagen has 63% takedown defense and that's against men who aren't bringing the never-ending pressure and takedowns of Dvalishvili. Even if the champ feels like spending some time striking, he's going to take Sandhagen down frequently enough that the over should hit. The fight is -330 to go the distance, which means the oddsmakers expect this to go the full five rounds, which is more than enough time for Dvalishvili to impose his will.</p><h2>Magomed Ankalaev vs.\tAlex Pereira</h2><p><strong>Fight to end by KO/TKO/DQ (-120)</strong></p><p>Whether Pereira was only \"40%\" coming into the first fight or not, he's always a threat to win any fight by knockout. And Ankalaev, in the middle of Ramadan, may not have been at the peak of his physical conditioning in that fight and still outlanded the kickboxer. This is a case where both fighters should be better because of those factors, as well as five rounds of experience sharing the Octagon. Expect a bit more aggressive of an approach from Pereira, who knows he can't allow the rematch to play out the way the first meeting did. That either means violent success for Pereira, or some big openings for Ankalaev to exploit with his own power. We're liking an explosive finish to this one.</p>\n            </div>",

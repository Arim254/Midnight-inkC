Instead, Roach will move to the junior welterweight division to face Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz in a bout for Cruz's interim WBC title on Dec. 6, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/46468337/lamont-roach-jr-moving-fight-isaac-cruz-140-pound-title\" target=\"_blank\">as reported by ESPN</a>.</p><p>Roach battled Davis to a draw in their March clash for Davis' WBA lightweight title. Sentiment was near unanimous that Roach deserved the win in the fight, and a rematch was immediately on the table. Davis' team seemed uninterested in pursuing the rematch as time went on and he now is set for a strange <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-gervonta-davis-fight-rules-explained-weight-limits-and-bigger-gloves-among-unique-regulations/\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition bout with Jake Paul in November</a></span>.</p><p>Rather than sit on the sidelines and wait to see if Davis would return to the negotiating table after the Paul fight, Roach now heads up to 140 pounds for a showdown with Cruz, bringing the momentum of a seven-fight unbeaten streak and public sentiment that he should be a world champion with him.</p>\n<p>Cruz has his own history with Davis, having been very competitive in their 2021 fight and gunning for a rematch in the following years that would never come to fruition.</p><p>Four fights after losing to Davis, Cruz won his first world championship, stopping Rolly Romero to win the WBA title at 140 pounds. He would drop a split decision to Jose Valenzuela and lose the title in his next fight, but has since rebounded with back-to-back victories. In his most recent fight, Cruz won the interim title with a win over Omar Salcido.</p>\n<p>The winner will be in line for a title shot against Subriel Matias, who took a majority decision over Alberto Puello in July to win the belt.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span><strong> —</strong> Defense was supposed to be the fix. That was what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> chased all season. Last year, the team was buried -- second-to-last in the majors with 115 errors. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> had more, at 117. So <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184351/alex-bregman/\">Alex Bregman</a> was acquired, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165929/rafael-devers/\">Rafael Devers</a> was slid to DH, then eventually traded. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/\">Trevor Story</a> stayed healthy, which allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931004/ceddanne-rafaela/\">Ceddanne Rafaela</a> to be moved back to center, where a Gold Glove will likely be won.</p><p>By the numbers, Boston's outfield was rated the best in baseball, racking up 52 defensive runs saved. But defensive metrics can be tricky because the full story isn't told. They can be flawed. And if the Red Sox are watched long enough, their defensive flaws are seen, too.</p><p>So in Game 3 of the Wild Card, under the lights in the Bronx, mistakes piled up again. In a blink, the season was gone, sealed by a 4-0 loss. The rival Yankees scored all four runs in the fourth inning. </p><p>Red Sox rookie starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658250/connelly-early/\">Connelly Early</a> entered the top of the fourth inning with just 45 pitches, going toe-to-toe with fellow rookie Cam Schlittler, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/cam-schlittler-rewards-yankees-faith-with-unforgettable-12-strikeout-outing-that-ends-red-soxs-season/\" target=\"_blank\">who would eventually turn in eight scoreless frames and 12 strikeouts</a></span>. The most by a Yankee rookie in postseason history.</p>\n<p>\"We needed to be perfect tonight because he was perfect,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said after the game.</p><p>In a 0-0 game, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> worked the count to 3-2. On the sixth pitch of the at-bat, a fly ball was lofted to right-center field. It dropped in for a double, beginning a nose dive from which the Red Sox could not recover.</p>\n<p>\"I think Wilyer broke back, right, with a swing,\" added Cora. \"Just somebody, right? They have to make that play. With the swing, he didn't get a good jump and it just landed there. That's a play we make.\"</p>\n<p>Yet it was a play that Abreu sometimes struggled with.</p><p>The ball landed in short right-center, bouncing off the glove of the diving Rafaela. Abreu, indeed, broke back -- not for the first time. More on that later. A direct angle was had to the ball but he pulled up once Rafaela was seen.</p><p>\"That was a tough play,\" Abreu said. \"It was in between us. We were playing very far away so we couldn't get there.\"</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>Abreu, who won a Gold Glove last year, has often been guilty of over-committing. And it is done too soon. His internal clock has lacked feel and timing. While many balls are reached diagonally, going back or charging in has been a struggle. On this play, instead of patience and a proper read, a commitment backward was made immediately. The safe move, of course, is always to take a step back. Getting burned on a ball in is far worse -- a double over your head more times than not. But this has happened to Abreu way too often. Just look at the play last week against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a>, the final series of the season.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931997/parker-meadows/\">Parker Meadows</a> hit a weak fly ball off the end of the bat. A ball that should have been caught. But again, Abreu's aggressive commitment back allowed it to drop in for a single.</p><p>Then there is the Rafaela element. Typically, great reads and jumps are made, relying more on feel than calculation. The outfield is played like a cornerback in football -- freakish athletic ability with a knack for covering ground quickly.</p><p>But a banana route was taken this time. Almost in a semi-circle before the line was corrected. Neither of them called the ball.</p>\n<p>\"I just gave my all to catch that ball,\" Rafaela said. \"I saw that Willie didn't maybe have a chance, so I gave it my all to catch that ball.\"</p><p>Communication issues in the outfield plagued the Red Sox all season. And, in part, Rafaela was expected to catch everything.</p><p>Go back to the late August matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a>. A ball in left field should have been caught by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932710/jarren-duran/\">Jarren Duran</a>, but Rafaela was expected to take it, so it dropped between them.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox finished just outside the top 10 in DRS. The left side of the infield was shored up. Center field improved. And still, the majors were led in errors with 116 -- one more than last year. The final run-scoring play of the Red Sox season came on an error as first baseman Nathaniel Lowe botched a grounder off the bat of Ben Rice.</p><p>Those lapses are the reason the packing up is being done early, the team headed home as October begins.</p><p>\"Obviously, we should feel the way we feel right now, because we had bigger goals,\" Cora said. \"But when we have time to reflect on how we did things this year, this is what the Boston Red Sox are, it's a good group.\"</p>\n<p>Just not good enough in Game 3.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> had a chance to take down a division rival and move into sole possession of first place on Thursday night, but instead, they came up empty after making several huge mistakes during the late stages of their 26-23 overtime loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p><p>The Rams, who were favored by 8.5 points, became an upset victim because they couldn't get out of their own way in the fourth quarter. Although <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> threw for 389 yards and three touchdowns, it wasn't quite enough to overcome the Rams' costly errors. </p><p>Let's cover the three biggest errors that the Rams made from the fourth quarter and overtime. </p><h2>The Rams gave up another blocked kick</h2><p>The Rams trailed 20-7 in the third quarter, but thanks to Stafford, they were quickly able to erase that deficit. The Rams quarterback threw a touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> in the third quarter to cut the lead to 20-14. In the fourth quarter, it looked like the Rams were going to take a 21-20 lead after Kyren Wililams caught an 8-yard scoring pass, but that didn't happen, because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-kartys/\">Joshua Karty's</a> extra point got blocked. </p>\n<p>The block by the 49ers kept the score knotted at 20 with 10:39 left in the game. The Rams field goal team has had a serious problem with protection this year. This extra point attempt marked the third time since Week 3 that Karty has had a kick blocked and the painful part is that all three blocks have come in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Karty also missed a 53-yard field goal in the game, so special teams cost the Rams a total of four points. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a>' fumble in the fourth quarter</h2><p>With just 2:52 left to play and the Rams trailing 23-20, Los Angeles took over possession at its own 35-yard line with a chance to tie or win the game. </p>\n<p>Matthew Stafford quickly drove the Rams into scoring position on a drive where he completed two passes for 29 yards. After a 20-yard run from Kyren Williams, the Rams quickly found themselves on the cusp of scoring a possible go-ahead touchdown with a first-and-goal at San Francisco's 3-yard line. However, they ended up getting ZERO points on the drive because Williams fumbled the ball away at the 1-yard line. </p>\n<p>The fumble was forced by 49ers rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/\">Alfred Collins</a> who threw a perfect punch at the football to knock it loose. If Williams had scored a touchdown, it would have put the Rams up 27-23 with just 1:05 left to play, but instead, the 49ers took over possession at their own 1-yard line. </p><p>The Rams did force a three-and-out on the ensuing 49ers' drive and Stafford then quickly drove his team into field goal range to force overtime after Karty nailed a 48-yard kick. </p>\n<h2>Errant kickoff to start overtime </h2><p>Karty didn't get to celebrate his game-tying field goal for very long, because, on the first play of overtime, he made a brutal mistake. When Karty kicks off, he generally hits a knuckleball and that had been working well all night until the game got to overtime. In the extra session, Karty got penalized because his kickoff didn't make it to the landing zone. The penalty set the 49ers up with the ball at their 40-yard line. </p><p>From there, the 49ers didn't have to drive very far to get in field goal range. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> ended up taking them 37 yards to set up Eddy Pinero's 41-yard field goal that proved to be the game-winning points. </p><h2>Sean McVay admits his 'poor' play call cost his team the game</h2><p>Under this year's overtime rules, both teams are guaranteed one possession, so the 49ers had to kickoff to the Rams after Piniero's field goal. The Rams took over at their own 33-yard line and Stafford immediately drove them 56 yards down to San Francisco's 11-yard line, where they eventually faced a fourth-and-1. </p>\n<p>At that point, Rams coach Sean McVay had two options: He could kick the field and tie up the game or he could go for the first down. The usually conservative coach decided to go for it and that decision backfired after he called a run up the middle. </p>\n<p>Williams never had a chance. </p><p>After the game, McVay was asked about the play call and he was clearly frustrated with himself. </p><p>\"The play selection was very poor,\" McVay said. \"I'm sick right not because I put our players in a shitty spot and I have to live with that.\"</p>\n<p>Stafford was on fire in the fourth quarter and overtime, throwing for a total of 194 yards. The Rams had a six-play drive in overtime and the first five plays were all passes. With Stafford playing so well, it probably would have made sense to put the ball in his hands, but McVay had Williams run up the middle. </p><p>If you want our full takeaways from the 49ers win, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-vs-49ers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-as-san-francisco-surprisingly-controls-first-half/live/\" target=\"_blank\">we've got those here</a>. </p>\n            </div>",

Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Both teams feature a mix of proven star power and young talent. San Francisco's Christian McCaffrey and the Rams' Puka Nacua headline the NFL DFS player pool and can be rostered together in showdown DFS contests. Other players that will be popular NFL DFS picks include Mac Jones, Matthew Stafford, and Kyren Williams. Meanwhile potential NFL DFS values include Tutu Atwell, Demarcus Robinson and Marquez-Valdes Scantling.</p><p>How should they play into your NFL DFS strategy for 49ers vs. Rams, and which other daily Fantasy picks should be in your NFL DFS lineups?

He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including.

The former Stanford standout's 2024 season was hampered by injuries, limiting him to just four games in which he logged 50 carries for 202 rushing yards (4.0 average) and added 15 receptions for 146 receiving yards, but he did not score any touchdowns. In 2025 so far, across three games he's totaled 52 carries for 176 yards (a 3.4-yard average) and 25 catches for 213 yards, managing to find the end zone once as a receiver. </p><p>Over his career, McCaffrey has been widely recognized for his versatility and production: he's amassed over 6,500 rushing yards, 4,600 receiving yards, and more than 80 total touchdowns, while earning multiple Pro Bowl nods and winning the 2023 NFL Offensive Player of the Year award. When healthy, he's easily one of the most complete backs in the league, blending elite pass-catching skills with power and elusiveness out of the backfield. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-rams-vs-49ers-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-thursday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_TNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Play at Underdog Fantasy and get $100 in site credits after making a $5 wager</em></a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. The former BYU standout has quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most dangerous weapons at wide receiver. In 2024, despite missing time to injury, he still hauled in 79 receptions for 990 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 12.5 yards per catch. </p><p>In 2025, Nacua leads league with 29 catches for 333 yards and one touchdown. For his career, Nacua has earned significant accolades, including a Pro Bowl selection and Second-Team All-Pro honors in his rookie season, as well as setting NFL rookie records for receptions and receiving yardage. He's become known for his route-running precision and yards after catch ability. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-rams-vs-49ers-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-thursday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_TNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a>:</p><h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for 49ers vs. Rams</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday Night Football.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO</span> -- If you're not a white-knuckled partisan of either team -- chair arms firmly and punishingly clenched -- then the ninth inning of NL Wild Card Series Game 3 between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> is what you want out of playoff baseball. In the deciding game of the series, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-wild-card-2025-cubs-padres-game-3-live-updates-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">won 3-1 by the host Cubs</a>, the final inning provided intensity and drama worthy of October. It also merits revisiting as the Cubs prepare to duel with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Milwaukee Brewers</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/brewers-vs-cubs-nlds-schedule-prediction-odds-division-rivals-meet-for-first-time-in-mlb-playoffs/\" target=\"_blank\">in the Division Series</a></span> and the narrowly vanquished Padres begin their offseason. </p><p>It began with the Cubs up 3-0 and reliever <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/\">Brad Keller</a> on the mound for his second frame of work after not appearing in Wednesday's loss. Per basic win expectancy, the Cubs had a 96.8% chance of winning and closing out the series. Even before a pitch was thrown, it never felt that secure. </p><p>It certainly didn't after the third pitch was thrown, a low-and-inside 1-1 changeup from Keller that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26719676/jackson-merrill/\">Jackson Merrill</a> lashed for a home run to right-center and the Padres' first run of the game. This season, 14 of Merrill's 16 regular-season home runs came against right-handers like Keller. Counsell still had a lefty in the pen available, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2164751/taylor-rogers/\">Taylor Rogers</a> pitched in Game 2 and has generally struggled this season when working back-to-back days. </p>\n<p>The next crucial moment of the top of the ninth came with a full count on the next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945481/xander-bogaerts/\">Xander Bogaerts</a>. Keller placed a 3-2 fastball near the lower outside corner of the zone and catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044542/carson-kelly/\">Carson Kelly</a> snatch-framed it for a called strike three. Those watching via the magic of color-television saw it as an egregious miss on the part of plate ump D.J. Reyburn: </p>\n<p>\"Looked down to me,\" Padres manager Mike Shildt said after the game. \"You know, but I don't see great, and I am kind of far away. But most importantly, Bogey felt like he was down. He is not a guy -- you know, not any of our guys really, but Bogey in particular is not a guy that's overly dramatic about close pitches. It's a big pitch. It's a big swing pitch. You know, it turns the tying run and what would have unfolded after that could have been very impactful, but we had other opportunities, too.\"</p><p>Had this same pitch happened next year, Bogaerts surely would've tapped his helmet to challenge the pitch under the forthcoming ABS system. And just as surely it would've been ball four instead of strike three. Right? Maybe. However, Statcast graded the pitch as strike: </p><figure><p><img alt=\"bogaertspitch.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/03/4a1adeac-65af-4b67-9c64-c4e87e1e74d6/resize/670x377/6080b81958f203ee684b303254046025/bogaertspitch.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Baseball Savant\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>So maybe not, given that Statcast has better inputs than the K zone on your TV. The strike zone remains a many-splendored thing. The end result, though, is that the Padres instead of having the tying run at the plate with no outs had the bases empty and one out. For whatever it's worth, absent the fractured finger that sidelined him for this series, hot-hitting deadline addition Ramón Laureano probably would've batted in this spot. </p>\n<p>What happened next may have momentarily helped the Padres get past that potential missed call. Keller overcooked a 2-2 fastball and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211177/ryan-ohearn/\">Ryan O'Hearn</a>. Then a 1-2 changeup got away from him and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837044/bryce-johnson/\">Bryce Johnson</a>'s foot. That put the potential tying run on and thus brought the potential go-ahead run up in the person of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447496/jake-cronenworth/\">Jake Cronenworth</a>, and at that point Counsell went to right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2228478/andrew-kittredge/\">Andrew Kittredge</a>, who'd pitched in both Games 1 and 2 of the series. </p><p>That led to the next fraught moment of the inning: </p><p>The challenge was a worthy one given the moment, but Cronenworth was indeed out despite what seemed to be a brief hesitation on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153549/matt-shaw/\">Matt Shaw</a>'s part before making the throw across the diamond. The Padres, no doubt, were left wondering what if Bogaerts had gotten that call above and the bases had been loaded. Is Shaw positioned differently, so as to make the play easier or harder? Does he start a 5-4-3 instead? Or does the change in base-out state change the pitch selection and thus the batted-ball outcome altogether? Unknowns abound, except in reality where it was two on two out and a two-run margin. </p><p>With the game on the line, Freddy Fermín put a good swing on a first-pitch sinker from Kitteredge but got just a bit under it. He hit hard, but the high launch angle made it peter out at 354 feet and into the able glove of Cubs center fielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>. Like Cronenworth's batted ball, Fermin's had an expected batting average of just .170, and again the Padres were on the short end of the odds. </p>\n<p>As it was in the ninth, it was for the series from the San Diego standpoint -- just the wrong angle, the wrong bounce, the wrong flip of the coin. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>In concept, a ball is the most procedural aspect of the World Cup, arguably the single greatest reminder that no matter how grandiose the world's most popular sporting event can be, soccer's trademark is its inherent simplicity. The sport's reputation is rooted in the fact that, in theory, all a group of people needs is a single, round piece of equipment to enjoy a kickabout. Not all soccer balls are created equal, though, and that is especially true for World Cup balls.</p><p>Enter the Trionda, Adidas' official match ball for the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Like previous World Cup balls, it looks the part, the name and design are a reflection of the region that will host the 48-team tournament. \"Tri\" stands for the three host nations, represented by three colors – blue for the U.S., red for Canada and green for Mexico – while its curved pattern is a nod to \"onda,\" the Spanish word for wave or vibe. The Trionda's most unique aspects, though, lie in the invisible elements and its years-long journey to the ball's unveiling on Thursday at Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p><p>\"The World Cups are all unique so the balls are also very unique each time.,\" Solene Stormann, Adidas' global category director of football hardware said in an interview with CBS Sports.</p><p>While Adidas has some tried-and-true processes in bringing an official match ball to life, the Trionda went through several rounds of innovation and testing before it was the finished product. In the end, the Trionda is a uniquely custom product, one Adidas and FIFA will hope will stay as invisible as the details that went into its creation by the time the first ball is kicked for the opening game at Mexico City's Estadio Azteca on June 11.</p>\n<h2>Humidity, AI chip taken into consideration</h2><p>The Trionda is the first official match ball to be designed with a specific climate in mind – or to be more specific, several climates. The 2026 World Cup will take place across 16 host cities as far north as Vancouver, Canada and as far south as Mexico City, each with their own distinct weather patterns in June and July. Adidas took all of that into consideration when designing the Trionda, giving the ball a texture with an extra grip to ensure it feels the same at the players' feet regardless of venue.</p><p>\"We know that we have 16 host cities and we wanted to ensure that this ball works everywhere so we wanted to check on what are the differences in terms of the locations,\" Stormann said. \"We know they have different humidity levels, different altitude levels, different temperature, different weather so we wanted to test against those criteria and make sure this ball works.\"</p><p>Adidas first tested the Trionda's ability to perform at different humidity levels in a controlled space before taking it on the road to seven of the 16 World Cup host cities. There, players from the likes of MLS' Vancouver Whitecaps and Liga MX's Tigres got to try the product themselves as part of the brand's testing process.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor Al Rihla, the official match ball for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the Trionda will also have a chip powered by AI, though a few elements are different. The chip will now be lodged in the side of the ball rather than its more central placement four years earlier, its Ai-powered system designed to provide several real-time insights and data for the future. The expectation is that the system will allow referees to make more accurate – and faster – decisions, while the takeaways from the 2026 World Cup will help inform Adidas on their next innovations. The game's tactical evolution over the years makes previous match balls feel out of date at the feet of modern-day professionals, so Adidas pays just as much attention to those statistics as coaches and analysts as they prepare for what's next.</p><p>\"If you look at certain [key performance indicators] in football – the amount of passes, the amount of high-speed running, the amount of sprints throughout the game, all these things are increasing,\" Hannes Schaefke, Adidas' football innovation lead, said. \"From a technological perspective, in performance tracking, the ball was sort of the last frontier because it was super hard to track this from an optical standpoint, almost impossible. Some things like touch frequency during a dribble, you [could] never track that without a sensor inside so this is where I think, from an understanding of the game, the depth of how well you understand it and anticipate the future of it, is where having all tracking unlocked is a huge, huge promise for the future.\"</p><h2>'The most tested ball we've ever had'</h2><p>To some degree, Adidas has a blank canvas when designing official match balls because the variables are constantly changing, refreshing the need for several rounds of testing time and time again.</p>\n<p>Those trials have become especially noteworthy since 2010, when the Jabulani used in South Africa was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/sports/soccer/04ball.html\">described as a \"disaster\" and resembled \"a beach ball\"</a> by goalkeepers who took part in the competition. That ball, as well as the Telstar 18 used in Russia during the 2018 World Cup, received complaints for being hard to control, the trajectory of the ball becoming unpredictable in the process. It is no wonder, then, that several design elements are earmarked for performance. The Trionda, for instance, is stitched together from four fluid panels while Al Rihla was comprised of 20 geometric panels, a change that plays a much bigger role than aesthetics.</p><p>\"We also see that the panel shape as well as the different groove lines that we applied onto the outer shell … has an influence on the aerodynamics,\" Stormann said. \" it's not about the amount of panels that dictate if it's performing well or not, it's more about the combination of the panel with its seam length and the debossing lines, how they are actually assorted around the ball, how they are homogeneously placed so that has actually [an] influence on all the aerodynamic criteria.\"</p><p>The complaints about the Jabulani and the Telstar 18 only make the aerodynamics more important, so it's no wonder why so much of the testing process is dedicated to that aspect of performance.</p>\n<p>\"At Adidas, in-house, we have our own lab where we do, for instance, robo-like testing but we also work with external partners like the Loughborough University. They do wind-tunnel tests so this is all very scientific but here, we can already check against those aerodynamic criteria like in-flight stability, the launch speed, the in-flight speed, the swerve, precision.\"</p><p>From there, the ball faces its most crucial test – the players.</p><p>\"We also want to validate it through the players because they also have a perceived way of seeing if it performs for them or not so we also go out there and test this with amateur players [up] until pro players to also get their feedback and validation,\" Stormann said.</p><p>The ultimate trials, though, will come in the weeks and months before the World Cup. Some competitions will have access to the Trionda fairly early depending on the nature of their contracts, while national teams competing at the World Cup will have the chance to work with the ball – at least during training sessions – three to four months before next summer's tournament. Time will tell which of its predecessors the Trionda will follow – the ones that became the story or the ones that truly represented soccer's inherent simplicity, serving as an essential but silent participant in the show.</p>\n            </div>",

One week after an NFC West clash between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> went to overtime, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a> held off the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> in an overtime thriller of their own. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a> was stopped on a fourth-and-1 at the 49ers' 1-yard line in overtime to seal the win for San Francisco. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3175295/marques-sigle/\">Marques Sigle</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867301/deommodore-lenoir/\">Deommodore Lenoir</a> combined to make that sensational game-ending tackle on a night that the 49ers were without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818265/george-kittle/\">George Kittle</a>, Juwan Jennings, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122949/ricky-pearsall/\">Ricky Pearsall</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967489/brandon-aiyuk/\">Brandon Aiyuk</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260972/nick-bosa/\">Nick Bosa</a>. </p><p>The 49ers improve to 4-1 and take over the NFC West lead (the Seahawks play later in Week 5) while the Rams fall to 3-2. There are plenty of overreactions to digest from this one. Which are really overreactions and which of them are reality? </p><h2>Rams lost NFC West thanks to Kyren Williams' fumble</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>There will be plenty of opportunities for the Rams to win a division that likely won't be decided until the final week of the regular season, especially given that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> is the quarterback in Los Angeles. But let's talk about Williams' fumble at the 1-yard line. </p>\n<p>The Rams were trailing 23-20 with 1:07 left and had a first-and-goal at the 3-yard line. Williams got the ball and tried to get into the end zone, but he had the ball punched out and the 49ers recovered the fumble. The giveaway cost the Rams' the lead and the opportunity to win the contest in regulation, changing the entire trajectory of the game.</p><p>Even with Williams' blunder, the Rams still earned another possession in the final minute and forced overtime after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-karty/\">Joshua Karty</a> field goal. The defense held the 49ers to three points on their overtime possession, so a touchdown by Stafford and the offense would have won the game for Los Angeles. </p><p>But the offense couldn't get a yard in overtime on fourth-and-1 at the 49ers' 11, passing on a field goal opportunity that would've tied the game with 3:41 left. Williams couldn't get the yard as the offensive line didn't give him enough of a hole for the required gain. </p>\n<p>The Rams didn't lose the division because of that Williams fumble, and they still had plenty of opportunities after that to win the game. They also have only played one division game so far, but those late blunders cost them.</p><p>There were plenty of miscues to go around. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> should start for the 49ers for another month</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality </p><p>The 49ers rushed Brock Purdy back too soon, as he aggravated the turf toe injury that sidelined him for two weeks. While it's unclear how long Purdy will be out this time around, Jones has shined filling in for Purdy. He finished 33 of 49 for 342 yards with two touchdowns to zero interceptions for a 100.9 passer rating in the win -- thriving on a short week. </p><p>The 49ers are 3-0 in Jones' starts this seaosn, as Jones has completed 66.7% of his passes for 905 yards with six touchdowns to an interception (99.1 rating). Jones has managed the game and protected the football, which is all the 49ers can ask. He's okay on throws of 10+ air yards and third and fourth down, but the 49ers aren't putting too much on his plate -- which is working for an offense down several starters. </p>\n<p>This doesn't mean Purdy should get benched, but the 49ers shouldn't rush him back. Let Purdy get to 100% and ride with Jones for a few more games. He can get the job done for another month. </p><h2>Rams should go to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3169252/blake-corum/\">Blake Corum</a> in the red zone</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>As good as Kyren Williams is as a No. 1 running back, the Rams may need to go to a tougher runner in Corum to get the job done. Corum has been electric as a No. 2 running back this season, having 24 carries for 133 yards and a touchdown (5.5 yards per carry).</p><p>Why should Corum be considered over Williams? Ball security, as Williams has seven lost fumbles since the start of the 2023 season -- the most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. Williams had six fumbles last season (including the postseason) and already has two fumbles this season. He also was stopped on the fourth-and-1 play at the 11-yard line, and the Rams could've used that extra leg strength Corum likely would have been able to give the Rams there. </p>\n<p>Williams is a good running back, but his fumbles are costing the Rams. Perhaps going to Corum in the red zone will allow them to finish drives. </p><h2>Sean McVay should have kicked a field goal instead of going for it on 4th-and-1</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction </p><p>Hindsight is always 20-20, especially when the play fails. McVay wasn't going to give the 49ers the ball back for a third possession with 3:41 left in overtime when his team needed just one yard at the 49ers' 11-yard line. The Rams have Matthew Stafford at quarterback, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893167/davante-adams/\">Davante Adams</a> at wide receiver, yet they went for a short-yardage run with Kyren Williams. </p><p>The offensive line did not block for Williams and the Rams didn't get the yard, but perhaps McVay should have put the ball in Stafford's hands and rely on his arm to get the first down and win the game. Again, hindsight is 20-20.</p>\n<p>Kicking a field goal would have extended the game, but the Rams likely wouldn't have had enough time to win the game if they did stop the 49ers a second time -- or the 49ers kick a field goal on their second possession and win it in overtime in the final seconds.</p><p>Going for it was the right decision. The issue is that McVay and the Rams offense just didn't execute.  </p><h2>49ers will end up as No. 1 seed in NFC </h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>It's hard not to be impressed with the 49ers through five games, picking up three wins with a backup quarterback and starting 4-1 with all the injuries that they've had over the first month of the season. George Kittle. Ricky Pearsall and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/\">Jauan Jennings</a> will be back soon, so reinforcements are coming for an offense that hasn't really missed a beat in their absence.</p>\n<p>There's a lot to like with the 49ers right now, but are they going to end up as the top seed in the NFC come January? The schedule certainly favors them as San Francisco plays just two teams currently over. 500 until its bye week in Week 14! The 49ers are going to be in the mix for the top seed, and they are already 3-0 in the division -- with wins at Seattle and Los Angeles! </p><p>While it's too early to crown the 49ers as the No. 1 seed through five weeks, the odds are shifting in their favor to getting that top seed with their schedule and how they've been playing. If the 49ers can get healthy -- and not lose <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136743/christian-mccaffrey/\">Christian McCaffrey</a> to injury -- they have just a good a chance as any team in the NFC to get that top seed. </p><p>San Francisco is in the mix. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Just when you thought players on byes were all you had to worry about when making Week 5 Fantasy football picks, the injury bug struck in a big way. Malik Nabers and Tyreek Hill are done for the year, while Lamar Jackson (hamstring) will reportedly miss at least two weeks. Trey Benson was also placed on IR, while Bucky Irving could be a game-time decision. This all throws a wrench into the Fantasy football strategy for their owners, while those players on byes affects just about everyone setting Week 5 Fantasy football lineups.</p><p>With those wideout injuries, plus the likes of Drake London, D.J. Moore and Romeo Doubs on byes, can you continue to rely on the likes of Quentin Johnston, Tre Tucker and Michael Pittman Jr.? They are all in the top 15 of positional Fantasy football rankings, while bigger-named wideouts like Calvin Ridley, Jerry Jeudy and Cooper Kupp sit outside the top 50. With everything going on, your Fantasy football start/sit decisions will likely be tougher for Week 5 Fantasy football lineups than for any other week thus far. Before making your Week 5 Fantasy football picks, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-nfl-week-5-projections-from-proven-model-that-outperformed-experts/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_Week5FFrankings\" target=\"_blank\">check out the Week 5 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Bet on every NFL Week 5 game at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users can target the </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><p>When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.</p><p>Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 5 of the 2025 NFL season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-nfl-week-5-projections-from-proven-model-that-outperformed-experts/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_Week5FFrankings\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>Top Week 5 Fantasy football picks </h2><p>One surprise in Week 5: The model is fading Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith, a two-time 1,000-yard wideout who has been a top-30 Fantasy receiver each of the last three years. Much has been made about A.J. Brown's lack of involvement in Philly's offense, but Smith has been just as much as a non-factor. He's had 60 or fewer receiving yards in every game this season and has just one touchdown. He's averaging just five targets per game and is coming off a two-catch, 29-yard performance versus Tampa.</p><p>Smith has eight fewer targets than Brown this year, and dating back to last season's playoffs, Smith hasn't reached 70 yards in eight straight games. In Week 5, he'll face a top-10 passing defense in the Broncos, who have also allowed the fewest passing touchdowns (one) in the NFL. Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins combined for just 55 yards versus Denver on Monday night, and only one wideout all year has eclipsed 68 receiving yards against the Broncos. Thus, Smith may not warrant a spot in Week 5 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in positional rankings.</p><p>Another curveball: The model is high on Colts quarterback Daniel Jones. The former Giant has four passing and three rushing touchdowns on the season as he enters Week 5 as the QB8 in Fantasy points. He may be even higher if Colts wideout, Adonai Mitchell, wouldn't have fumbled on the 1-yard-line on Sunday with a premature celebration, taking away another potential passing score for Jones. The quarterback is among many who have found success after leaving New York, as Jones has career highs in passer rating, yards per game and completion percentage.</p><p>The Raiders' defense awaits Indy in Week 5, and Vegas has a bottom-10 pass defense on the season. All four quarterbacks the Raiders have faced have at least 200 passing yards and a passing score, so there's a high Fantasy floor whenever playing Las Vegas. Additionally, just seven teams have allowed more rushing yards to opposing quarterbacks than Vegas, which plays into one of Jones' strengths. He checks in as a top-three Fantasy QB for Week 5, slotting ahead the likes of Patrick Mahomes and Dak Prescott.

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> were the deserving AL East champ in the regular season and it was their first division title since 2015. They had the same 94-68 record as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> -- tied for the best record in the AL -- but won the division based on winning the season series, eight games to five. </p><p>With that tiebreaker came the bye. The Jays rested up this past week while the Yankees had to battle the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> in a tough three-game series in the Bronx. They prevailed, though, and we get to see a Yankees-Blue Jays playoff series. If that sounds rare to you, it is. In fact, this is the first-ever playoff meeting between the two AL East foes.</p><h2>Yankees vs. Blue Jays schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time</th><th>TV</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sat., Oct. 4</p></td><td><p>4:08 pm ET</p></td><td><p>FOX</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sun., Oct. 5</p></td><td><p>4:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>FOX</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 3</strong></td><td>Tues., Oct. 7</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 4 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Wed., Oct. 8</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 5 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Fri., Oct. 10</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Yankees vs. Blue Jays: Game 1 info</h2><ul><li><strong>Time</strong>: 4:08 p.m. ET | <strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Rogers Centre -- Toronto</li><li><strong>TV channel</strong>: FOX | <strong>Live stream</strong>: Fubo.tv</li><li><strong>Starting pitchers</strong>: TBD</li><li><strong>Odds</strong>: Yankees +104, Blue Jays -122 | O/U: 7.5</li></ul><h2>Game 1 storylines</h2><p><strong>Yankees</strong>: The Yankees will look to avoid using their bullpen as much as they can and that's the area for opponents to exploit.

The Yankees have a ton of offensive firepower, but only scored nine runs in three games with two homers in the first round. They'll be looking to bust loose here.</p><p><strong>Blue Jays</strong>: The Blue Jays have the advantage in this one due to getting to start whichever pitcher they want while the Yankees have to use their No. 4 starter.

NFL player props figure to center on big names like Matthew Stafford, Christian McCaffrey, Kyren Williams and Puka Nacua, but you may be able to find value with NFL prop lines for under-the-radar players. Brian Robinson Jr. has had a consistent role as McCaffrey's backup with at least 20 rushing yards in each game. His Thursday Night Football props for rushing have a bar of just 19.5, with NFL prop odds of -114 for the Over.</p><p>With the Rams' defense second in the league with 14 sacks -- and with San Fran ruling out Brock Purdy (toe) and some key receivers -- the Niners may lean more on the run on TNF. McCaffrey leads the NFL in touches (100), and given the short week, San Francisco may call upon Robinson more than usual, making his NFL prop bet one to consider. Other rushing yard NFL prop totals include 59.5 for McCaffrey and 67.5 for Williams.

Stafford is averaging 278.5 passing yards on the season as he ranks second in passing yards entering Week 5. He's had at least 245 yards in three of four starts, in addition to having at least 243 passing yards in six of his last seven home starts dating back to last year's regular season.</p><p>Stafford should have little deterrence from San Fran's defense, as the Niners' current 11-game streak without an interception is tied for the longest by any NFL team since 1940. With Nick Bosa (knee) out for the year, the 49ers had zero sacks last week, and a lack of pass rush will allow wideouts like Nacua and Davante Adams to run free in the secondary. The model projects Stafford to have 281.4 passing yards, giving this prop bet a 4.5-star rating. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/prop-picks/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_AImodel_Rams49ersAIprops\" target=\"_blank\">See more NFL props here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to make NFL player prop bets for Rams vs. 49ers</h2><p>In addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has 13 additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/prop-picks/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_AImodel_Rams49ersAIprops\" target=\"_blank\">You need to see the Machine Learning Model analysis before making any 49ers vs. Rams prop bets for Thursday Night Football</a>.</p><p><strong>Which Rams vs. 49ers prop bets should you target for Thursday Night Football? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251002_SF@LAR/prop-picks/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_AImodel_Rams49ersAIprops\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see the top 49ers vs. Rams props, all from the SportsLine Machine Learning Model</a>.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

Now, however, the league's appeal to rehear the decision has been denied. The NFL can appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the Supreme Court hears very few cases per year. The NFL had hoped that this lawsuit would go to arbitration to avoid potentially damning details becoming public, but it is rapidly running out of options. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/someone-will-give-him-a-chance-why-jon-grudens-desire-to-coach-college-football-shouldnt-be-ignored/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>'Someone will give him a chance:' Why Jon Gruden's desire to coach college football shouldn't be ignored</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brandon Marcello                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"'Someone will give him a chance:' Why Jon Gruden's desire to coach college football shouldn't be ignored\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/15/82e51ea6-4ad1-4172-96b5-c9f6c28c64cc/thumbnail/270x152/b654f175e382cbe120f2c86bb6c7a892/jon-gruden.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal first uncovered a 2011 email between Gruden and then-Washington team president Bruce Allen in which Gruden <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nflpa-raiders-investigating-jon-gruden-regarding-use-of-racist-remark-about-demaurice-smith-in-2011-email/\" target=\"_blank\">used a racist trope</a> when discussing then-NFLPA president DeMaurice Smith, who is Black.

The Bills look to move to 5-0 on the season and, if they do, can grab a three-game lead within the division. Buffalo is an 8.5-point favorite over the Patriots (2-2). In other games involving AFC East foes, the Dolphins (1-3) are 1.5-point favorites against the Panthers (1-3) at Carolina, while the Jets (0-4) are 2.5-point underdogs against the visiting Cowboys (1-2-1) in the latest Week 5 NFL odds. The week kicks off with 49ers vs. Rams (-8.5) on 'Thursday Night Football' as Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings are among the key players out for the Niners.

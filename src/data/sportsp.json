Purdy is the most notable injury, but even as Mac Jones steps in after going 2-0 as a starter this season, he'll be without two key playmakers who aided him in those victories with Jauan Jennings﻿﻿﻿ (ankle/ribs) and Ricky Pearsall﻿﻿﻿ (knee) both out. The 49ers remain without Brandon Aiyuk, who has been on IR all season with a knee injury, leaving Jones with limited options. San Francisco defeated the Saints and Cardinals in one-score victories with Jones, and a road matchup against the 3-1 Rams will be a significantly tougher challenge. The Rams are a blocked field goal away from a 4-0 start as well, and as the significantly healthier team, the model favors Los Angeles for a more comfortable victory. The model projects the Rams to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>New Mexico State (+114) to defeat Sam Houston</h2><p>The home team has won each of their two meetings over the last two seasons, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Thursday. New Mexico State defeated Sam Houston, 27-13, in 2023 before falling in this matchup, 31-11, in Texas last year. But Sam Houston is off to an 0-4 start this season, while New Mexico State is 2-2. New Mexico State is one of the most pass-heavy teams in the nation, and the unit can capitalize on Sam Houston's weaknesses with the strategy. Sam Houston ranks 131st of 136 teams in passing yards allowed (321.8 yards per game), while ranking 127th in completion percentage against (70.34%). New Mexico is 28th in the nation in passing yards (274 per game) behind fifth-year quarterback Logan Fife. The Aggies have three different receivers with more than 200 yards this season as well. The model projects an upset on Thursday, with New Mexico State winning in 54% of simulations, projecting strong value at plus-money odds.</p><h2>Yankees (-158) to defeat the Red Sox</h2><p>The Yankees were one of the hottest teams in baseball to close the regular season, winning eight straight games and 11 of 12 contests to finish 94-68 on the season. New York finished five games ahead of Boston (89-73) this season, behind the No. 1 offense in baseball (5.21 runs per game). Aaron Judge, the favorite to win the AL MVP, is 4-for-8 this postseason after leading baseball in categories such as batting average (.331) and OPS (1.144). Although both the Yankees and Red Sox are starting rookies, New York has the experience advantage on the mound with Connelly Early, 23, making just his fifth career start for Boston. Yankees starter Cam Schlittler, 24, went 4-3 with a 2.96 ERA in 14 starts this year. New York went 50-31 at Yankee Stadium, while Boston was just 41-40 away from Fenway Park. The model expects the Yankees to take advantage of homefield advantage, projecting New York to win in 65% of simulations. </p><h2>Want more MLB picks and Thursday Night Football picks for Thursday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> had a chance to take down a division rival and move into sole possession of first place on Thursday night, but instead, they came up empty after making several huge mistakes during the late stages of their 26-23 overtime loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p><p>The Rams, who were favored by 8.5 points, became an upset victim because they couldn't get out of their own way in the fourth quarter. Although <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> threw for 389 yards and three touchdowns, it wasn't quite enough to overcome the Rams' costly errors. </p><p>Let's cover the three biggest errors that the Rams made from the fourth quarter and overtime. </p><h2>The Rams gave up another blocked kick</h2><p>The Rams trailed 20-7 in the third quarter, but thanks to Stafford, they were quickly able to erase that deficit. The Rams quarterback threw a touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> in the third quarter to cut the lead to 20-14. In the fourth quarter, it looked like the Rams were going to take a 21-20 lead after Kyren Wililams caught an 8-yard scoring pass, but that didn't happen, because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-kartys/\">Joshua Karty's</a> extra point got blocked. </p>\n<p>The block by the 49ers kept the score knotted at 20 with 10:39 left in the game. The Rams field goal team has had a serious problem with protection this year. This extra point attempt marked the third time since Week 3 that Karty has had a kick blocked and the painful part is that all three blocks have come in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Karty also missed a 53-yard field goal in the game, so special teams cost the Rams a total of four points. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a>' fumble in the fourth quarter</h2><p>With just 2:52 left to play and the Rams trailing 23-20, Los Angeles took over possession at its own 35-yard line with a chance to tie or win the game. </p>\n<p>Matthew Stafford quickly drove the Rams into scoring position on a drive where he completed two passes for 29 yards. After a 20-yard run from Kyren Williams, the Rams quickly found themselves on the cusp of scoring a possible go-ahead touchdown with a first-and-goal at San Francisco's 3-yard line. However, they ended up getting ZERO points on the drive because Williams fumbled the ball away at the 1-yard line. </p>\n<p>The fumble was forced by 49ers rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/\">Alfred Collins</a> who threw a perfect punch at the football to knock it loose. If Williams had scored a touchdown, it would have put the Rams up 27-23 with just 1:05 left to play, but instead, the 49ers took over possession at their own 1-yard line. </p><p>The Rams did force a three-and-out on the ensuing 49ers' drive and Stafford then quickly drove his team into field goal range to force overtime after Karty nailed a 48-yard kick. </p>\n<h2>Errant kickoff to start overtime </h2><p>Karty didn't get to celebrate his game-tying field goal for very long, because, on the first play of overtime, he made a brutal mistake. When Karty kicks off, he generally hits a knuckleball and that had been working well all night until the game got to overtime. In the extra session, Karty got penalized because his kickoff didn't make it to the landing zone. The penalty set the 49ers up with the ball at their 40-yard line. </p><p>From there, the 49ers didn't have to drive very far to get in field goal range. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> ended up taking them 37 yards to set up Eddy Pinero's 41-yard field goal that proved to be the game-winning points. </p><h2>Sean McVay admits his 'poor' play call cost his team the game</h2><p>Under this year's overtime rules, both teams are guaranteed one possession, so the 49ers had to kickoff to the Rams after Piniero's field goal. The Rams took over at their own 33-yard line and Stafford immediately drove them 56 yards down to San Francisco's 11-yard line, where they eventually faced a fourth-and-1. </p>\n<p>At that point, Rams coach Sean McVay had two options: He could kick the field and tie up the game or he could go for the first down. The usually conservative coach decided to go for it and that decision backfired after he called a run up the middle. </p>\n<p>Williams never had a chance. </p><p>After the game, McVay was asked about the play call and he was clearly frustrated with himself. </p><p>\"The play selection was very poor,\" McVay said. \"I'm sick right not because I put our players in a shitty spot and I have to live with that.\"</p>\n<p>Stafford was on fire in the fourth quarter and overtime, throwing for a total of 194 yards. The Rams had a six-play drive in overtime and the first five plays were all passes. With Stafford playing so well, it probably would have made sense to put the ball in his hands, but McVay had Williams run up the middle. </p><p>If you want our full takeaways from the 49ers win, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-vs-49ers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-as-san-francisco-surprisingly-controls-first-half/live/\" target=\"_blank\">we've got those here</a>. </p>\n            </div>",

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> were the deserving AL East champ in the regular season and it was their first division title since 2015. They had the same 94-68 record as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> -- tied for the best record in the AL -- but won the division based on winning the season series, eight games to five. </p><p>With that tiebreaker came the bye. The Jays rested up this past week while the Yankees had to battle the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> in a tough three-game series in the Bronx. They prevailed, though, and we get to see a Yankees-Blue Jays playoff series. If that sounds rare to you, it is. In fact, this is the first-ever playoff meeting between the two AL East foes.</p><h2>Yankees vs. Blue Jays schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time</th><th>TV</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sat., Oct. 4</p></td><td><p>4:08 pm ET</p></td><td><p>FOX</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sun., Oct. 5</p></td><td><p>4:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>FOX</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 3</strong></td><td>Tues., Oct. 7</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 4 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Wed., Oct. 8</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 5 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Fri., Oct. 10</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Yankees vs. Blue Jays: Game 1 info</h2><ul><li><strong>Time</strong>: 4:08 p.m. ET | <strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Rogers Centre -- Toronto</li><li><strong>TV channel</strong>: FOX | <strong>Live stream</strong>: Fubo.tv</li><li><strong>Starting pitchers</strong>: TBD</li><li><strong>Odds</strong>: Yankees +104, Blue Jays -122 | O/U: 7.5</li></ul><h2>Game 1 storylines</h2><p><strong>Yankees</strong>: The Yankees will look to avoid using their bullpen as much as they can and that's the area for opponents to exploit.

The Yankees have a ton of offensive firepower, but only scored nine runs in three games with two homers in the first round. They'll be looking to bust loose here.</p><p><strong>Blue Jays</strong>: The Blue Jays have the advantage in this one due to getting to start whichever pitcher they want while the Yankees have to use their No. 4 starter. The high-powered Blue Jays offense led the AL in batting average and on-base percentage in the regular season and will look to take advantage.</p>\n<h2>Series odds, prediction</h2><ul><li><strong>Series odds</strong> (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>): Yankees -156 | Blue Jays +132</li></ul><p>The Yankees have better starting pitching once we get past Game 1.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span><strong> —</strong> Defense was supposed to be the fix. That was what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> chased all season. Last year, the team was buried -- second-to-last in the majors with 115 errors. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> had more, at 117. So <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184351/alex-bregman/\">Alex Bregman</a> was acquired, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165929/rafael-devers/\">Rafael Devers</a> was slid to DH, then eventually traded. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/\">Trevor Story</a> stayed healthy, which allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931004/ceddanne-rafaela/\">Ceddanne Rafaela</a> to be moved back to center, where a Gold Glove will likely be won.</p><p>By the numbers, Boston's outfield was rated the best in baseball, racking up 52 defensive runs saved. But defensive metrics can be tricky because the full story isn't told. They can be flawed. And if the Red Sox are watched long enough, their defensive flaws are seen, too.</p><p>So in Game 3 of the Wild Card, under the lights in the Bronx, mistakes piled up again. In a blink, the season was gone, sealed by a 4-0 loss. The rival Yankees scored all four runs in the fourth inning. </p><p>Red Sox rookie starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658250/connelly-early/\">Connelly Early</a> entered the top of the fourth inning with just 45 pitches, going toe-to-toe with fellow rookie Cam Schlittler, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/cam-schlittler-rewards-yankees-faith-with-unforgettable-12-strikeout-outing-that-ends-red-soxs-season/\" target=\"_blank\">who would eventually turn in eight scoreless frames and 12 strikeouts</a></span>. The most by a Yankee rookie in postseason history.</p>\n<p>\"We needed to be perfect tonight because he was perfect,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said after the game.</p><p>In a 0-0 game, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> worked the count to 3-2. On the sixth pitch of the at-bat, a fly ball was lofted to right-center field. It dropped in for a double, beginning a nose dive from which the Red Sox could not recover.</p>\n<p>\"I think Wilyer broke back, right, with a swing,\" added Cora. \"Just somebody, right? They have to make that play. With the swing, he didn't get a good jump and it just landed there. That's a play we make.\"</p>\n<p>Yet it was a play that Abreu sometimes struggled with.</p><p>The ball landed in short right-center, bouncing off the glove of the diving Rafaela. Abreu, indeed, broke back -- not for the first time. More on that later. A direct angle was had to the ball but he pulled up once Rafaela was seen.</p><p>\"That was a tough play,\" Abreu said. \"It was in between us. We were playing very far away so we couldn't get there.\"</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>Abreu, who won a Gold Glove last year, has often been guilty of over-committing. And it is done too soon. His internal clock has lacked feel and timing. While many balls are reached diagonally, going back or charging in has been a struggle. On this play, instead of patience and a proper read, a commitment backward was made immediately. The safe move, of course, is always to take a step back. Getting burned on a ball in is far worse -- a double over your head more times than not. But this has happened to Abreu way too often. Just look at the play last week against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a>, the final series of the season.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931997/parker-meadows/\">Parker Meadows</a> hit a weak fly ball off the end of the bat. A ball that should have been caught. But again, Abreu's aggressive commitment back allowed it to drop in for a single.</p><p>Then there is the Rafaela element. Typically, great reads and jumps are made, relying more on feel than calculation. The outfield is played like a cornerback in football -- freakish athletic ability with a knack for covering ground quickly.</p><p>But a banana route was taken this time. Almost in a semi-circle before the line was corrected. Neither of them called the ball.</p>\n<p>\"I just gave my all to catch that ball,\" Rafaela said. \"I saw that Willie didn't maybe have a chance, so I gave it my all to catch that ball.\"</p><p>Communication issues in the outfield plagued the Red Sox all season. And, in part, Rafaela was expected to catch everything.</p><p>Go back to the late August matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a>. A ball in left field should have been caught by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932710/jarren-duran/\">Jarren Duran</a>, but Rafaela was expected to take it, so it dropped between them.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox finished just outside the top 10 in DRS. The left side of the infield was shored up. Center field improved. And still, the majors were led in errors with 116 -- one more than last year. The final run-scoring play of the Red Sox season came on an error as first baseman Nathaniel Lowe botched a grounder off the bat of Ben Rice.</p><p>Those lapses are the reason the packing up is being done early, the team headed home as October begins.</p><p>\"Obviously, we should feel the way we feel right now, because we had bigger goals,\" Cora said. \"But when we have time to reflect on how we did things this year, this is what the Boston Red Sox are, it's a good group.\"</p>\n<p>Just not good enough in Game 3.</p>\n            </div>",

    "description": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span> -- The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> were so ",
    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span> -- The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> were so confident in rookie righty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29087628/cam-schlittler/\">Cam Schlittler</a> that not only did they not add a starting pitcher at the trade deadline, they subtracted one. New York released veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001082/marcus-stroman/\">Marcus Stroman</a> the day after the deadline and went all-in on Schlittler as their No. 5 starter the rest of the season and, potentially, into October.  </p><p>Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, Schlittler rewarded the team's faith and then some.  </p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/yankees-vs-red-sox-score-cam-schlittler-leads-new-york-past-rivals-into-alds/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Schlittler's eight shutout innings</a>, the Yankees are heading to Toronto for the ALDS after beating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> in Game 3 of the Wild Card Series (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20251002_BOS@NYY/\" target=\"_blank\">NYY 4, BOS 0</a>). The Yankees are the first team since the 12-team postseason format was implemented in 2022 to come back to win the best-of-three Wild Card Series after dropping Game 1.</p><p>\"Every time he has taken the ball, I feel so good about him that he's capable of the play because he is such a good strike thrower and with that stuff,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after Game 3.  </p>\n<p>Schlittler, a seventh-round pick in 2022, is a lanky 6-foot-6, and he sat right around 90 mph during his three years at Northeastern. Even this April, he was sitting 94-95 mph in Double-A. On Thursday, Schlittler hit 100 mph 25 times and averaged -- <em>averaged</em> -- 98.9 mph with his fastball. His rise can best be described as meteoric.</p><p>\"The  interesting thing about him is he wasn't always this kind of guy,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29086560/ben-rice/\">Ben Rice</a>, who caught Schlittler in the minors, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/how-yankees-rookie-cam-schlittler-has-helped-stabilize-the-injury-ravaged-starting-rotation/\" target=\"_blank\">said in August</a></span>. \"I remember the year he got  drafted, he started in extended  spring training. He was not a velocity  guy by any means. To his credit,  he put in the work, put his head down,  put on weight, put on muscle. He  made himself into a really good  pitcher.\"  </p><p>Not only was Schlittler electric Thursday, but he was a bad matchup for a Red Sox team that had issues with big velocity throughout the season. Particularly in September, after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/\">Roman Anthony</a> hurt his oblique, they were among the worst teams in baseball against 95 mph fastballs and above. Boston's weaknesses aligned with Schlittler's strengths pretty much perfectly.  </p>\n<p>The Red Sox put the leadoff man on base in the second, fifth, and sixth innings against Schlittler but never had a runner reach third base. He struck out 12, the most ever by a Yankees' rookie in the postseason, and the most by any rookie since Livan Hernandez struck out 15 in Game 5 of the 1997 NLCS (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW8YkRiRUBw\" target=\"_blank\">with an assist to Eric Gregg's strike zone</a>).</p><p>\"I woke up and I was locked in,\" Schlittler said. \"I knew exactly what I needed to do and go out there, especially against my hometown team. As I told Andy (Pettitte) yesterday, I wasn't going to let them beat me. I was just overconfident in that fact. Making sure I wasn't getting too carried away with it.\"</p><p>Schlittler is the first pitcher in postseason history, rookie or otherwise, to throw eight shutout innings while striking out 12 and walking zero. Game 3 was not an out-of-nowhere performance. Schlittler threw 73 innings across 15 starts with a 2.96 ERA during the regular season, and beat out reigning AL Rookie of the Year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829343/luis-gil/\">Luis Gil</a> for Thursday's start. He was out there because he earned it.</p>\n<p>The Yankees lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1893753/gerrit-cole/\">Gerrit Cole</a> to Tommy John surgery in spring training and managed to dig up a pretty good facsimile of Cole in Schlittler, who looks like a more-than-worthy No. 3 behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001078/max-fried/\">Max Fried</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2138665/carlos-rdon/\">Carlos Ródon</a>. He is a massive player development success story and and quickly cemented himself as an indispensable Yankee.  </p><p>So now the Yankees are where they finished the regular season -- tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a>. Schlittler's gem put the Yankees in the ALDS against a Toronto team that beat them out for a division title via tiebreaker. Schlittler likely won't start again until a possible Game 4 of that series, but without him, the Yankees might not even be playing in it.  </p><p>\"It is electric.  Yankee fans are very passionate.  It was very loud from  the jump,\" Schlittler said about the ovation he received coming off the mound after the eighth inning. \"And that's what they told me would happen.  It was a great  feeling and I was able to channel that energy.  They were definitely  behind me and the team.  That was a great feeling.\"</p>\n            </div>",

Although the Aces' 17-game winning streak was impressive, they struggled against opponents they were expected to easily take care of. Meanwhile, Phoenix got through the defending champion New York Liberty and the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx by embracing the underdog mentality. The confidence, energy and aggressive style of play the Mercury bring every night shows how locked in and hungry they are. </p><p><strong>Maloney: Aces in 7. </strong>The Aces have the best player and home-court advantage, but they've gone the distance in both of their previous series and almost lost to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a> team that by overtime of Game 5 was without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677896/kelsey-mitchell/\">Kelsey Mitchell</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677770/sophie-cunningham/\">Sophie Cunningham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678028/aari-mcdonald/\">Aari McDonald</a>. The Mercury took out last season's finalists in succession in the first two rounds and have their own MVP candidate, but have gotten a lot of injury luck -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678022/breanna-stewart/\">Breanna Stewart</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29334556/leonie-fiebich/\">Leonie Fiebich</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678040/dijonai-carrington/\">DiJonai Carrington</a> were all either out or wounded during their series -- and needed multiple historic comebacks to get to this point. </p>\n<p>We also don't know how the first ever best-of-seven series will impact proceedings. It's not surprising that the bookies don't seem to have a firm grasp on what will happen either. The Aces are -130, while the Mercury are +110 to win the title, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars</a>. In other words, this is a toss-up, with a slight lean to the Aces due to home-court advantage. It's admittedly difficult to pick the Aces after watching them almost lose to the extremely shorthanded Fever, but they have the best player, home-court advantage and the championship experience and know-how to come through in late-game situations. That will make the slightest difference in the end.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO</span> -- If you're not a white-knuckled partisan of either team -- chair arms firmly and punishingly clenched -- then the ninth inning of NL Wild Card Series Game 3 between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> is what you want out of playoff baseball. In the deciding game of the series, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-wild-card-2025-cubs-padres-game-3-live-updates-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">won 3-1 by the host Cubs</a>, the final inning provided intensity and drama worthy of October. It also merits revisiting as the Cubs prepare to duel with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Milwaukee Brewers</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/brewers-vs-cubs-nlds-schedule-prediction-odds-division-rivals-meet-for-first-time-in-mlb-playoffs/\" target=\"_blank\">in the Division Series</a></span> and the narrowly vanquished Padres begin their offseason. </p><p>It began with the Cubs up 3-0 and reliever <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/\">Brad Keller</a> on the mound for his second frame of work after not appearing in Wednesday's loss. Per basic win expectancy, the Cubs had a 96.8% chance of winning and closing out the series. Even before a pitch was thrown, it never felt that secure. </p><p>It certainly didn't after the third pitch was thrown, a low-and-inside 1-1 changeup from Keller that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26719676/jackson-merrill/\">Jackson Merrill</a> lashed for a home run to right-center and the Padres' first run of the game. This season, 14 of Merrill's 16 regular-season home runs came against right-handers like Keller. Counsell still had a lefty in the pen available, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2164751/taylor-rogers/\">Taylor Rogers</a> pitched in Game 2 and has generally struggled this season when working back-to-back days. </p>\n<p>The next crucial moment of the top of the ninth came with a full count on the next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945481/xander-bogaerts/\">Xander Bogaerts</a>. Keller placed a 3-2 fastball near the lower outside corner of the zone and catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044542/carson-kelly/\">Carson Kelly</a> snatch-framed it for a called strike three. Those watching via the magic of color-television saw it as an egregious miss on the part of plate ump D.J. Reyburn: </p>\n<p>\"Looked down to me,\" Padres manager Mike Shildt said after the game. \"You know, but I don't see great, and I am kind of far away. But most importantly, Bogey felt like he was down. He is not a guy -- you know, not any of our guys really, but Bogey in particular is not a guy that's overly dramatic about close pitches. It's a big pitch. It's a big swing pitch. You know, it turns the tying run and what would have unfolded after that could have been very impactful, but we had other opportunities, too.\"</p><p>Had this same pitch happened next year, Bogaerts surely would've tapped his helmet to challenge the pitch under the forthcoming ABS system. And just as surely it would've been ball four instead of strike three. Right? Maybe. However, Statcast graded the pitch as strike: </p><figure><p><img alt=\"bogaertspitch.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/03/4a1adeac-65af-4b67-9c64-c4e87e1e74d6/resize/670x377/6080b81958f203ee684b303254046025/bogaertspitch.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Baseball Savant\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>So maybe not, given that Statcast has better inputs than the K zone on your TV. The strike zone remains a many-splendored thing. The end result, though, is that the Padres instead of having the tying run at the plate with no outs had the bases empty and one out. For whatever it's worth, absent the fractured finger that sidelined him for this series, hot-hitting deadline addition Ramón Laureano probably would've batted in this spot. </p>\n<p>What happened next may have momentarily helped the Padres get past that potential missed call. Keller overcooked a 2-2 fastball and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211177/ryan-ohearn/\">Ryan O'Hearn</a>. Then a 1-2 changeup got away from him and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837044/bryce-johnson/\">Bryce Johnson</a>'s foot. That put the potential tying run on and thus brought the potential go-ahead run up in the person of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447496/jake-cronenworth/\">Jake Cronenworth</a>, and at that point Counsell went to right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2228478/andrew-kittredge/\">Andrew Kittredge</a>, who'd pitched in both Games 1 and 2 of the series. </p><p>That led to the next fraught moment of the inning: </p><p>The challenge was a worthy one given the moment, but Cronenworth was indeed out despite what seemed to be a brief hesitation on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153549/matt-shaw/\">Matt Shaw</a>'s part before making the throw across the diamond. The Padres, no doubt, were left wondering what if Bogaerts had gotten that call above and the bases had been loaded. Is Shaw positioned differently, so as to make the play easier or harder? Does he start a 5-4-3 instead? Or does the change in base-out state change the pitch selection and thus the batted-ball outcome altogether? Unknowns abound, except in reality where it was two on two out and a two-run margin. </p><p>With the game on the line, Freddy Fermín put a good swing on a first-pitch sinker from Kitteredge but got just a bit under it. He hit hard, but the high launch angle made it peter out at 354 feet and into the able glove of Cubs center fielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>. Like Cronenworth's batted ball, Fermin's had an expected batting average of just .170, and again the Padres were on the short end of the odds. </p>\n<p>As it was in the ninth, it was for the series from the San Diego standpoint -- just the wrong angle, the wrong bounce, the wrong flip of the coin. </p>\n            </div>",

Things went south for the team last year as they went 4-13 and were without quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> for seven games due to a shoulder injury and a concussion.</p><p>As a result of the dismal season, there was an overhaul to the coaching staff. Head coach Doug Pederson was fired and replaced by former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> offensive coordinator Liam Coen, while new offensive and defensive coordinators were brought in.</p><p>The changes appear to be working, as the Jaguars enter their matchup with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> on Monday Night Football in Week 5 of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> for first place in the AFC South with a 3-1 record. Jacksonville's only loss was a 31-27 road setback against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in which it allowed the game-winning touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Kansas City, which was embarrassed last February by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in its quest to become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls, began this campaign with back-to-back losses against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> and Eagles. The disappointing start led many to wonder if the team's dominance in the AFC West was coming to an end.</p><p>But the Chiefs seem to be turning things around as they posted victories over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> to even their record at 2-2. Thanks to New York's triumph over Los Angeles in Week 4, Kansas City is just one game behind the division-leading Chargers, and its chances for a 10th straight division title are very much alive.</p>\n<p>With both teams entering their Monday night showdown having posted back-to-back wins, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes Jacksonville and Kansas City each have a solid chance to make the playoffs. But its projection model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is more confident in the Chiefs as it sees them reaching the postseason well over 84% of the time and the Jaguars in just over 57% of its simulations.</p><p>The ITL team's model has crunched the numbers for Monday's contest at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville, as well as every NFL game for the remainder of the season, and its simulations say a loss by the Chiefs wouldn't be devastating to their playoff outlook.

In other games involving AFC East foes, the Dolphins (1-3) are 1.5-point favorites against the Panthers (1-3) at Carolina, while the Jets (0-4) are 2.5-point underdogs against the visiting Cowboys (1-2-1) in the latest Week 5 NFL odds. The week kicks off with 49ers vs. Rams (-8.5) on 'Thursday Night Football' as Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings are among the key players out for the Niners.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Facing a depleted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a> team on Thursday night, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> still came up short, 23-20 in overtime, when running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a> was stuffed on fourth down. After the game, Rams coach Sean McVay was extremely critical of his own decision-making on the final play.</p><p>Instead of kicking a field goal on 4th-and-1 at the 49ers' 11-yard line to tie the game, McVay went for the win, but the 49ers were ready for it and met Williams in the backfield to stop him well short of the sticks for the win.</p>\n<p>In his postgame press conference, McVay said he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2nwcPzU4PQ\" target=\"_blank\">didn't regret the decision to go for it</a> on fourth down but was \"sick\" over his play selection.</p><p>\"We came in here to try to win the football game,\" McVay said. \"It didn't go down for us. That wasn't even a thought, but the play selection was very poor. I'm sick right now because I put our players in a shitty spot, and I've gotta live with that.\"</p><p>McVay didn't give any specifics about why he thought that particular play call was a bad one, saying he simply didn't put the Rams in position to make a big play.</p>\n<p>\"My job is to put our players in successful situations and outcomes, and that wasn't it right there,\" McVay said.</p><p>Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> took the podium after McVay and defended his coach. Stafford called it a \"bread-and-butter\" play for the Rams and took some responsibility for the loss himself.</p><p>\"I didn't have any problem with it,\" Stafford said. \"That's trusting our guys to go out there and make a play. They did a nice job stopping it. Frustrating that we didn't get it. I wish I would've done more and found a way to help us win.\"</p>\n<p>Even without a handful of key players on offense, including quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a>, the 49ers jumped out to a 20-7 lead over the Rams. Los Angeles rallied to tie the game late in the fourth quarter, but between a Williams fumble at the goal line and the unsuccessful fourth-down conversion, it had a number of miscues. </p>\n            </div>",

Chelsea has played three of their last four matches with 10 men, which includes dropping a 3-1 decision to Brighton last Saturday. On the Liverpool side, they fell 2-1 to Crystal Palace last Saturday and fell to <span>Galatasaray</span> on Tuesday in Champions League action. The Reds are in first place in the Premier League table right now entering Matchday 7, while Chelsea sits in eighth place with eight points.</p><p>Kickoff from Stamford Bridge in Chelsea is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. The hosts are +190 underdogs (wager $100 to win $190) on the 90-minute money line at BetMGM while Liverpool are +125 favorites (wager $100 to win $125). A draw is priced at +260, and the total is 3.5 (Over +125, Under -175).

Unfortunately, that's not what we should expect to see at Stamford Bridge. We have two massive clubs who are frankly exhausted and would probably rather not be playing in this fixture. Liverpool and Chelsea are both preparing for this weekend match after tiring Champions League matches.</p><p>Liverpool made the brutal journey to Istanbul where they were shut down by Turkish side Galatasaray, while Chelsea managed a 1-0 win in a match that saw them earning their third red card in four matches. While the teams are exhausted, they also had to deal with some significant injuries.</p><p>Allison, the goalkeeper and backbone of Liverpool, has already announced he will not be available for this match. Chelsea will still be without the services of their most prolific scorer, <span>Cole Palmer</span>. This is normally an exciting competition, but I wouldn't be shocked if we saw defense take priority with both teams happy sharing the spoils and walking away with a point. I'm expecting to see less goals here than normal with both teams trying to end on a high note before going off into the next international break.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> had a chance to take down a division rival and move into sole possession of first place on Thursday night, but instead, they came up empty after making several huge mistakes during the late stages of their 26-23 overtime loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p><p>The Rams, who were favored by 8.5 points, became an upset victim because they couldn't get out of their own way in the fourth quarter. Although <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> threw for 389 yards and three touchdowns, it wasn't quite enough to overcome the Rams' costly errors. </p><p>Let's cover the three biggest errors that the Rams made from the fourth quarter and overtime. </p><h2>The Rams gave up another blocked kick</h2><p>The Rams trailed 20-7 in the third quarter, but thanks to Stafford, they were quickly able to erase that deficit. The Rams quarterback threw a touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> in the third quarter to cut the lead to 20-14. In the fourth quarter, it looked like the Rams were going to take a 21-20 lead after Kyren Wililams caught an 8-yard scoring pass, but that didn't happen, because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-kartys/\">Joshua Karty's</a> extra point got blocked. </p>\n<p>The block by the 49ers kept the score knotted at 20 with 10:39 left in the game. The Rams field goal team has had a serious problem with protection this year. This extra point attempt marked the third time since Week 3 that Karty has had a kick blocked and the painful part is that all three blocks have come in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Karty also missed a 53-yard field goal in the game, so special teams cost the Rams a total of four points. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a>' fumble in the fourth quarter</h2><p>With just 2:52 left to play and the Rams trailing 23-20, Los Angeles took over possession at its own 35-yard line with a chance to tie or win the game. </p>\n<p>Matthew Stafford quickly drove the Rams into scoring position on a drive where he completed two passes for 29 yards. After a 20-yard run from Kyren Williams, the Rams quickly found themselves on the cusp of scoring a possible go-ahead touchdown with a first-and-goal at San Francisco's 3-yard line. However, they ended up getting ZERO points on the drive because Williams fumbled the ball away at the 1-yard line. </p>\n<p>The fumble was forced by 49ers rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/\">Alfred Collins</a> who threw a perfect punch at the football to knock it loose. If Williams had scored a touchdown, it would have put the Rams up 27-23 with just 1:05 left to play, but instead, the 49ers took over possession at their own 1-yard line. </p><p>The Rams did force a three-and-out on the ensuing 49ers' drive and Stafford then quickly drove his team into field goal range to force overtime after Karty nailed a 48-yard kick. </p>\n<h2>Errant kickoff to start overtime </h2><p>Karty didn't get to celebrate his game-tying field goal for very long, because, on the first play of overtime, he made a brutal mistake. When Karty kicks off, he generally hits a knuckleball and that had been working well all night until the game got to overtime. In the extra session, Karty got penalized because his kickoff didn't make it to the landing zone. The penalty set the 49ers up with the ball at their 40-yard line. </p><p>From there, the 49ers didn't have to drive very far to get in field goal range. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> ended up taking them 37 yards to set up Eddy Pinero's 41-yard field goal that proved to be the game-winning points. </p><h2>Sean McVay admits his 'poor' play call cost his team the game</h2><p>Under this year's overtime rules, both teams are guaranteed one possession, so the 49ers had to kickoff to the Rams after Piniero's field goal. The Rams took over at their own 33-yard line and Stafford immediately drove them 56 yards down to San Francisco's 11-yard line, where they eventually faced a fourth-and-1. </p>\n<p>At that point, Rams coach Sean McVay had two options: He could kick the field and tie up the game or he could go for the first down. The usually conservative coach decided to go for it and that decision backfired after he called a run up the middle. </p>\n<p>Williams never had a chance. </p><p>After the game, McVay was asked about the play call and he was clearly frustrated with himself. </p><p>\"The play selection was very poor,\" McVay said. \"I'm sick right now because I put our players in a shitty spot and I have to live with that.\"</p>\n<p>Stafford was on fire in the fourth quarter and overtime, throwing for a total of 194 yards. The Rams had a six-play drive in overtime and the first five plays were all passes. With Stafford playing so well, it probably would have made sense to put the ball in his hands, but McVay had Williams run up the middle. </p><p>If you want our full takeaways from the 49ers win, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-vs-49ers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-as-san-francisco-surprisingly-controls-first-half/live/\" target=\"_blank\">we've got those here</a>. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>INGELWOOD, Calif. -- 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan must feel like he's living in a fever dream after his team exited SoFi Stadium with a dramatic 26-23 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday.</p><p>To understand why, you have to go back to the spring of 2021, when San Francisco made the bold decision to trade up to the No. 3 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. With Trevor Lawrence and Zach Wilson off the board, the 49ers had a decision to make: Take either Justin Fields, Trey Lance, or Mac Jones.</p><p>As the story goes, the 49ers picked Lance, but it never quite worked out. However, just over four years after that, Shanahan's team was in a pinch because its $265 million quarterback (Brock Purdy) was going to miss his third game in the last four weeks because of a turf toe injury,</p><p>Because of that, Jones got to offer a glimpse of what might've happened if there had been a partnership with one of the top offensive minds in the game from the jump. Jones finished 33 of 49 for 342 yards and two touchdowns and led the 49ers to an improbable win over their NFC West rival as an 8.5-point underdog to help his team move to 4-1.</p>\n<p>After going 1-5 against division opponents during an injury-riddled 2024 season, the 49ers are firmly at the top of the division with a 3-0 record against those opponents.</p><p>\"He played his ass off,\" Shanahan said. \"(Mac) was unbelievable in the first half. Got banged up in the second half and battled through it and protected the ball going against that defense. Throwing the ball that many times without having a turnover. I can't say enough good things about Mac.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/overreactions-from-49ers-win-over-rams-kyren-williams-costs-l-a-nfc-west-mac-jones-remains-49ers-starter/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Overreactions from 49ers win over Rams: Kyren Williams costs L.A.

Like Jones, he also had a day to remember, finishing with a career-high 142 receiving yards on 10 catches.</p><p>49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who played with Bourne previously and is one of the longest tenured players on his team, described the energy boost the team received when he was brought back last month.</p>\n<p>\"It's awesome (to have him back),\" Juszczyk told CBS Sports. \"He's such a reliable player. He brings so much energy.\"</p><h2>How the 49ers' offseason reset is paying dividends</h2><p>After finishing 6-11 last season and a year removed from a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII, big changes to the roster were inevitable to hand out more big contracts -- like Purdy's -- this past offseason.</p><p>The franchise traded away star wide receiver Deebo Samuel to the Washington Commanders and running back Jordan Mason to the Minnesota Vikings. San Francisco also lost safety Talanoa Hufanga, linebacker Dre Greenlaw, offensive lineman Aaron Banks and cornerback Charvarius Ward, among others, during free agency.</p>\n<p>The reshuffling of the roster was part of a calculated plan to reset the books, lock down blue-chip players and build up the defensive line through the draft, with defensive coordinator Robert Saleh returning, which made the 49ers a Super Bowl contender in the first place.</p><p>The 49ers spent their first five picks in last spring's draft on defenders, which included drafting defensive lineman Mykel Williams and Alfred Collins and nickelback Upton Stout in the first three rounds. </p><p>Collins, a mammoth defensive tackle out of Texas, started his NFL career slowly with just three total tackles in his first four games. But with the 49ers shorthanded, he made one of the most impressive plays of the season by punching the ball out of Rams star running back Kyren Williams near the goal line during the final minutes of regulation.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-meltdown-in-loss-to-49ers-due-to-three-ugly-mistakes-late-in-the-game-and-one-very-poor-play-call/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Rams' meltdown in loss to 49ers due to three ugly mistakes late in the game, and one very 'poor' play call</p>\n                <p>\n                    John Breech                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Rams' meltdown in loss to 49ers due to three ugly mistakes late in the game, and one very 'poor' play call\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/03/9411979a-b776-480a-b644-be5ca60bd7e2/thumbnail/270x152/4c6e3cafc4f13fdf7b33018cf18a277c/untitled-design-2025-10-02t230200-369.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>\"AC has gotten consistently better since he's shown up,\" 49ers defensive end Bryce Huff told CBS Sports. \"I remember him being in the locker room and just chopping away, just getting better and better. He showed up tonight. Made some huge plays.\"</p><p>The signature moment of Collins' young NFL career didn't seal the win initially for the 49ers, but the play was part of a theme of players on the roster stepping up down the stretch.</p>\n<p>In Week 1, Bosa stripped Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold and recovered the fumble to seal the game. The following week, Huff made the big play against the New Orleans Saints with a sack that gave his team a 26-21 win. During the 49ers' 16-15 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, Stout recorded a key pass breakup on third down, which allowed Jones to lead his team down the field for a field goal as time expired on the following possession.</p>\n<p>And when push came to shove and the game was on the line, it was two rookies who helped end the game. Collins, fifth-round rookie Marques Sigle and star cornerback Deommodore Lenoir stopped Williams short on fourth-and-1 to give San Francisco a win that might've very well gone the other way last season.</p><p>\"(49ers general manager) John Lynch is probably going to celebrate on the plane tonight,\" Warner said. \"Alfred Collins, unbelievable play on the 1-yard line. ... our young (have been) playing big for us. They're just getting started.\"</p><h2>Reinforcements on the way for San Francisco?</h2><p>Even better news for the 49ers ahead of a (mini) 10-day bye week is that help could be on the way. <a href=\"https://x.com/rapsheet/status/1973895244425924894?s=46&t=mGlbl99q5ipiLnc14_5IgA\" target=\"_blank\">Before the game, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported </a>that reinforcements could be on the way for a marquee showdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next weekend.</p>\n<p>Rapoport noted that Pearsall, Jennings and Kittle could all return in Week 6, while Purdy remains week-to-week with the turf toe injury. If Purdy can't go, Jones will start for the fourth time in a 49ers uniform. </p><p>\"They brought me here to play as a backup and that's my job,\" Jones said. \"Brock's the starter of this team. Right nowhe's dealing with something and for him to go out last week and play when you probably know he's not at full health shows a lot. I'm just trying to get some wins for this team so it helps us down the line.\"</p><p>San Francisco entered the night with the second-best odds (+230) to win the NFC West behind the Rams,<a href=\"https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/nfl?tab=divisions\" target=\"_blank\"> per FanDuel.</a> Those odds have since flipped, as the 49ers (-105) are now the favorites ahead of the Rams and Seahawks to win the division after starting 3-0 against NFC West competition.</p>\n<p>The 49ers took a risk by saying goodbye to several key players last offseason and flipping their roster with young, cost-controlled talent. The early returns suggest that the plan may work. If Thursday -- or the previous other four games -- were any indication of what's to come, it's that this version of the 49ers could be a dangerous out in January.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>There are 11 teams with one win or fewer through Week 4 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season. Those teams are not created equally, however. For example, few would suggest that Baltimore and Dallas' odds of securing the No. 1 overall selection in the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> are as good as those of either New Orleans or Tennessee. </p><p>Reflecting upon last season, the Browns lost to the Giants in Week 3 of the 2024 NFL season. Ultimately, it was the difference between New York picking No. 2 overall and No. 3 overall. Had the Giants been in position to pick No. 2 overall, would they have traded with Jacksonville (Travis Hunter Jr.) or taken Abdul Carter?</p><p>Forecasting out the rest of the NFL season, there are some games likely to determine the draft order. Intra-divisional meetings, such as Browns-Bengals, Panthers-Saints and Jets-Dolphins, were excluded for the purpose of this exercise, as they are relatively straightforward.</p><p>Here are the 10 games that may impact the order in which teams select next April:</p>\n<h2>10. Jets at Bengals (Week 8)</h2><p>Cincinnati already has two wins on the season, but the elevator may not go much higher given Joe Burrow's injury. Over the past five years, the team in possession of the No. 1 overall selection finished the campaign with three wins; one win and two were enough to secure the deed otherwise. Three winless teams remain, including the Jets, and an additional eight have just one win on the season. A handful of those teams will be mentioned throughout the story. </p><p>Even if Burrow returns this season, he will not be available Week 8 against Justin Fields and the Jets. Will a Jake Browning-Justin Fields affair factor into the draft race? </p><h2>9. Bengals at Dolphins (Week 16)</h2><p>Miami has a lone win on the season and it is difficult to imagine many wins are around the turn post-Tyreek Hill injury. Desperation may take hold of head coach Mike Macdaniel as he fights for his job, but will the team be lost by Week 16? Could Burrow be back at that point in the season? Tua Tagovailoa may be competing for his role in Miami or elsewhere. There are so many unknowns considering a game three months away. </p>\n<h2>8. Browns at Jets (Week 10)</h2><p>These two teams have met eight of the past 10 seasons. The stakes of the contest are usually draft-related rather than postseason. It would be a fit of irony if Tyrod Taylor were starting that game, considering Taylor lost his job as the Browns' starting quarterback to No. 1 overall selection Baker Mayfield against the Jets. Cleveland may be starting their third or fourth quarterback of the year by that point.</p><h2>7. Titans at Browns (Week 14)</h2><p>The initial rights holders to the Nos. 1 and 2 overall selections in the 2025 NFL Draft may be competing for the same real estate once again. They have a combined one win on the season. Tennessee has its franchise quarterback, so it will almost certainly be looking to win some games and build momentum down the stretch. If they do happen to land the No. 1 overall selection and a quarterback prospect emerges, then they could trade the pick for resources that should, in theory, help them win football games.</p><h2>6. Dolphins at Browns (Week 7)</h2><p>Moving on from Tagovailoa after this season is unlikely because of the dead salary cap hit that would balloon. However, there could absolutely be a scenario in which Miami drafts a quarterback in the first round, sits that player for a period of time and then transitions to that player for the 2027 season. The Dolphins' coaching staff and front office must be competitive, so there is urgency for them to steal a few of these games. If the team is out of contention, ownership may shift direction mid-season as part of a more long-term approach to roster building. </p>\n<h2>5. Panthers at Jets (Week 7)</h2><p>Carolina would be in possession of the No. 1 overall selection for the third time in four years; that is clearly not progress. In that scenario, would they be a sneaky team in the quarterback market? Bryce Young is in the third year of his rookie contract and the team will soon have to make a decision on his fifth-year option. The Jets almost certainly will be pursuing a quarterback in the draft.</p><h2>4. Dolphins at Panthers (Week 5)</h2><p>Week 5, Sunday, marks the earliest of the games on this list. Each of these teams has one win on the season. A second win would push them towards the limit of being in contention for the No. 1 overall selection. </p><h2>3. Jets at Saints (Week 16)</h2><p>The Battle of First-Year Head Coaches will play out three weeks before the season ends. Spencer Rattler's play has, at the very least, been interesting. He could be playing for an extended look, or the team may have already gone to rookie quarterback Tyler Shough. </p>\n<p>New York does not have a potential quarterback of the future on the roster. Tyrod Taylor is backing up Fields.</p><h2>2. Saints at Dolphins (Week 13)</h2><p>Miami's fourth game on the list may be its biggest. New Orleans is one of three winless teams remaining. A lot will change between now and late November, but it is unlikely that a lot of separation will be created between these two teams in the draft order. The Saints' investment of a high second-round pick in 26-year-old quarterback Tyler Shough continues to mystify, as the team could once again find itself in the quarterback market. </p><h2>1.  Saints at Titans (Week 17)</h2><p>The penultimate week of the NFL regular season brings a potential matchup between contenders for the No. 1 overall selection. If the Saints' season does not take a turn for the better, it will be easy to envision them having little to play for while Tennessee tries to create some positive offseason momentum with its rookie quarterback. </p>\n<p>Giants at Saints (Week 5), Titans at Raiders (Week 6) and a variety of Patriots games were also under consideration for the list.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span><strong> —</strong> Defense was supposed to be the fix. That was what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> chased all season. Last year, the team was buried -- second-to-last in the majors with 115 errors. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> had more, at 117. So <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184351/alex-bregman/\">Alex Bregman</a> was acquired, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165929/rafael-devers/\">Rafael Devers</a> was slid to DH, then eventually traded. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/\">Trevor Story</a> stayed healthy, which allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931004/ceddanne-rafaela/\">Ceddanne Rafaela</a> to be moved back to center, where a Gold Glove will likely be won.</p><p>By the numbers, Boston's outfield was rated the best in baseball, racking up 52 defensive runs saved. But defensive metrics can be tricky because the full story isn't told. They can be flawed. And if the Red Sox are watched long enough, their defensive flaws are seen, too.</p><p>So in Game 3 of the Wild Card, under the lights in the Bronx, mistakes piled up again. In a blink, the season was gone, sealed by a 4-0 loss. The rival Yankees scored all four runs in the fourth inning. </p><p>Red Sox rookie starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658250/connelly-early/\">Connelly Early</a> entered the top of the fourth inning with just 45 pitches, going toe-to-toe with fellow rookie Cam Schlittler, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/cam-schlittler-rewards-yankees-faith-with-unforgettable-12-strikeout-outing-that-ends-red-soxs-season/\" target=\"_blank\">who would eventually turn in eight scoreless frames and 12 strikeouts</a></span>. The most by a Yankee rookie in postseason history.</p>\n<p>\"We needed to be perfect tonight because he was perfect,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said after the game.</p><p>In a 0-0 game, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> worked the count to 3-2. On the sixth pitch of the at-bat, a fly ball was lofted to right-center field. It dropped in for a double, beginning a nose dive from which the Red Sox could not recover.</p>\n<p>\"I think Wilyer broke back, right, with a swing,\" added Cora. \"Just somebody, right? They have to make that play. With the swing, he didn't get a good jump and it just landed there. That's a play we make.\"</p>\n<p>Yet it was a play that Abreu sometimes struggled with.</p><p>The ball landed in short right-center, bouncing off the glove of the diving Rafaela. Abreu, indeed, broke back -- not for the first time. More on that later. A direct angle was had to the ball but he pulled up once Rafaela was seen.</p><p>\"That was a tough play,\" Abreu said. \"It was in between us. We were playing very far away so we couldn't get there.\"</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>Abreu, who won a Gold Glove last year, has often been guilty of over-committing. And it is done too soon. His internal clock has lacked feel and timing. While many balls are reached diagonally, going back or charging in has been a struggle. On this play, instead of patience and a proper read, a commitment backward was made immediately. The safe move, of course, is always to take a step back. Getting burned on a ball in is far worse -- a double over your head more times than not. But this has happened to Abreu way too often. Just look at the play last week against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a>, the final series of the season.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931997/parker-meadows/\">Parker Meadows</a> hit a weak fly ball off the end of the bat. A ball that should have been caught. But again, Abreu's aggressive commitment back allowed it to drop in for a single.</p><p>Then there is the Rafaela element. Typically, great reads and jumps are made, relying more on feel than calculation. The outfield is played like a cornerback in football -- freakish athletic ability with a knack for covering ground quickly.</p><p>But a banana route was taken this time. Almost in a semi-circle before the line was corrected. Neither of them called the ball.</p>\n<p>\"I just gave my all to catch that ball,\" Rafaela said. \"I saw that Willie didn't maybe have a chance, so I gave it my all to catch that ball.\"</p><p>Communication issues in the outfield plagued the Red Sox all season. And, in part, Rafaela was expected to catch everything.</p><p>Go back to the late August matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a>. A ball in left field should have been caught by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932710/jarren-duran/\">Jarren Duran</a>, but Rafaela was expected to take it, so it dropped between them.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox finished just outside the top 10 in DRS. The left side of the infield was shored up. Center field improved. And still, the majors were led in errors with 116 -- one more than last year. The final run-scoring play of the Red Sox season came on an error as first baseman Nathaniel Lowe botched a grounder off the bat of Ben Rice.</p><p>Those lapses are the reason the packing up is being done early, the team headed home as October begins.</p><p>\"Obviously, we should feel the way we feel right now, because we had bigger goals,\" Cora said. \"But when we have time to reflect on how we did things this year, this is what the Boston Red Sox are, it's a good group.\"</p>\n<p>Just not good enough in Game 3.</p>\n            </div>",

The Nittany Lions are coming off a heartbreaking double-overtime loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> last weekend and will look to bounce back against one of the few winless teams in the FBS. </p><p>The Nittany Lions started the season 3-0 with wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEVADA/nevada-wolf-pack/\">Nevada</a>, FIU and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NOVA/villanova-wildcats/\">Villanova</a> before facing their first-ranked opponent of the 2025 campaign. With the loss to Oregon, Penn State coach James Franklin dropped to 2-21 during his tenure when facing an opponent ranked in the top six of the AP Top 25 poll. </p><p>UCLA entered this season with a significant amount of hype after landing former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/\">Nico Iamaleava</a> via the transfer portal. The Bruins fired their former coach, DeShaun Foster, last month following an embarrassing loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NMEX/new-mexico-lobos/\">New Mexico</a> at home and are one of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/predicting-every-winless-college-football-teams-first-victory-will-ucla-nico-iamaleava-upset-a-big-ten-foe/\" target=\"_blank\">just four FBS teams that haven't won a game this season</a></span>. </p><h2>Penn State vs. UCLA: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Penn State has an opportunity to get back on track:</strong> The Nittany Lions missed a marquee opportunity to steal a game at home after being down by double digits in the fourth quarter against Oregon. A win over the Ducks in a rematch of last season's Big Ten title game would've changed the trajectory of the entire season, but Penn State will have to turn the page fast with an interesting stretch of games upcoming starting with a cross-country trip to Southern California.</p><p><strong>UCLA's OL vs. Penn State's DL is the matchup to watch:</strong> This game will be won (and lost) in the trenches. Penn State has a stout defensive line headlined by star edge rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28891492/dani-dennis-sutton/\">Dani Dennis-Sutton</a>. In total, seven different players on the Nittany Lions' roster have recorded at least one sack this season. Meanwhile, Iamaleava has been one of the most pressured quarterbacks in the Big Ten this season. If Penn State's defensive line can get home, it could be a long day for the Bruins.</p>\n<p><strong>UCLA is on the wrong side of a dreadful stat: </strong>The only team in the FBS that hasn't led at any point this season is UCLA. After losing by 65 points combined during its first three games, UCLA showed fight against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a> last weekend. The Bruins mounted a comeback and had a chance to send the game to overtime on their final drive, but time ran out. UCLA's final drive -- which lasted 1:29 -- netted just a single yard on five plays.</p><h2> Where to watch Penn State vs. UCLA live </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location</strong>: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.<br /> <strong>TV: </strong>CBS | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/big-ten-football?ftag=CBS-03-10adg7j\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/QeYaC8MVDqb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a><br /> <strong>Streaming on</strong> <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a></p><h2> Penn State vs. UCLA predictions, pick<br />  </h2>\n<p>Penn State is coming off an emotional loss, while UCLA is searching to lead in a game for the first time this season. Something will have to give on Saturday. Penn State's defense should be able to get pressure on Iamaleava, which could make it a long day for UCLA's offense. However, look for the Bruins to cover. They're coming off their best showing of the season against Northwestern. Penn State will win this game, but won't cover the nearly four-touchdown spread. <strong>PICK: </strong><em><strong>UCLA +26.5</strong></em></p>\n<div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The calendar has officially flipped to October, and the second month of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season is on deck. The league is coming off an incredible slate in Week 4, and Week 5 promises to carry the baton, with several intriguing games/storylines that we're monitoring. For instance, we have another international game to begin the Sunday slate, which includes the debut of a rookie quarterback for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a>. Stateside, both the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> will look to remain undefeated after a perfect opening month, while a trio of other clubs are still hunting for their first win of 2025. </p><p>As we await kickoff for the full Sunday slate, let's make sure you're caught up on all the major talking points heading into Week 5. Below, this cheat sheet will be your one-stop shop for everything you need to know surrounding Week 5, ranging from the top storylines, game of the week, and some betting and fantasy advice.</p><h2>Notable Week 5 storylines</h2><h3>London games begin 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 </h3><p>Don't put away your passport yet, because the international games are just getting started. After the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> went toe-to-toe in Dublin, Ireland, last week, it's now London's turn for some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> action. Sunday marks the beginning of a three-week period during which the league will play in England. First up will be the Vikings taking on the Browns. Minnesota is the first team to play international games in different countries in back-to-back weeks. </p><p>Here's a look at the upcoming London games: </p><ul><li><strong>Week 5:</strong> Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns (Tottenham Hotspur Stadium)</li><li><strong>Week 6:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a> (Tottenham Hotspur Stadium) </li><li><strong>Week 7:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> (Wembley Stadium) </li></ul><p>Later this year, the NFL will also have international games in Berlin, Germany (Week 10) and Madrid, Spain (Week 11). </p>\n<h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> named the Browns starting QB</h3>\n<p>Another fascinating layer to Sunday's London game is that the Cleveland Browns will be trotting out a new starting quarterback. This week, coach Kevin Stefanski announced that veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> will be benched in favor of rookie Dillon Gabriel. </p><p>Gabriel's ascension atop the depth chart doesn't come as too much of a shock after seeing Flacco through the first month. The 40-year-old signal-caller ranked bottom two among qualified quarterbacks in completion percentage (58%), yards per attempt (5.1), touchdown-to-interception ratio (2:6) and passer rating (60.3). Given those numbers, it makes sense for Cleveland to see what they have in Gabriel, but the spot is rough for the rookie as the Vikings boast one of the best defenses in the NFL. </p><p>Here are some nuggets about Gabriel and his first start for the Browns:</p><ul><li>Third round pick (No. 94 overall) at the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>.</li><li>Played his final collegiate season at Oregon.</li><li>Big Ten Most Valuable Player in 2024</li><li>41st different starting quarterback for the Browns since 1991</li><li>Browns QBs are 0-16 in their first career start since 1991</li><li>Gabriel will be the first quarterback in NFL history to make his first start outside of the United States.</li></ul><h3>Will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> be more involved in Eagles offense?</h3>\n<p>It's been a weird first month of the season for A.J. Brown. On the one hand, he's starting for the defending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champions, who have begun their title defense with a perfect 4-0 record. On the other hand, the wideout has barely been involved in the offense, and frustrations are starting to boil over. After last week's win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>, where he caught two passes (nine targets) for seven yards, Brown took to social media with a cryptic message that said, in part, \"If you're not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw.\" </p>\n<p>This week, Brown <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-a-j-brown-clears-the-air-after-controversial-social-media-post-i-let-my-frustrations-boil-over/\" target=\"_blank\">addressed that post</a></span> and admitted that his frustrations got the better of him while also telling reporters, \"This is my home. I love it here.\" While things may have simmered for Brown, the next question is whether he can return to being a prolific piece of this offense. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-ghosting-a-j-brown-superstar-wr-has-vanished-from-phillys-offense-and-the-numbers-are-unprecedented/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Eagles ghosting A.J.

The bulk of those totals (109) came in the second half of Week 3. As noted by CBS Sports Research, there have been two stretches this season where Brown has essentially gone four quarters without a catch. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> set to return after two-game absence</h3>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> are set to welcome back their franchise quarterback, Jayden Daniels, in Week 5. The second-year quarterback had been sidelined for the previous two games due to a sprained left knee he suffered in Week 2 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a>. Coach Dan Quinn told reporters this week that Daniels has been medically cleared to return, and the quarterback <a href=\"https://x.com/Commanders/status/1973455700451078161\" target=\"_blank\">said this week</a>, \"I plan on going out there on Sunday.\"</p>\n<p>Washington went 1-1 in Daniels' absence and will now take on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> on the road in Week 5. </p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> dealing with hamstring injury</h3>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> have been hit hard by injuries, none more notable than the situation surrounding Lamar Jackson. The MVP quarterback exited last Sunday's loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> with a hamstring injury, and reportedly could miss multiple weeks because of the ailment. He has yet to practice this week (Wednesday and Thursday), so his availability for Week 5's matchup against the Houston Texans is very much in doubt. If he is sidelined, backup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000176/cooper-rush/\">Cooper Rush</a> would get the start. </p><h3>Bye weeks 😴 </h3><p>For the first time this season, teams will be on the bye in Week 5.

Of course, Buffalo is the runaway favorite to win this division, but their next-biggest rival is a New England squad that appears to be on the doorstep of a breakout. The club has been up-and-down through the first month, but flashed its potential in Week 4 with a 42-13 win over Carolina. Specifically, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/\">Drake Maye</a>'s emergence in Year 2 has been noteworthy. The former No. 3 overall pick comes into this game leading the league with a 74% completion rate to go along with 247 yards passing and a 109.4 passer rating. He's thrown for seven touchdowns and two interceptions, while adding two more touchdowns on the ground. </p><p>This will be Maye's toughest task of the young season as the Bills are jumping out as the team to beat in the entire AFC. They are a perfect 4-0 coming into Week 5 and have dropped at least 30 points in each of those contests. Buffalo's offense is second in the NFL in points per game (33.3) and total yards per game (404.0). They also lead the league in rushing yards per game (163.5). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a>, the NFL's defending MVP, is just one of two quarterbacks to have 10 total touchdowns so far this season. </p><p>Another notable aspect of this game is that it'll be <a target=\"_blank\">Stefon Diggs</a>' first game back in Buffalo since the team traded him to Houston in April 2024. As a member of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> last season, Diggs, who spent four seasons with the Bills, did face them in Week 5, but that game was at NRG Stadium. In that game, Diggs caught six of his eight targets for 82 yards. </p>\n            </div>",

This will be the first meeting all-time between one of the sport's legacy brands in the Fighting Irish and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ashton-jeanty-may-be-off-to-the-nfl-but-high-expectations-havent-changed-for-boise-state-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">an ascendant modern power in the Broncos</a></span>. </p><p>After falling to 0-2 with a pair of losses against ranked opponents to start the season, Notre Dame has won its last two games by a combined score of 112-43. They're fresh off a 56-13 road trip to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a>, representing their largest margin of victory of the year. The <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/arkansas-fires-sam-pittman-razorbacks-move-on-from-football-coach-amid-2-3-start-and-32-344-overall-record/\" target=\"_blank\">Razorbacks fired coach</a></span> Sam Pittman one day after his now former team's loss to Notre Dame. </p><p>Boise State has put its own lackluster start to the 2025 season in the rearview mirror. The Broncos were stunned in a Week 1 upset loss against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SFLA/south-florida-bulls/\">South Florida</a>, but they've rattled off three straight wins since to keep their postseason hopes alive. Notre Dame will be the first Power Four-level team that Boise State faces this season. </p><p>Both of these teams made the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff last season and are seeking a return this year. That makes this a crucial game for the Fighting Irish and the Broncos. </p>\n<h2>Notre Dame vs. Boise State: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>Boise State finding its way: </strong>The biggest question facing Boise State this season was how it would replace All-American running back Ashton Jeanty, a 2024 Heisman Trophy finalist and the sixth overall pick in the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>. The early returns weren't great, as the Broncos put just seven points on the board in a stunning loss to South Florida. But they've quietly found their way sense, largely behind the arm of veteran quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28921239/maddux-madsen/\">Maddux Madsen</a>. The Broncos rank ninth nationally while averaging 520 yards per game, and their 299 yards passing per contest paces the Mountain West. Madsen has thrown for 1,129 yards and nine touchdowns to just one interception in four contests. Four Boise State receivers have at least 146 yards on the year and big-play threat <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28923387/chris-marshall/\">Chris Marshall</a> is averaging a whopping 21.6 yards per catch.    </p><p><strong>Notre Dame treading a fine line: </strong>Less than halfway through the season and Notre Dame has already blown its margin for error. The Fighting Irish are the only multi-loss team still ranked in the AP Top 25 poll, which shows that voters are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they cannot afford anymore setbacks if they wish to make a repeat appearance in the College Football Playoff. Fortunately for Notre Dame, it's riding a nine-game winning streak against unranked opponents, stretching back to 2024's stunning loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NILL/northern-illinois-huskies/\">Northern Illinois</a>. The Irish have won all nine of those games by at least 14 points, as well.   </p><p><strong>The Price is right: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133405/jeremiyah-love/\">Jeremiyah Love</a> demands most of the attention in Notre Dame's backfield, and deservedly so. There's a good reason why he's regarded as the top running back prospect in college football. But his counterpart, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875230/jadarian-price/\">Jadarian Price</a>, is making quite an impression thus far. He has scored eight total touchdowns on just 45 touches, including kickoff returns. That's good for one touchdown every 5.6 touches. Five of those touchdowns have covered at least 15 yards. He had a 100-yard kickoff returned for a score against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PURDUE/purdue-boilermakers/\">Purdue</a>. He's a multi-dimensional threat and one of the best scoring options on Notre Dame's roster, even with Love in the mix. </p>\n<h2>  Where to watch Notre Dame vs. Boise State live  </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br />  <strong>Location</strong>: Notre Dame Stadium -- South Bend, Indiana<br />  <strong>TV: </strong>NBC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>Notre Dame vs. Boise State prediction, picks  </h2>\n<p>The over seems like a smart bet any time this Notre Dame team is involved. The Fighting Irish very nearly hit it by themselves in their Week 5 win against Arkansas, though the Razorbacks helped push things over the edge. That now marks three straight games that Notre Dame has scored at least 40 points. Boise State has had an equally potent offense in the weeks since its season-opening letdown against South Florida. Though the Broncos may be limited by their ability to match up along the line of scrimmage, the point total in this one should climb well north of 60. <strong><em>Pick: Over 64.5

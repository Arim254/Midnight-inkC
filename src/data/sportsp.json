The previously winless Titans came back from down 21-3, and won, 22-21, thanks to a few inexcusable Arizona errors. </p><p>Early in the fourth quarter, Cardinals running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-cardinals-emari-demercado-drops-ball-before-end-zone-on-wide-open-touchdown/\" target=\"_blank\">dropped the football </a></span>before waltzing into the end zone on a wide-open touchdown, which empowered the Titans offense to march 80 yards for their first touchdown in two weeks. Then, down nine points, the Titans turned a Cardinals interception -- <em>into a Tennessee touchdown</em>.</p><p>Following an Arizona three-and-out, rookie quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> marched his offense down to the Cardinals' 20-yard line.

However, Taylor-Demerson lost possession of the ball on the ground -- before he was touched -- and it was kicked into the Cardinals end zone, where it was recovered by Titans wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1860834/tyler-lockett/\">Tyler Lockett</a> for a touchdown.</p><p>Check out the insane play, here: </p>\n<p>This play cut the deficit to two points -- after Arizona led by as many as 18.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Ahead of a dramatic battle for the final spot above the playoff cut line that saw two drivers literally go in opposite directions at the finish line, Shane van Gisbergen won the Bank of America Roval 400 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval to earn his fifth win of the season and the sixth of his NASCAR Cup Series career. After being eliminated from the playoffs in the Round of 16, SVG was able to put a period on his season as NASCAR's King of the Road, winning his fifth of the six Cup road course races this season and his fifth in a row.</p><p>While Van Gisbergen was able to outlast both Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell after a close and spirited race between the three drivers, the intrigue of Sunday's race wound up surrounding the cutoff for the Round of 8, which came down to defending Cup Series champion Joey Logano and Ross Chastain. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/nascar-2025-race-schedule-results-complete-list-of-cup-series-race-dates-winners-tracks-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks</p>\n                <p>\n                    Steven Taranto                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/15f97dc9-95f6-45f1-85bb-921d85ca29ab/thumbnail/270x152/40d55deb47826fc2fe425a4c2ac8c4d0/gettyimages-2236625210.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Thanks to scoring a good chunk of stage points, Chastain needed to finish only four spots ahead of Logano in order to advance to the next round, but his path towards doing so was complicated by a pair of self-inflicted wounds on pit road. He first cost himself track position by missing the turn at pit exit under caution at the end of stage 1, then put himself in an even worse position when he sped on pit road under green after accidentally leaving his pit box in the wrong gear.</p><p>Shortly after being passed by Chastain, Logano elected to come to pit road with 11 laps to go, giving him slightly fresher tires to try and run down enough cars on a three-stop strategy that he could gain enough points, combined with Chastain losing enough positions and points on older tires, that it would get him to the next round. It took until the final lap, but Logano's strategy would work out, as Denny Hamlin passed Chastain in turn 7 with one lap to go to flip the cut line back in the defending champion's favor via a tiebreaker that Logano held -- and then things got really interesting.</p>\n<p>In a desperation move in the final corner, Chastain lunged into the frontstretch chicane from well back of Hamlin to try and move him out of the way, but ended up spinning himself out along with Hamlin. Chastain threw his car into reverse and backed across the finish line, but by that point it was too late: Logano drove past the incident to finish 20th, which was enough to put him in the Round of 8 while Chastain, along with Tyler Reddick, Bubba Wallace and Austin Cindric, were all eliminated from playoff contention.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone was telling me how close it was gonna be there,\" Logano told USA. \"I knew I was within a point there, and I knew we were gonna be tied there at the end and Ross was gonna do whatever he had to do to make it happen. Just wasn't quite fast enough today with our car, but overall -- man, that's the drama of the playoffs, right? If you want drama, the playoffs bring it every time. What an entertaining finish there for it to come down to basically a tie at the end there before the wreck.</p><p>\"Proud of (crew chief) Paul Wolfe, he made some really hard calls today, three-stopping at the end there. Kind of an audible because our falloff was a little bit too much. Making that call there at the end was ultimately what kept us in the game with just a few left. That was a championship performance from the team. Wish I was a little faster, but overall I couldn't be more proud of the team. We've still got a shot.\"</p><p>Logano will begin the Round of 8 in the deepest points hole of any playoff contender, as he faces a 24-point deficit to the cut line to try and make the Championship 4. But considering his propensity to win in the Round of 8 even in the face of long odds, Logano's presence in the penultimate round of the playoffs is surely terrifying for the rest of the field trying to keep the driver of the No. 22 Ford from his third Cup title in four years.</p>\n<p>Denny Hamlin (+8), Ryan Blaney (+6), Kyle Larson and William Byron (+4) will all begin the next round on the plus side of the cut line to try and be among the four drivers who will race for the Cup championship next month at Phoenix. Christopher Bell (-4), Chase Briscoe and Chase Elliott (-14), and Logano (-24) will all try and avoid the final round of eliminations beginning next week with the start of the Round of 8 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</p>\n<h2>Bank of America Roval 400 results, order of finish</h2><ol><li>#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)</li><li>#5 - Kyle Larson</li><li>#20 - Christopher Bell</li><li>#17 - Chris Buescher</li><li>#71 - Michael McDowell</li><li>#60 - Ryan Preece</li><li>#99 - Daniel Suarez</li><li>#9 - Chase Elliott</li><li>#16 - A.J.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Stephen Curry came out firing in the Warriors' preseason opener on Sunday, rattling off 14 points in 15 minutes before being shut down for the night halfway through the second quarter as Golden State defeated the Lakers, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/gametracker/boxscore/NBA_20251005_LAL@GS/\" target=\"_blank\">111-103</a>. </p><p>Curry got on the board a little more than two minutes into the game in impressive fashion. Jarred Vanderbilt (who looked great for the Lakers, by the way), tried to pressure him 30 feet out and Curry just calmly routed him into a Draymond Green screen and proceeded into the paint for a nifty one-legged finish like he hardly even noticed the defense being played on him. </p>\n<p>It's worth noting this particular bucket because even at 37 years old, we know Curry is always going to be able to shoot, but as long as he keeps this ability to separate downhill against big-time pressure and finish these creative paint shots he will remain an elite scorer. </p><p>Curry finished 5 of 7 from the field and 3 and 5 from 3. He was clearly hunting his shot early and often knowing his minutes were going to be limited. He looked fantastic. Here's the full scoring reel.</p>\n<p>One more play to spotlight out of that package was the give-and-go with Al Horford early in the first quarter -- which highlights the significant impact Horford is going to have on this Warriors team as both a passer and floor-spacer. </p><p>It's a transition possession, and watch as Horford runs straight the short corner. Because he can shoot the 3, the defense (in this case, Bronny James) has to go with him. With Green trailing the play, and thus keeping Lakers center Deandre Ayton occupied 30 feet from the basket, that leaves the paint wide open, so Curry simply hits Horford in the corner and immediately cuts backdoor for an and-one layup. </p>\n<p>The Warriors have perhaps had centers who can make this pass (Andrew Bogut, Kevon Looney), but they have never had a starting-caliber center in the Steve Kerr era who commands this kind of attention as a 3-point shooter. </p>\n<p>You see what it opens up. If that's Looney or Bogut or JaVale McGee or Festus Ezeli or Zaza Pachulia standing behind the 3-point line, the defense just sags into the paint and Curry's path is encumbered. If you do that with Horford (as Jaxson Hayes does here), he just pulls the trigger. </p>\n<p>The threat of Horford's shooting is going to open up loads of interior space for Curry, Jimmy Butler, Brandin Podziemski, Jonathan Kuminga and all the Warriors' penetrators and cutters to finish at the rim without the opposing shot-blocker camped in their way. </p><p>Horford already looked comfortable operating in Golden State's system predicated on waiting for Curry to pop free from a maze of impromptu screens and passes. It's not an easy thing. It requires at once the patience to wait for Curry to emerge and the anticipation to make the read and pass a beat before he actually gets to his spot. It isn't for everyone, but Horford is so smart and skilled that he's clearly going to pick it all up in no time. </p>\n<p>And this is to say nothing of the defensive impact Horford will bring, which we also saw on Sunday. In the few cases that Golden State has enlisted a shooting big man (Quentin Post, Nemanja Bjelica come to mind), it has come at the expense of defense, or when they play Draymond at center it clearly costs them traditional size. </p><p>But with Horford, you get the shooting and passing <em>plus</em> what is still an All-Defense caliber center -- both as a positional defender who can show high and credibly guard on the perimeter and as a rim protector. Within his first four minutes of action, Horford rattled off the assist to Curry, a steal (after jamming up a would-be pick-and-roll before it ever got started) and this blocked shot. </p>\n<p>In his second stint, Horford cut off Vanderbilt's drive before turning his shot away at the rim. </p>\n<p>The margins of NBA lineups are so often about give and take. Someone helps your offense but hurts your defense, or vice versa. Horford, who stuffed the score sheet in 14 minutes with three points, three assists, three blocks, four rebounds and a steal on Sunday, costs you no such compromise. You get everything. And it was all on display in his Warriors' debut.</p>\n            </div>",

The Mariners would've probably understood losing one of the first two games of this series coming in. But, because they were able to win Tarik Skubal's start, they can head into Game 3 with heightened spirits. The Mariners need only to split the two games in Detroit to force a return trip to Seattle.  </p>\n<h2>Game 3 prediction</h2><p>I had the Mariners taking this series, and it's in part because of how much I prefer their rotation to the non-Skubal portions of Detroit's. With that in mind, I think Gilbert will lift the Mariners over the Tigers. Let's call it a 4-1 Seattle win. <strong>Winner: Mariners</strong>. <em>- R.J.

Most of the team remained in Indianapolis this week, however, first for their exit interviews on Thursday and then to be honored by the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. </p><p>Before moving to 4-1 on the season with a dominant 40-6 win over the Oakland Raiders, the Colts welcomed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130759/natasha-howard/\">Natasha Howard</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678028/aari-mcdonald/\">Aari McDonald</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29365965/makayla-timpson/\">Makayla Timpson</a> onto the field and presented them with personalized jerseys. Clark, a noted Kansas City Chiefs fan, declined to actually wear her jersey. </p><figure>\n</figure>\n<p>Clark and company drew loud cheers when they were shown on the jumbotron later in the game. </p>\n<p>The connection between Indianapolis' professional franchises is unique in American sports. The Fever and Indiana Pacers are extremely close thanks to their shared ownership, their recent success and the friendship between Clark and Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton. </p>\n<p>But even though the Colts play a different sport, they're part of the family. Multiple Colts players attended games during the Fever's playoff run, and Colts coach Shane Steichen wore a Fever shirt during a recent press conference. </p>\n<p>\"Anytime all the professional sports can support each other through their certain seasons and come out and show that support and cheer on the other teams, I think it's huge,\" Steichen said. \"I think the players love it. The fans love it. It's a lot of camaraderie back and forth.\"</p><p>While the Fever's season ended in devastating fashion, the team overcame significant adversity to earn the No. 6 seed in the playoffs and win their first playoff game and series since 2015. It would be fitting if the Colts snap their own playoff drought this season, especially after the Pacers also made a run to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> Finals for the first time since 2000. </p>\n<p>The Colts haven't been to the postseason since 2020 and haven't won a playoff game since 2018, but they're on the right path this season. They're off to a 4-1 start and have sole possession of first place in the AFC South. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

At 3-1, Pittsburgh is the only AFC North team that has a winning record at this point in the 2025 regular season. </p><p>Sunday started with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> falling to 1-4 after losing a close game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> in London. During the 1 p.m. window, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> joined the Browns at 1-4 after getting dominated at home against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a>. </p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a>, who opened the season with consecutive wins, fell to 2-3 on Sunday after losing at home to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> during the 4:25 window. </p>\n<p>As you can see, the Steelers now have a sizable lead over the rest of the AFC North field. </p><h2>AFC North division standings </h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br /></th><th><br /></th><th>Record</th><th>Games behind</th><th>Div. record</th><th>Conf. record</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td><p>Steelers</p></td><td><p>3-1</p></td><td><p>-- </p></td><td><p>0-0</p></td><td><p>2-0</p></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td><p>Bengals </p></td><td><p>2-3</p></td><td><p>1.5</p></td><td><p>1-0</p></td><td><p>2-1</p></td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td><p>Ravens</p></td><td><p>1-4</p></td><td><p>2.5</p></td><td><p>1-0</p></td><td><p>1-3</p></td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td><p>Browns </p></td><td><p>1-4</p></td><td><p>2.5</p></td><td><p>0-2</p></td><td><p>0-2</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is now the second straight season where the Steelers have jumped out to an early lead in the AFC North. But after a 10-3 start last season, Pittsburgh ultimately lost the division to Baltimore, who got hot down the stretch before beating the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card round. </p><p>While anything is possible, it's hard to fathom <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-suffer-complete-disappointment-after-34-point-loss-the-second-worst-defeat-of-john-harbaugh-era/\" target=\"_blank\">the injury-plagued Ravens</a></span> making a similar charge this season. Baltimore's injuries, coupled with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrows/\">Joe Burrow's</a> injury and the Browns' continued struggles across the board, have appeared to give the Steelers a clear path towards winning their first division title since 2020.</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh can further increase its odds of winning the North in Week 6, when it hosts Cleveland and rookie quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> in what will be his first career true road start. The Steelers will then face the Bengals in Cincinnati on \"Thursday Night Football\" before hosting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> in Week 8 in what will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a>' first game against his former team. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Here's the language from the NFL rulebook, <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/skycam-interference-rule-was-misapplied-in-cowboys-jets\" target=\"_blank\">per Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk</a>:</p>\n<p>\"[I]f a loose ball in play strikes a video board, guide wire, sky cam, or any other object, the ball will be dead immediately, and the down will be replayed at the previous spot. In the event the down is replayed, the game clock will be reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred ... All penalties will be disregarded, except for personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, which will be administered prior to the replaying of the down.\"</p><p>Florio <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-didnt-have-clear-view-of-vikings-field-goal-striking-camera-cable\" target=\"_blank\">later reported</a> that the NFL didn't have a clear view showing the ball hitting the wire.</p>\n<p>Since Wentz was able to come through clutch via a 12-yard touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a> with 25 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, this officiating mistake did not play a role in the outcome.

It was a salty division. Still is. And I was talking to him about coming to Philly, and he agreed, and he talked about going to Washington and that old stadium. When you play a tough opponent like Philly on the road, I told my team, 'You're gonna forget the money, the car -- all that stuff, but you're not gonna forget, just, these moments.

The former Wyoming standout continues to cement his status as one of the premier players of his generation. In 2024, Allen threw for 3,731 yards and 28 touchdowns against just six interceptions while rushing for 531 yards and 12 scores in 17 games, earning the NFL Most Valuable Player award, along with second-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors.</p><p>Through the first four games of the 2025 season, Allen has thrown for 964 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception, while completing over 70% of his passes and posting a passer rating of 109.7. Over his career, Allen has become known for his powerful arm, athleticism, and ability to make plays both in and out of the pocket. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-bills-vs-patriots-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-sunday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10052025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_BillsPatriotsSNFDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Buffalo running back James Cook. The former Georgia standout delivered a breakout 2024 campaign, carrying the ball 207 times for 1,009 yards and reaching the end zone 16 times, while also contributing as a receiver with 258 yards through the air. He earned his second Pro Bowl nod that season and tied a franchise record for rushing touchdowns in a single season.</p><p>In 2025, Cook has totaled 75 carries for 401 rushing yards, scored five rushing touchdowns, and added 89 receiving yards, ranking among the league leaders in both total yardage and scoring. Over his NFL career to date, Cook has shown rare versatility and explosiveness, accumulating over 3,000 rushing yards, more than 900 receiving yards, and more than 30 total touchdowns. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-bills-vs-patriots-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-sunday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10052025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_BillsPatriotsSNFDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a>:</p><h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for Bills vs. Patriots</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>' vanishing act came in a hurry Sunday against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a>. When the offense took the field for its opening drive of the second half, Los Angeles' 10-0 lead had become a 17-10 deficit in 10 minutes of game time.</p><p>The offensive line would be the next thing to go up in smoke. On first and 10, an unblocked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124180/jordan-magee/\">Jordan Magee</a> came flying in on a blitz, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> quite literally disappeared under a sea of white uniforms and burgundy helmets. It officially went down as a sack by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3169274/johnny-newton/\">Johnny Newton</a>, but any of the four Commanders creating a Herbert sandwich could have been credited.</p><p>No matter. Herbert has bailed the Chargers out plenty of times before, and it looked like he would again, firing a dart to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162609/quentin-johnston/\">Quentin Johnston</a> for 23 yards. The only problem? Right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116462/trey-pipkins/\">Trey Pipkins</a> was called for holding. Instead of a second-and-19 conversion, the Chargers retreated into second and 28.</p><p>And yet there was Herbert again, delivering a 31-yard rainbow to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737096/keenan-allen/\">Keenan Allen</a> to somehow overcome adverse conditions<em> again</em>. The only problem? Stop me if you've heard this before: a flag, this time illegal formation on Pipkins for lining up in the backfield.</p>\n<p>\"We're good enough to overcome some [mistakes], but you need to minimize them,\" Jim Harbaugh said. \"That's an area that we need to get better at.\"</p><p>And now, the Chargers' perfect start -- and status as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> darlings -- has gone AWOL, too. The Chargers fell, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-vs-chargers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-jayden-daniels-justin-herbert/live/\" target=\"_blank\">27-10</a>, to the Commanders on Sunday, and in what's becoming a concerning trend, offensive line play doomed them again. Herbert took four sacks and has taken 16 on the season, tied for second-most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. He was pressured on 38% of his dropbacks Sunday and has faced a 45% pressure rate over the past three weeks.</p><p>The straw has broken the camel's back ... and maybe the Chargers' status as contenders.</p>\n<p>Things began to go awry -- as they seemingly so often do for the Chargers -- in the most painful of ways. Just days after becoming the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-make-lt-rashawn-slater-nfls-highest-paid-offensive-lineman-with-114-million-extension-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history</a></span> a few days into training camp, left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2835704/rashawn-slater/\">Rashawn Slater</a> suffered a season-ending <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-star-lt-rashawn-slater-to-miss-2025-season-after-suffering-torn-patellar-tendon-in-practice/\" target=\"_blank\">torn patellar tendon</a></span>.</p><p>The Chargers cobbled things together by moving <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26713136/joe-alt/\">Joe Alt</a> from right tackle to left tackle, but Alt suffered a high ankle sprain in a Week 4 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>. On Sunday, Pipkins, the fill-in right tackle, and right guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867297/mekhi-becton/\">Mekhi Becton</a>, signed this offseason to fortify the interior of the line, were both in and out of the lineup. Even breakout rookie running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28908905/omarion-hampton/\">Omarion Hampton</a>, handling a workhorse after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741200/najee-harris/\">Najee Harris</a>' season-ending Achilles tear earlier this season, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/omarion-hampton-injury-update-chargers-star-rookie-rb-leaves-game-against-commanders-with-ankle-injury/\" target=\"_blank\">left with an ankle injury</a></span>.</p><p>When the offensive line wasn't an issue, the Chargers operated reasonably efficiently: 5.2 yards per play, nine for 16 on third down and just two punts. Unfortunately, too many of the drives that didn't end in punts didn't end in points, either.</p>\n<ul><li>Up 10-0 early in the second quarter and driving once again, Johnston fumbled at the end of a 19-yard gain.</li><li>Down 20-10 in the third quarter, the Chargers were discombobulated getting out of the huddle on a fourth and 2, and Herbert fired incomplete to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2165249/tyler-conklin/\">Tyler Conklin</a> on a disjointed play. </li><li>Down 20-10 in the fourth quarter, the Chargers drove all the way to the Washington 1-yard line and then went backwards. On third and goal, Herbert's deflected pass got picked off by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121278/mike-sainristil/\">Mike Sainristil</a>. Washington then ripped off a 13-play, 99-yard drive to seal the deal.</li></ul><p>Even with a mishmash offensive line and a significant penalty problem -- 24 for 192 yards over the past two weeks -- Harbaugh said he believes the answers up front are in-house and the issues are fixable. It is only Week 5, after all, Los Angeles is still 3-2 and 3-0 in the AFC West, and Alt could return soon. Herbert has shown he can head an elite offense when he has simply functional support around him.</p><p>\"Concentration, focus in our assignment, our alignment, our technique, all the things that you do as a good football team: things that we have done, that are in our DNA, in our character,\" Harbaugh said. \"When things are happening outside the team's character, [we need] more focus in those areas.\"</p><p>But even he realized that they \"have to get the bleeding stopped.\" Sunday's mistake-filled performance and the M*A*S*H* unit that's trying and failing to protect Herbert showed how quickly things can go from rosy to worrisome in an NFL season.</p>\n<p>The sky isn't falling, but changes and improvement have to happen to ensure these aren't the \"Same Old Chargers,\" a phrase synonymous with a franchise that has seen so many promising seasons go unfulfilled.</p>\n            </div>",

The Chiefs may be playing a different style of football than before, but what they are doing better than ever is protecting the ball. No team entered Week 5 with fewer turnovers than the one Kansas City has on the year, and the team is riding a 39-game win streak when winning the turnover battle, which is the third-longest streak by any team since 1960.</p><p>The Chiefs offense finally broke out last week as the 37 points they put on Baltimore were the most by the team in over two calendar years. In that contest, Mahomes became the fastest player to reach 250 career touchdown passes (116 games), and a good chunk of those have come on Monday nights. He owns a 27:8 TD:INT on Monday Night Football and has torched the Jaguars to historic proportions. Mahomes is the only quarterback since 1950 to be 5-0, or better, versus one team with a 70% completion rate and an average of at least 300 passing yards per game. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/underdog/\" target=\"_blank\">Underdog promo code</a></span>, good for <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\">$100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2</a></em> in select states.</p><h2>Why the Jaguars can cover</h2><p>After ranking dead last in takeaways last season, the Jaguars have done a complete reversal and now lead the NFL with 13 takeaways entering Week 5. Not only that, but they have the best turnover differential (+9) in the NFL, and no stat correlates more with winning and losing than turnover differential. Under first-year defensive coordinator, Anthony Campanile, Jacksonville has the No. 4 run defense, the No. 5 scoring defense and ranks sixth in redzone defense.</p><p>On offense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has been sacked just three times, which is the fewest of any qualified quarterback. The former No. 1 overall pick has also risen to the challenge of being an underdog as he is 5-2-1 against the spread as an underdog over the last two seasons. He's complemented in the backfield by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a>, whose 6.1 yards per carry lead the NFL as the Jags have the No. 4 rushing offense. Their commitment to the run and the ability to produce on the ground game could eat up the clock and keep Mahomes and company off the field. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Chiefs vs. Jaguars picks</h2><p>For Jaguars vs. Chiefs on Monday Night Football, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 45 combined points.

The highest over/under in the NFL odds for Sunday is 49.5 in the Lions vs. Bengals matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups on Sunday include Raiders vs. Colts, Cowboys vs. Jets, and Patriots vs. Bills. Thus, you can expect stars like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Ashton Jeanty, Dak Prescott and Garrett Wilson to be core players in many NFL DFS lineups. </p><p>Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values.

In all, five of the most popular teams in the Circa Survivor picked up victories. Only the Buffalo Bills threw a scare into players before finally disposing of the pesky New Orleans Saints. Week 5 features four teams favored by seven or more points, including Colts (-7) over Raiders, Cardinals (-7.5) over Titans, Lions (-10.5) over Bengals and Bills (-8.5) over Patriots on Sunday Night Football.</p><p>With the survivor pool shrinking, it's a must that players put together a winning NFL survivor pool strategy.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- The only thing that could slow <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29595624/malachi-toney/\">Malachi Toney</a> at Doak Campbell Stadium wasn't <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>'s defense. It was a handshake from a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> legend.</p><p>The Hurricanes' freshman receiver juked, he shook and he outran Florida State defenders on the way to a career night that also served as the dawn of a rising superstar. After the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/gametracker/boxscore/NCAAF_20251004_MIAMI@FSU/\" target=\"_blank\">28–22 win</a> and the obligatory handshakes, Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Irvin stopped Toney near midfield and embraced the phenom.</p><p>\"One of the best freshmen I've <em>ever</em> seen,\" Irvin told CBS Sports after dapping Toney. \"One of the best freshmen we've <em>ever</em> seen. <em>Ever</em>. Not just (now). <em>Ever</em>.\"</p><p>Irvin isn't shy with hyperbole, but as one of Miami's greatest receivers, he knows greatness when he sees it. Toney might just be the best player on the best team in the country, a Miami program that has defeated in-state rivals Florida and Florida State in back-to-back years for the first time since its generational run from 2001 through 2004.</p>\n<p>The smoothest moves belonged to Toney, who stacked up 107 yards and two touchdowns on just seven catches -- all before the fourth quarter. He made No. 18 FSU's secondary look flat-footed, even when the Seminoles were in position to make a tackle. </p><p>A quick slant on fourth-and-2 led to a stutter step upfield after the catch, faking out a safety, which caused the defender to turn his back, allowing for a 40-yard touchdown. A juke on another catch drew gasps from the crowd. His best work didn't count: an illegal motion wiped out a 52-yard catch-and-run capped by a shimmy and a dive at the left pylon along Miami's sideline.</p>\n<p>By the end of the third quarter, Toney had piled up 68 yards after the catch.</p><p>\"If you watch Malachi on his (practice film) dailies, it wouldn't surprise you,\" Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. \"And I don't like handing out praise, especially for young guys like that, but man, if everybody did what Malachi does, their performance levels would go through the roof. He is an early, early, early guy.\"</p>\n<p>On a Saturday in which three top-15 teams fell to unranked opponents -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a> -- Miami stayed upright and Toney soared. The Hurricanes built a 28-3 lead with an explosive passing offense led by quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163129/carson-beck/\">Carson Beck</a>, who threw for 193 of his 241 yards and all four touchdowns before the midpoint of the third quarter. Four completions eclipsed 40 yards, including two touchdown passes to Toney.</p><p>\"He was on fire,\" Cristobal said. \"He did a great job.\"</p><p>The No. 3 Hurricanes (5–0, 1–0 ACC) absorbed FSU's 19-point fourth-quarter surge -- plus two onside kicks -- to reach a deceptive final score. </p><p>But don't let it overshadow the emerging story of Toney, the latest in the long line of elite freshman receivers taking over the sport. Like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a>'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388894/jeremiah-smith/\">Jeremiah Smith</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29419031/ryan-williams/\">Ryan Williams</a> before him, Toney has carved out a spot among first-year greats.</p>\n<p>More impressive? Toney shouldn't even be in a college uniform this fall. The American Heritage alum out of South Florida graduated a year early, <a href=\"https://247sports.com/player/malachi-toney-46136146/\" target=\"_blank\">reclassified as a recruit</a> and enrolled at Miami this past spring.</p><p>Toney's youth shows when he's not wearing a helmet and shoulder pads. He turned 18 years old on Sept. 17, and the braces on his upper teeth flash when he smiles. </p><p>\"From the first time I met him, there's just something different about the kid,\" Beck said. \"I don't know how to explain it, but just the way he carries himself, who he is. He's in the facility nonstop, 24/7.\"</p>\n<p>Toney says his work ethic comes from his mother, Toni Toney, who works at a post office.</p><p>\"Watching my mom get up early for work,\" he said. \"If she can do it, why can't I?\"</p><p>Truth is, Miami knew this was coming back in April.</p><p>CBS Sports shadowed Cristobal during Miami's spring game, when Toney's speed and shiftiness easily garnered him MVP honors. After one big catch, Cristobal turned to this reporter and smiled. The smirk wasn't a pleasantry. It was a warning.</p>\n<p>\"He'll break every record here,\" Miami executive director of football Dennis Smith whispered after a 20-yard touchdown catch in April.</p><p>Five months after Cristobal flashed that smile, he was asked for his thoughts on Toney's performance against the Hurricanes' chief rival.</p><blockquote><div><p>The Miami coach volleyed the question back to the reporter.</p><p>\"What are your thoughts on Malachi?\"</p><p>\"I think he's the best freshman in the country,\" this reporter said.</p></div><p>Cristobal nodded, acknowledging the declaration. </p><p>\"I'm going to tell him that he has a long ways to go and he's got to keep working, but I'm glad that he's impressed you because I know you know your stuff really well.\"</p></blockquote><p>The noise will only increase if Miami and Toney continue on this trajectory. Miami has three ranked wins for the first time since 2009, and the toughest regular-season tests might already be behind them.</p><p>Then again, assume nothing. Every Saturday keeps reminding us that anything is possible. The preseason Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6 -- Texas, Penn State, Clemson and Notre Dame -- are a combined 11-9 heading into Week 7.</p><p>\"I don't think you deny that you have something special going on. I just think you spend your time on assessing and analyzing the things you can get better at because whatever shows on film that you're not good at, it's going to get exposed,\" Cristobal said. \"I don't know what the results of some of the games were today, but when we were headed out of the hotel, it seemed like everybody was about to get upset, because again, it's playoff football now, it's conference games, right? </p><p>\"Everybody's alive. Everybody knows your warts, your holes, your tics. If you refuse to believe that other teams have very good players and very good coaches, if you refuse to acknowledge that the holes that you have need to be fixed in order to keep getting better, you're not going to last very long in this league and this profession.\"</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/bowl-projections-miami-moves-to-top-seed-in-college-football-playoff-bracket-as-penn-state-texas-exit/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Bowl projections: Miami moves to top seed in College Football Playoff bracket as Penn State, Texas exit</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Crawford                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Bowl projections: Miami moves to top seed in College Football Playoff bracket as Penn State, Texas exit\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/05/39bc2cdd-a7d6-49b6-89c7-4a85ce3a24d2/thumbnail/270x152/ab3f62f74d09311d2b8a65771a4eb3d2/miami-bowl-projections.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>As for Toney? He's been consistent from Day 1. He was stellar in his debut in Week 1 against Notre Dame, leading the Hurricanes with six catches for 82 yards and a touchdown. He has at least four catches in every game, up to 375 yards and three touchdowns near the season's midpoint. It's hard to stay anonymous when every catch lands on a highlight reel. Classmates now recognize him on campus, he said.</p><p>\"To be honest, I really don't feed into all that type of stuff,\" he said. \"I just want to stay humble and level-headed — never get too high, too low, just stay consistent.\"</p><p>Toney may tune out the hype, but his mother has joined the chorus. <a href=\"https://x.com/tonichild75/status/1974657918516736434\" target=\"_blank\">Her postgame tweet</a>: Rename Tallahassee to \"Malihassee.\"</p>\n<p>Miami's championship hopes are alive thanks in part to a teenager who should be dreaming about next spring's prom. And the scariest part? Malachi Toney is just getting started.</p><p>\"Now, since you praise him, I've got to push him that much harder all week long,\" Cristobal said. \"So, he'll send you a thank you.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>At his weekly press conference on Wednesday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/\">Drake Maye</a> was asked about the origin of his friendship with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a>, whom he will battle in this week's Sunday Night Football game in upstate New York.</p><p>Maye explained the two quarterbacks share the same agency, Creative Artists Agency. He then continued, \"We share a lot of the same things. We like playing golf. He's very down-to-earth. I like to say I'm down-to-earth.\"</p><p>But Maye didn't mention arguably the most important thing that the two have in common right now: they're both playing winning football. From a statistical standpoint, the similarities between the Patriots' second-year starter and the reigning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> MVP are uncanny. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /></td><td>Drake Maye</td><td>Josh Allen</td></tr><tr><td>Completion pct</td><td>74.0</td><td>70.2</td></tr><tr><td>Passing YPG</td><td>247.0</td><td>241.0</td></tr><tr><td>TD-Int ratio</td><td>7-2</td><td>7-1</td></tr><tr><td>Passer rating</td><td>109.4</td><td>109.7</td></tr><tr><td>Rush TD</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>What in the name of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a> is going on? Simply put, Maye is playing the position at a level not seen in New England since TB12 was in Foxboro.</p><p>Maye has been one of the most accurate quarterbacks in the league through four games. His 74% completion percentage is the best in the NFL and is the second-highest mark for any quarterback through four games in franchise history. Only Brady was better in 2007, where he completed 79.2% of his throws through four weeks (minimum 100 attempts).</p><p>And Maye isn't just taking checkdowns. He's thrown at least two passing touchdowns in the last three games. If he throws for two or more scores against Buffalo on Sunday Night Football, he would become the first Patriots quarterback since Brady in 2017 to throw for multiple touchdown passes in four straight games within a single season.</p><p>Because of Maye's play, SportsLine player prop expert Alex Selesnick has made Maye Over 220.5 total passing yards (-115) on Sunday against Buffalo as <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/four-week-5-nfl-player-props-best-bets-from-sportsline-expert/\" target=\"_blank\">one of his four best player prop bets for NFL Week 5</a>.</p><p>\"Drake Maye is quietly having a very strong season and is coming off a highly efficient performance against Carolina that saw him post an impressive 155.6 passer rating,\" says Selesnick, who is up $2,750 on all prop picks since 2021. \"He'll face a stiffer test against Buffalo on Sunday Night Football, however this game had a healthy 49.5-point total, and the Patriots are 8.5-point underdogs. I was also encouraged by the Patriots' willingness to keep throwing last week despite leading by 28-6 at halftime. I expect that theme to continue as Maye is going to try to keep up with Josh Allen and company.\"</p><p>Maye faces arguably his toughest test of the season in the Buffalo defense. The Bills have the No. 1 pass defense in the league, allowing just 125.8 passing yards per game. They also lead the NFL in opponent's time until pressured (2.4 seconds) and rank second in pressure percentage (45.5%).</p><p>\"They've played together,\" Maye said about the Buffalo defense. \"They jell well. They've got a good scheme. They know what they're doing. They're coached well. So we have a tough challenge.\"</p>\n            </div>"

The Bills are 7-3 over the last five seasons against the Patriots. The model is expecting multiple dominating victories in the Week 5 NFL schedule, including the Lions (-10.5) covering against the Bengals in its Sunday best bets at DraftKings.

Meanwhile, the Bengals have scored only one touchdown in the last two weeks, with Jake Browning taking over for Joe Burrow (toe). The model projects the Lions to cover the spread in 53% of simulations for this 4:25 p.m. ET start.</p><h3>Commanders vs. Chargers Over 47.5</h3><p>Not having Jayden Daniels in the lineup hasn't led to a significant downgrade for the Washington offense, but the Commanders will certainly welcome the return of their electrifying quarterback. Daniels (knee) returns on Sunday after missing the last two games, but the Commanders still averaged 34 points per game without Daniels. The Chargers defense offers a tougher challenge than the Raiders and Falcons, though, and Washington had the No. 6 offense in the NFL last year (28.8 ppg) with Daniels as QB1. Meanwhile, Justin Herbert is off to a strong start with the Chargers, who are more pass-heavy this year than in recent seasons. The Chargers are fifth in the NFL in passing yards per game (249 yards), while Washington ranks 27th in passing defense, allowing 248.5 passing yards per game. The model projects the Over to hit in 58% of simulations.</p><h3>Bills -8.5 vs. Patriots</h3><p>The Bills (4-0) have won three straight games by at least 10 points, and the model projects that trend to continue on Sunday Night Football. Buffalo has won four straight against the Patriots at home, and covered this spread in two of the four contests. The Bills have the No. 2 scoring offense (33.3 ppg) and rank second in yards per contest (404 yards) behind a balanced offensive attack with Josh Allen at quarterback and James Cook leading the backfield. Cook is second in the NFL in rushing yards (401) with at least one touchdown in all four games. Meanwhile, the Patriots (2-2) lost the only game they've played this season against a team that made the playoffs last year, falling to the Steelers, 21-14, at home. Opposing teams are completing 71.2% of passes against New England, the fourth-worst completion percentage against in the NFL, leading the model to project the Bills to cover the spread in 66% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more NFL picks for Sunday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Sunday best bets.

In the Bills vs. Patriots contest, reigning NFL MVP <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a> of the Bills has his passing yards prop set at 225.5. </p><p>Before you play a side on Barkley, Allen or any player prop for Week 5 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The SportsLine expert has gone 27-15 (+1003) in his last 42 NFL player prop picks. Here are his analysis and picks:</p><p>As we've reached our fifth NFL Sunday, we've unofficially entered what I consider the midseason portion of the schedule. With each team having played four games, we're starting to see trends develop, both offensively and defensively.</p><p>With my three favorite bets for today's slate, I'm looking to exploit what I've identified as plus-matchups. It's been a strong start of the season for my picks, so be sure to follow me both on SportsLine and on Twitter/X.</p><h3><strong>Bo Nix Over 32.5 pass attempts (-115, bet365)</strong></h3><p>I believe we'll see plenty of pass attempts from second-year signal-caller Bo Nix. The Broncos call pass plays at the eighth-highest rate in the first half of games and play at the second-highest pace, excluding the last two minutes (data courtesy of Roto Viz). While they typically dial it back in the second half and lean on the run, they might not have that luxury against the undefeated Eagles.</p><p>Three of four opposing quarterbacks have cleared this line against Philadelphia, which is allowing an average of 39.3 quarterback dropbacks per game.</p><p>Sean Payton is not afraid to let his quarterback air it out, and this should be a scenario that calls for it. I'd bet this line up to Over 33.5 attempts.</p>\n<h3><strong>Garrett Wilson Over 62.5 receiving yards (-110, DraftKings)</strong></h3><p>Despite the lean passing offense of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a>, Wilson has continued to produce at a top level. He has cleared this line in three of four games, leading the team in targets, receptions, yards, air yards and pretty much every other receiving metric. This also includes his 47% first-read rate, which leads the entire NFL (via Fantasy Points Data).</p><p>The matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> is perfect. Dallas has allowed the second-most receiving yards per game to opposing first reads (197), on a ridiculous 2.95 yards per route run.</p><p>In a game that figures to be high scoring, it's a smash spot for Wilson, who I have projected close to 80 yards. I'd comfortably bet this to Over 67.5 receiving yards.</p>\n<h3><strong>Rashid Shaheed Over 3.5 receptions (-115, bet365)</strong></h3><p>Shaheed has cleared this line in each of his four games this season. Running a more diverse route tree in head coach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1274372/kellen-moores/\">Kellen Moore's</a> offense, Shaheed's average depth of target of 10.3 yards is significantly less than it was the two previous seasons. Seeing more short and intermediate throws has translated to more target volume for the fourth-year pro.</p><p>Shaheed draws a stellar matchup against a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> secondary that has struggled to defend receivers. The Giants have allowed 15 receptions per game to opposing wideouts, which is the most in the NFL.</p><p>It's a tougher spot for New Orleans tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186637/juwan-johnson/\">Juwan Johnson</a>, who is questionable to play with an ankle injury. The Giants man-heavy scheme also is beneficial for Shaheed, who has the highest target rate on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> against coverage. I'd bet this up to -145.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Alex Pereira returned to the light heavyweight mountaintop, Merab Dvalishvili further solidified his legacy and Jiri Prochazka notched another insane knockout at UFC 320. Saturday's pay-per-view laid the groundwork for interesting future fights.</p><p>Pereira <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-live-updates-results-fight-card-magomed-ankalaev-alex-pereira-2/live/\" target=\"_blank\">demolished Ankalaev</a>, stopping him in 80 seconds, after losing the UFC light heavyweight title to him in March. There's no need for a rematch after Ankalaev failed to rack up a title defense. Fortunately, a worthy contender was in attendance at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. There's also former champion Jiri Prochazka, who demolished Khalil Rountree Jr. after a tough two rounds.</p><p>Dvalishvili already had a case for being the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-merab-dvalishvili-has-chance-to-become-the-true-bantamweight-goat-as-he-runs-roughshod-over-division/\" target=\"_blank\">all-time best bantamweight</a></span>. It's only more compelling after his <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-results-merab-dvalishvili-grinds-through-cory-sandhagen-to-retain-bantamweight-championship/\" target=\"_blank\">decisive decision over Cory Sandhagen</a></span>. If Dvalishvili wants to truly separate himself from fellow bantamweight greats, Dominick Cruz and TJ Dillashaw, there's an appropriate challenge waiting in the wings.</p><p>After an exciting, action-packed night, let's explore the tantalizing fights the UFC can book next.</p>\n<h2>Light heavyweight</h2><p><strong>Alex Pereira vs. Carlos Ulberg:</strong> UFC CEO Dana White revealed, during Saturday's post-fight press conference, that Pereira's team approached him about a heavyweight fight this week. We'll address that next. If Pereira stays put, fighting Ulberg produces guaranteed fireworks. Both men are strikers with knockout power. Ulberg isn't a huge draw, but it's a great booking for a championship doubleheader. </p><p>After beating Ankalaev, Pereira initiated a moment of silence for <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/arthur-jones-dies-at-39-former-super-bowl-winning-defensive-tackle-for-baltimore-ravens-passes-away/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Jones' late brother</a></span>, Super Bowl winner Arthur Jones. Pereira appeared to have another speech planned. Maybe he planned to call out Jones, or the winner of Tom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane. With a lack of compelling heavyweight contenders, Pereira could seemingly move up for a quick one-off while still holding the 205-pound title.</p><p><strong>Magomed Ankalaev vs. Jiri Prochazka: </strong>Prochazka needed Pereira to lose on Saturday. Now, he'll have to contend with staying afloat atop the division. Pereira's two dominant victories over Prochazka make it hard to sell a trilogy. Instead, Prochazka can turn his attention to Ankalaev. It's a fresh matchup with some backstory. Prochazka took issue with Ankalaev mocking him on social media during fight week. Prochazka previously claimed he was offered a title shot against Ankalaev, but turned it down to finish his master's degree. Now is the time to pair them up.</p>\n<p><strong>Khalil Rountree vs. Jan Blachowicz or Bogdan Guskov:</strong> Rountree looked so good for the first 10 minutes of his fight with Prochazka. Unfortunately, if you can't hurt Prochazka, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-results-jiri-prochazka-scores-wild-comeback-ko-over-khalil-rountree-jr-in-light-heavyweight-war/\" target=\"_blank\">he'll ultimately hurt you</a></span>. Rountree has absorbed a disturbing amount of damage between his losses to Pereira and Prochazka. A step backward would be good for him. Former light heavyweight champion Blachowicz and rising striker Guskov meet in November. Rountree will be ranked in proximity to the winner. A fight with Blachowicz gives Rountree a break from KO artists while a fight with Guskov plays into Rountree's strengths against a potentially less elite opponent.</p><h2>Bantamweight</h2><p><strong>Merab Dvalishvili vs. Petr Yan 2:</strong> Dvalishvili wants to set a record four title defenses in 12 months. The UFC should entertain it. The champ wants to fight Yan on Nov. 15. It's unlikely that matchmakers will book a third title fight at UFC 322, but UFC 323 doesn't have one just yet. Yan, a former champion, redeemed himself with three consecutive wins after losing three straight, and is primed for a rematch with Dvalishvili. Yan hasn't fought since July, giving him ample time to recover for the Dec. 6 card.</p><p><strong>Cory Sandhagen vs. Sean O'Malley: </strong>Sandhagen and O'Malley publicly discussed a bantamweight title fight at next year's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/dana-white-says-ufc-will-spend-700000-on-grass-to-fix-the-south-lawn-after-event-at-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">White House card</a></span>. A title fight is off the table, but it's preposterous that these elite strikers haven't fought yet. Now is the perfect time. Both men need a bounce-back fight after losing to Dvalishvili. Whether it's at the White House or not, Sandhagen vs. O'Malley should be booked next. The winner of Marlon Vera vs. Aiemann Zahabi is another appropriate choice.</p>\n            </div>"

UNC went 2-for-11 on third down and dug itself into a hole after Clemson scored 28 points in 16 plays during the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The Tar Heels suffered several defensive miscues and coverage breakdowns in the middle of the field, leading to explosive plays for the opposition. Belichick was blunt on personnel-related questions after watching his defense surrender more than 300 total yards in the opening half.</p><p>\"The guys who deserve to play are going to play. That's all I can tell you,\" he said. \"I'm not going to judge it on how old they are or whatever. My expectations are to come in this week, have a good week and get ready for Cal.

So, when we're behind the sticks it puts us in tough situations.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The NFL can feel random at times as evidenced by the Carolina Panthers' results in 2025. After a 26-10 blowout loss in Jacksonville, the Panthers rallied from a large deficit in the fourth quarter to fall in Arizona, 27-22 in Week 2. Then they followed that up with a crushing 30-0 home win against Atlanta, who was coming off an upset win in Minnesota the week before. In Week 4, Carolina was back to its losing ways, this time in New England, who trounced the Panthers 42-13. Can the Panthers beat the Dolphins in Week 5 as 1-point home underdogs? </p><p>Hitting on an exact NFL score prediction could also result in a huge payday of around 100-1.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>I was the hottest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> expert in the country last week, going a remarkable 14-2 against the spread. The funny part about this was that my two ATS losses came in my top five picks, as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>' offensive line was obliterated in Ireland, while the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a> could not cover the spread in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967590/micah-parsons/\">Micah Parsons</a>' revenge game. But as for those \"Other Week 4 picks\" at the bottom of the article? A perfect 11-0. </p><p>Arguably my best pick last week was taking the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> to defeat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a> straight up as 3.5-point road dogs. They get a chance to build on that momentum this Monday night, as Liam Coen welcomes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> to Duval County. I'm also proud of taking the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> -3.5 vs. the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> -3.5 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, because I know there were a ton of people that identified those lines as potential traps. Nope.</p><p>In Week 5, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> will make his first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> start against a Brian Flores defense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000176/cooper-rush/\">Cooper Rush</a> will look to lead the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> to victory against the 1-3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> and the Eagles will put their perfect record on the line against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nix/\">Bo Nix</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>. Here's a look at what I'm thinking this week. As always, credit to the CBS Sports research team for making me sound smart.</p><p><em>Odds courtesy of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, </em><strong>where new users <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport&sid=cde21da5-6b4e-4820-b8bf-8a7dd7ef5a0b--f1ab\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Top five picks ATS record: 8-12<br />Overall ATS record: 37-27<br />Straight up record: 43-20-1</strong></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> (-1.5)</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>Let's begin with what I feel like is a hot take. Following <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-darts/\">Jaxson Dart's</a> upset of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, Giants +1.5 is probably going to be a popular upset pick. I'm going to say it's a trap.</p><p>The Saints have had some ugly outings this year, but this team is still fighting for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1274372/kellen-moore/\">Kellen Moore</a>. New Orleans trailed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, 21-19, midway through the fourth quarter last week, and set season highs with 189 rushing yards on 5.6 yards per rush. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2082721/alvin-kamara/\">Alvin Kamara</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162256/kendre-miller/\">Kendre Miller</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125863/spencer-rattler/\">Spencer Rattler</a> are the only trio in the NFL to each have 45 rushing yards in every game this season. The Giants allow 153 rushing yards per game, which ranks fourth-worst in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Dart completed 13 of 20 passes for just 111 yards, and registered a touchdown on a shovel pass. He made a legitimate impact on the ground with 54 rushing yards and a touchdown, which is something the Saints defense is going to have to be ready for, but the Giants offense took a hit with the loss of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a>. I never imagined myself making the Saints a best bet this year, but here we are.</p><p><strong>The pick:</strong> Saints -1.5<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Saints 21-14</p><h2>Houston Texans (-1.5) at Baltimore Ravens</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>The headline of this matchup has to be the Ravens' injuries, as it looks like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> won't be under center on Sunday. That's not all, as cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139775/marlon-humphrey/\">Marlon Humphrey</a>, linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180472/roquan-smith/\">Roquan Smith</a> and safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3136877/kyle-hamilton/\">Kyle Hamilton</a> did not practice on Thursday -- plus <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2249188/nnamdi-madubuike/\">Nnamdi Madubuike</a> has already been ruled out for the season. Defensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961384/travis-jones/\">Travis Jones</a>, pass rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961253/odafe-oweh/\">Odafe Oweh</a>, offensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2005667/ronnie-stanley/\">Ronnie Stanley</a> and cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26699779/nate-wiggins/\">Nate Wiggins</a> were limited participants, so we'll see what happens with them. </p><p>The Texans have the No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL this year, allowing 12.8 points per game. The offense ranks No. 29 (16 points scored per game), but maybe they got back on track following the 26-0 blowout of the lowly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a>. Keep an eye on rookie running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171045/woody-marks/\">Woody Marks</a>, who racked up 119 yards from scrimmage and scored two touchdowns on 21 touches last week. </p>\n<p><strong>The pick:</strong> Texans -1.5<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Texans 17-14</p><h2>Tampa Bay Buccaneers at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> (-3)</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>I was down on the Seahawks entering this season, and laughed when they fell to the banged-up 49ers at home in Week 1. However, Seattle has been playing well. I did not expect the Seahawks to beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> like they did in Week 2, they destroyed the New Orleans Saints in Week 3 then found a way to win in Arizona after blowing a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks are also one of just two teams to allow 20 points or fewer in all four games this season.</p><p>The Buccaneers are absolutely a feisty team, but this roster is so injured that <a href=\"https://x.com/PewterReport/status/1973420482604179711\" target=\"_blank\">they couldn't even practice on Wednesday</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> didn't practice on Wednesday with knee and right biceps injuries, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/\">Bucky Irving</a> is expected to miss time with a foot injury and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> should miss another game with a hamstring issue. </p><p>Health is the most important factor in this matchup. The Bucs are banged-up traveling across the country, while the Seahawks got a mini-bye after playing on Thursday last week. </p>\n<p><strong>The pick:</strong> Seahawks -3<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Seahawks 24-17</p><h2>Tennessee Titans at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> (-8.5)</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>Even though I'm 37-27 ATS this year, my top picks haven't been incredible (8-12). Half of those wins have come from whichever team is playing the Titans.</p><p>I have made fading the Titans a best bet EVERY SINGLE WEEK, and I'm 4-0. This team is bad, and I don't know how much I have to explain that. Brian Callahan gave play-calling duties to Bo Hardegree last week, and Tennessee put up zero points for the first time since 2019. I understand 8.5 points is a lot for a team like the Cardinals which still has yet to reach 300 yards of total offense in a single game this year, but Cameron Ward's top receiver, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186328/calvin-ridley/\">Calvin Ridley</a>, did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday due to knee and elbow injuries. The Titans are on the road for the second straight week, while the Cardinals are at home for the second straight week and coming off a mini bye. </p><p><strong>The pick:</strong> Cardinals -8.5<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Cardinals 20-7</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> at Los Angeles Chargers (-2.5)</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox, Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fubo</strong></a><strong>, try for free)</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> is back for the Commanders, but he wasn't dominating teams when healthy. In fact, Washington is averaging 19.5 points per game with Daniels under center and 34 points per game with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1880862/marcus-mariota/\">Marcus Mariota</a> at quarterback. Obviously I'm not saying Mariota is better than the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, but this Commanders team struggled out of the gates. They also don't have wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139279/terry-mclaurin/\">Terry McLaurin</a> in the fold due to his quad injury. </p>\n<p>As for the Chargers, it's not great that they are now down their top two offensive tackles, but keep in mind the Commanders don't have a pass rush like the Giants do. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herberts/\">Justin Herbert's</a> passing attack can pick apart Washington's secondary, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28908905/omarion-hampton/\">Omarion Hampton</a> has finally arrived. He racked up 165 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown last week. The Chargers are 15-5-1 ATS under Jim Harbaugh since the start of last season, which is tied for the best mark in the NFL.</p><p><strong>The pick:</strong> Chargers -2.5<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Chargers 23-20</p><h2>Other Week 5 picks</h2><p>Rams (-8.5) 27-13 over 49ers<br />Vikings (-3.5) 13-6 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a> (+1.5) 20-17 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a><br />Colts 27-21 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> (+6.5)<br />Eagles 23-20 over Broncos (+4.5)<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> (-2.5) 24-18 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> (-10.5) 28-14 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a><br />Bills 24-20 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> (+8.5)<br />Jaguars (+3) 26-24 over Chiefs</p>\n            </div>",

No. 1 teams collapsing. Pregame scuffles. Miami's mascot cuffed by police. Nothing in sports -- or in daytime soap operas -- matched the chaos of the real-life drama that unfolded every fall in Miami and Tallahassee from 1985 to 1994.</p><p>Seven straight top 10 clashes, including four as top-five teams. Legends were born, heartbreak branded into history: Wide Right I and II, the Game of the Century. Two quarterbacks -- Miami's Gino Torretta and Florida State's Charlie Ward -- won the Heisman Trophy. Four national titles were claimed -- three for the Hurricanes and one for the Seminoles. For a decade, the road to glory ran through Tallahassee and Coral Gables.</p><div><p>\"The amount of violence on the field was unmatched,\" said Torretta.</p><p>\"You can't even describe how much fun it is to play in that game,\" said Devin Bush, whose pick six sealed a 28-10 win against No. 3 Miami in 1993.</p></div><p>On Saturday, the stakes are real again. No. 3 Miami and No. 18 Florida State meet as ranked foes for the first time in nine years, serving a long-awaited reminder of what this rivalry once meant ... and could mean again.</p>\n<p>It begs the question: Do the players in the rivalry today understand the past and just how inherently tense the Miami-FSU rivalry was for so many years in the Sunshine State?</p><p>\"They have no idea,\" surmised former Miami offensive tackle Leon Searcy, a three-time national champion. \"Social media may give them an opportunity where they can go back and forth about the game, but I don't think they realize how intense it is unless you go back and do your research.\"</p><p>Miami-FSU might not hold the same intensity as the heydays of Bobby Bowden vs. Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson -- heck, ESPN's \"College GameDay\" skipped Tallahassee this week for Vanderbilt-Alabama -- but the fans certainly remember the past and remain passionate about their 'Noles and 'Canes. In many ways, the fans have kept the flame burning, weaponizing their nostalgia into one of the most entertaining and downright vicious spats on social media.</p>\n<figure><p><img alt=\"bowden-erickson.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/03/e6427e4b-4259-4f90-a71f-765665d69495/resize/670x377/f7e34f6567e22b93baa501fe38acdb6e/bowden-erickson.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>Bobby Bowden and Dennis Erickson were two legendary coaches who helped define this rivalry.  </span><span>\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>In the absence of 'Wide Right' drama, top 10 showdowns and runs to the national championship, the rivalry has shifted online. 'Noles Twitter vs. 'Canes Twitter is a 24/7 bloodsport, a modern echo of the bulletin board days of yesteryear when the entire sport turned their attention to the state of Florida for this one Saturday in the fall.</p><p>Their memes are outrageous -- some not safe for work -- and their arguments get downright personal, carrying through the late nights on X and spilling over into live \"Spaces\" events in which the fan bases talk trash in real time. GIFs like Miami defensive lineman Kendrick Norton sacking FSU's James Blackman, and then strumming his leg like a guitar, are prevalent.  </p><p>Miami fans secured new ammunition when then-No. 8 FSU fell in double overtime to unranked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a> on the road last week. Images of a Virginia fan flipping the bird to quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875815/tommy-castellanos/\">Tommy Castellanos</a> provided a new template for trash talk.</p>\n<p>\"I had somebody ask me if I think Florida State is going to look past Virginia,\" FSU social media personality TJ Pittinger said. \"I was like, 'Buddy, I don't think these kids care about playing Miami like you think they do. They care more about Miami being a top-five team than the stuff that happened in the late '80s. I don't think these kids give a s--t about that.'\"</p><p>Indeed, even the coaches have tamped down the trash talk in the modern age. Miami's Mario Cristobal, who was in the thick of the war and won two national championships as a lineman between 1989 and 1992, has focused more on preparation.</p><p>\"We always knew this as the best rivalry in football. Coming up as a player, that was always a reason why players chose to go to one of the two respected schools,\" Cristobal told reporters this week. \"I mean, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> is the best sport in the world, so the fact that people bring up historical moments and whatnot, it's not surprising. I do think that our players, alumni bases, fans, they all understand how intense this rivalry is, but I think our players, more importantly, understand the importance of practice and preparation, and that's what our focus is right now.\"</p>\n<p>Certainly, behind closed doors, those words are more pointed and sharp. Cristobal grew up in an age when Jimmy Johnson declared the days leading up to the Florida State game as \"No Class Week.\" Players skipped classes to study film at 9 a.m. at the football facility, where they remained for the entire day.</p><p>\"If you had a test, you told a coach and the coach would get it switched,\" former Miami center Kelvin Harris said. \"That's just Jimmy. That's how Jimmy ran it.\"</p><p>Gone are the days of a roster sticking together for four to five years. Yes, 57 players on Florida State's roster hail from Florida, and Miami has 54, but the transfer portal has led to frequent roster churn every offseason. Miami added 19 transfers and FSU had 23 in the offseason. Both quarterbacks -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163129/carson-beck/\">Carson Beck</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>) and Castellanos (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BC/boston-college-eagles/\">Boston College</a>).-- started at other schools in 2024.</p>\n<p>\"I tell these kids now making all this money, listen, 10 or 20 years from now, ain't nobody gonna remember how much money you made at school. But if you bring the school championships, that's what makes legends,\" Searcy said. \"You make all that money and then you're going to be forgotten in two or three years, but if you leave a legacy …</p><div><p>\"There ain't nowhere in Miami I can walk without someone saying, 'What's up, Big Searce?'\"</p><p>Echoed Bush: \"We were with our teammates from freshman all the way through as seniors. We did all the dirty work, the stuff that doesn't feel good: running in your vomit together, holding each other up, pushing. We had that relationship and camaraderie.</p></div><p>\"In the offseason, my teammate Derrick Brooks and I would work out and we talked about nothing but Miami when we lifted weights.\"</p>\n<p>In the early 1990s, Miami coaches were kicked out of the team meeting room on Thursday night before the game as former players filtered into the room to impart words of wisdom -- and plenty of colorful language.</p><p>\"No one knew who it was going to be. They would speak it real,\" former Miami linebacker Maurice Crum said. \"It got to the point where the guys were so fired up, people would be in tears. We wanted to play that night.\"</p><p>While it can be argued that the constant roster movement via the transfer portal has cooled the vitriol among players, it has actually intensified the chatter among fan bases online. Miami fans consider Cristobal the sport's Portal King. FSU fans argue in favor of Mike Norvell, who has leaned heavily on the transfer portal in recent years to varying degrees of success, leading the 'Noles to an ACC title in 2023 before faltering to a two-win campaign in 2024, the program's worst season in nearly 50 years. FSU has bounced back again, thanks, in part to the addition of superstars like Castellanos from the portal.</p>\n<p>\"In the offseason, people really started to get on (X),\" said \"Touchdown Timothy,\" a prominent figure on Miami Twitter. \"I launched a blog during the pandemic out of boredom, and it took off. People ask me if 'Touchdown Timmy\" is a character. I just say, every person is playing a character to some degree.\"</p><p>Said Pittinger, an FSU fan: \"They literally overpay for guys that the other one is recruiting just to have a recruiting win and piss the other one off.\"</p><p>The fan bases feed off the missteps and failures of their rivals. Feverish attitudes have always been present on game days, but now they are featured online 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p>\"The fans were super nasty, but I loved it,\" Bush said. \"They're shooting you birdies, calling you all types of names, but when you're riding in on the bus, it's nobody but you. There's no help. I remember one year they came up and tore up our visitor locker room. It's a real rivalry. Let's go! It's a rivalry you're supposed to get into. There's supposed to be severe trash talk. You're supposed to get into shoving matches. There's bad blood. That's supposed to happen.\"</p><p>FSU fan Darren Dukes, known as \"Jaguar Paw\" on social media, fondly remembers a rally from a 16-0 deficit to defeat the Hurricanes 30-26 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. \"Miami fans were waking out crying. They were literally crying. Grown me crying!\" Dukes said. \"Me? Hey, I was laughing.\"</p><p>Dukes is in full troll mode online. He believes Miami fans are among the cockiest on the planet. \"Their fan base can be unbearable,\" he said.</p>\n<p>But that didn't stop the South Florida native from dating Miami receiver Leonard Hankerson's mother for nine years, he said. Hankerson is now the receivers coach for the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>\"We get along really good. Sometimes he'll send me a text that 'we're going to beat y'all.' But I always supported him when he was at The U,\" Dukes said.</p><p>They may not admit it, but Florida State and Miami share more in common than most other rivalries.

Whatever we've got to do to prepare, that's what we're doing. Whether it's hitting hard in practice or attacking physicality every day, it's all going to boil down to who wants it more.\"</p><p>No. 18 Florida State (3-1, 0-1 ACC) can't afford to start 0-2 in league play after last week's 46-38 double-overtime loss at Virginia. Whether the Seminoles looked ahead to Miami doesn't matter now — what is clear is that FSU must play its best game of the season to beat a rejuvenated Hurricanes squad built on perhaps its strongest offensive and defensive lines in two decades.</p>\n<p>Saturday also marks the first road test of the season for No. 3 Miami, which hasn't left the state of Florida through the first two months. Still, the Hurricanes may not face a tougher environment than what awaits them this weekend at Doak Campbell Stadium.</p><h2>Miami vs. Florida State: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Florida State's offense is a beast:</strong> The Seminoles still lead the nation in total offense, averaging 53 points and 600 yards per game. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875815/tommy-castellanos/\">Tommy Castellanos</a> also tops the FBS in yards per attempt at 12.1 -- the best four-game stretch by an ACC quarterback since Philip Rivers in 2002. FSU is pounding teams on the ground, too, averaging 336.3 rushing yards per game, the most of any non-Academy program. The production will need to carry over against Miami. The Seminoles haven't beaten a top-three team since the 2014 BCS National Championship, when they took down <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> -- then coached by Gus Malzahn, now FSU's offensive coordinator.</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163129/carson-beck/\">Carson Beck</a> is back:</strong> After catching criticism at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> last season despite completing 65% of his throws, Beck has thrived at Miami. His Bulldogs receivers led the nation in drops; at Miami, his targets are finishing plays, and he's up to a 73% completion rate while averaging 8.7 yards per attempt. With better protection and a run game producing 56 more yards per contest than Georgia's group last year, Beck has looked in full command. He enters Saturday with a 28-3 record as a starter, the most wins by any quarterback since 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>It's been a while:</strong> This is the first ranked meeting between Florida State and Miami since 2016, a long drought for a rivalry that once dominated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>. Saturday marks the 26th matchup between the programs as AP Top 25 teams — 22 of which came between 1982 and 2006. Miami is already 2-0 against ranked opponents this season.</p><h2>How to watch Miami vs. Florida State live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Doak Campbell Stadium -- Tallahassee, Florida<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ABC| <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>Miami vs. Florida State prediction, picks</h2>\n<p>Florida State should have beaten Virginia, but played catch up last week after two early turnovers led to a 14-0 deficit.

That's what the White Out is for the No. 7 Nittany Lions no matter who it is against, much less the No. 2 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> team they faced last week in prime time after three tune-up games. </p><p>That game ended in a result that is all too familiar -- James Franklin and Penn State faltering when the lights were brightest. Now, it's time to turn the page to a different challenge: getting up for a maybe 15% full Rose Bowl against a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> team that is now without the head coach, offensive and defensive coordinators it started the season with after an 0-4 start. </p><p>The Nittany Lions should beat the Bruins easily (if they don't, it raises serious red flags about their season moving forward), but assuming they do, Penn State has three questions to answer over the next few games before their next key stretch against No. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> and No. 8 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>, provided they can navigate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> successfully to close out October. </p><p><strong><em>Watch Penn State vs. UCLA live Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/big-ten-football?ftag=CBS-03-10adg7j\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, the <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/QeYaC8MVDqb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a>. </em></strong></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/the-cold-hard-facts-dont-care-about-james-franklins-feelings-and-he-knows-it/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>The cold, hard facts don't care about James Franklin's feelings -- and he knows it</p>\n                <p>\n                    Richard Johnson                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"The cold, hard facts don't care about James Franklin's feelings -- and he knows it\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/28/71e33377-0788-49c0-b7db-e29912f1791b/thumbnail/270x152/984ab1456cbe08ae82d53e38d934597c/jamesfranklin.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Is this who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> is? </h2><p>The most troubling thing is not only has Drew Allar's development seemingly stalled, it's that it has done so in spite of what Penn State has put around him in order to be successful. Allar and the Penn State passing game got all new toys this offseason with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26720252/kyron-hudson/\">Kyron Hudson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26703014/devonte-ross/\">Devonte Ross</a> and post-spring addition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168420/trebor-pena/\">Trebor Pena</a> from the transfer portal. Mix that with another year in Andy Kotelnicki's offensive system, and the overwhelming expectation for Allar was improvement, but it hasn't happened and he's out of excuses. </p><p>In each of Penn State's games against AP top six opponents -- AKA the hump Penn State cannot get over -- in which he has started, it is the offense, more specifically the passing game, that has let the Nittany Lions down. The passing game still lacks explosiveness, and it still does not meaningfully attempt to push the ball down the field vertically. Despite new pieces, it still does not pose a credible threat. Penn State is 116th in the country in percentage of passes of 20+ air yards and 74th in air yards per target. It would be nice to just chalk that up to three cupcake opponents to start the season, but he had only one such pass against Oregon out of nine passes 20+ yards down the field. </p><p>Penn State's defense has done all it reasonably could in five of those, excluding the Big Ten Championship Game against the Ducks last season. Eventually, a player is what he is, and despite late-game heroics running the ball to tie the game last weekend, Allar still leaves way too much to be desired in big moments.</p>\n<h2>Can Nick Singleton get it in gear?</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875485/kaytron-allen/\">Kaytron Allen</a> has been giving you what you'd expect from the backfield so far this season, but his running mate, Nick Singleton, is just a bit off the pace so far this season. He has five rushes over 10 yards in 52 total carries. All of them came in the second and third games of the season against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NOVA/villanova-wildcats/\">Villanova</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FIU/fiu-panthers/\">FIU</a>. Especially if Allar and the passing game continue to struggle, it's going to fall to Allen and Singleton to get things going for the offense. So far this season, he's been unable to give them the explosive element they desperately need. </p><h2>Who is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123940/tony-rojas/\">Tony Rojas</a> replacement?</h2><p>Thankfully, Penn State does have two opponents that aren't going to test them, because finding a suitable replacement for Tony Rojas is going to be a process after the inside linebacker went down with an undisclosed injury in practice this week. Dom DeLuca is the natural successor; you might remember him from his two interceptions in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff game against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SMU/smu-mustangs/\">SMU</a>. But freshmen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29269671/alex-tatsch/\">Alex Tatsch</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29734848/cam-smith/\">Cam Smith</a> may also see the field in what would be the first snaps of their young careers on defense. Tatsch played sparingly against Villanova and Smith is yet to see the field. Both could play against UCLA or Northwestern if Penn State handles business as expected. </p><p>This is a program with a proud lineage at the position. The second level will have to be ready for what's to come in November. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> had a chance to take down a division rival and move into sole possession of first place on Thursday night, but instead, they came up empty after making several huge mistakes during the late stages of their 26-23 overtime loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p><p>The Rams, who were favored by 8.5 points, became an upset victim because they couldn't get out of their own way in the fourth quarter. Although <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> threw for 389 yards and three touchdowns, it wasn't quite enough to overcome the Rams' costly errors. </p><p>Let's cover the three biggest errors that the Rams made from the fourth quarter and overtime. </p><h2>The Rams gave up another blocked kick</h2><p>The Rams trailed 20-7 in the third quarter, but thanks to Stafford, they were quickly able to erase that deficit. The Rams quarterback threw a touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> in the third quarter to cut the lead to 20-14. In the fourth quarter, it looked like the Rams were going to take a 21-20 lead after Kyren Wililams caught an 8-yard scoring pass, but that didn't happen, because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-kartys/\">Joshua Karty's</a> extra point got blocked. </p>\n<p>The block by the 49ers kept the score knotted at 20 with 10:39 left in the game. The Rams field goal team has had a serious problem with protection this year. This extra point attempt marked the third time since Week 3 that Karty has had a kick blocked and the painful part is that all three blocks have come in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Karty also missed a 53-yard field goal in the game, so special teams cost the Rams a total of four points. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a>' fumble in the fourth quarter</h2><p>With just 2:52 left to play and the Rams trailing 23-20, Los Angeles took over possession at its own 35-yard line with a chance to tie or win the game. </p>\n<p>Matthew Stafford quickly drove the Rams into scoring position on a drive where he completed two passes for 29 yards. After a 20-yard run from Kyren Williams, the Rams quickly found themselves on the cusp of scoring a possible go-ahead touchdown with a first-and-goal at San Francisco's 3-yard line. However, they ended up getting ZERO points on the drive because Williams fumbled the ball away at the 1-yard line. </p>\n<p>The fumble was forced by 49ers rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/\">Alfred Collins</a> who threw a perfect punch at the football to knock it loose. If Williams had scored a touchdown, it would have put the Rams up 27-23 with just 1:05 left to play, but instead, the 49ers took over possession at their own 1-yard line. </p><p>The Rams did force a three-and-out on the ensuing 49ers' drive and Stafford then quickly drove his team into field goal range to force overtime after Karty nailed a 48-yard kick. </p>\n<h2>Errant kickoff to start overtime </h2><p>Karty didn't get to celebrate his game-tying field goal for very long, because, on the first play of overtime, he made a brutal mistake. When Karty kicks off, he generally hits a knuckleball and that had been working well all night until the game got to overtime. In the extra session, Karty got penalized because his kickoff didn't make it to the landing zone. The penalty set the 49ers up with the ball at their 40-yard line. </p><p>From there, the 49ers didn't have to drive very far to get in field goal range. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> ended up taking them 37 yards to set up Eddy Pinero's 41-yard field goal that proved to be the game-winning points. </p><h2>Sean McVay admits his 'poor' play call cost his team the game</h2><p>Under this year's overtime rules, both teams are guaranteed one possession, so the 49ers had to kickoff to the Rams after Piniero's field goal. The Rams took over at their own 33-yard line and Stafford immediately drove them 56 yards down to San Francisco's 11-yard line, where they eventually faced a fourth-and-1. </p>\n<p>At that point, Rams coach Sean McVay had two options: He could kick the field and tie up the game or he could go for the first down. The usually conservative coach decided to go for it and that decision backfired after he called a run up the middle. </p>\n<p>Williams never had a chance. </p><p>After the game, McVay was asked about the play call and he was clearly frustrated with himself. </p><p>\"The play selection was very poor,\" McVay said. \"I'm sick right now because I put our players in a shitty spot and I have to live with that.\"</p>\n<p>Stafford was on fire in the fourth quarter and overtime, throwing for a total of 194 yards. The Rams had a six-play drive in overtime and the first five plays were all passes. With Stafford playing so well, it probably would have made sense to put the ball in his hands, but McVay had Williams run up the middle. </p><p>If you want our full takeaways from the 49ers win, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-vs-49ers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-as-san-francisco-surprisingly-controls-first-half/live/\" target=\"_blank\">we've got those here</a>. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><em>Once again CBS Sports presents our annual Candid Coaches series, which spotlights relevant topics and issues in men's college basketball. Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander polled roughly 100 coaches in recent weeks on a variety of subjects. Coaches spoke on background and were provided anonymity to offer unfiltered opinions. This is the second installment in our 2025 survey.</em></p><hr /><p>The House Settlement that took effect this summer generated a lot of money for attorneys and also returned something akin to recruiting regulations to college athletics. In theory, each Division I athletic department now has up to $20.5 million to spend on athletes however it sees fit. In theory, name, image and likeness deals that were more or less unlimited in recent years are now supposed to be scrutinized with anything that looks more like pay-for-play than actual NIL disallowed.</p><p>In other words, there are rules again.</p><p>The days of coaches getting a group of boosters to stack money so that they can deliver it to a prospect in exchange for nothing more than his commitment are supposed to be over. But are they? With that in mind, Matt Norlander and I decided to ask more than 100 college coaches the following question:</p><h2>Assuming there now is what amounts to a salary cap in college athletics, do you trust that your competitors will recruit within the rules?</h2><p><strong>No:</strong> 89%<br /><strong>Yes:</strong> 11%</p><h2>Quotes that stood out</h2><p>From coaches who answered \"No.\"</p><ul><li>\"I do not trust that most high-level competitors will stay within the rules. There is too much at stake. Personally, I would rather it be that way. It allowed opposing coaches to know who they were recruiting against and make the decision to stay involved or not.\"</li><li>\"No. That has never happened.\"</li></ul><ul><li>\"Absolutely not. I don't think there's one coach who's going to say we're going to follow the pillars of the NCAA constitution, get the f-ck out of here.\"</li><li>\"No, everybody will attempt to be as creative as they can to skirt the rules and gain a competitive advantage. There will also be a lack of oversight & governance.\"</li><li>\"No, at least not 100%. Until we have a governing body that can enforce rules and levy out 'real' punishments, those who have always found a way or 'cheated' will continue to do so.\" </li><li>\"We are in the SOUTH region of the United States. There are no rules, only getting wins. Let's be real.\"</li><li>\"I do not trust our competitors to recruit within the rules at all. (We are in the SEC, remember). And a fair salary cap at our level should be around $8 to $10 million per roster.\"</li><li>\"No. The precedent has been set over the last couple of years with how recruiting has been done. Now they have even more of a direct line to donors/money-people.\" </li><li>\"No. If you get more than two people to say yes, you should cancel all their other answers. It's too competitive. We live in a competitive environment. Coaches are going to do what they need to get players.\"</li><li>\"Hell no. Ask [Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve] Ballmer!\"</li></ul><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-school-made-the-best-college-basketball-coaching-hire-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Candid Coaches: Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Candid Coaches: Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/628b336b-f010-49c6-90a5-69bd162b4c9e/thumbnail/270x152/a1f8a422a4a637f9254c41fdca1612ee/cc-oct1-v2-1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>From coaches who answered \"Yes.\"</h2><ul><li>\"I think you have to [follow the rules now]. In my opinion, this isn't five to 10 years ago -- when programs had to figure out how to hide a $10,000-to-$50,000 payment. You are [now] talking about hiding <em>hundreds of thousands of dollars</em>, and in some cases <em>millions</em>. Maybe I am naive, I just don't see how people will hide that amount of money.\"</li><li>\"I believe that at the low/mid-major level there will be adherence to the rules because of lack of funds/opportunity to go beyond.\"</li><li>\"Do I think 51% of the guys will follow these rules? Yes. Do I think 80%? That's pushing my optimism.\"</li></ul><h2>The takeaway<br /></h2><p>The answers here illustrate something I've been writing and talking about since before the House Settlement even became a reality -- that a salary cap in college basketball, particularly a salary cap in college basketball that will differ for different programs even in the same conferences, was never going to work as currently constructed. Think about it: When the salary cap was effectively zero for decades and decades and decades, cheating was rampant in recruiting with ambitious coaches trying to create advantages and beat-down coaches just fighting to keep up.</p><p>So why would any of that change now?</p><p>Hard caps are still hard caps.</p><p>And the same types of coaches who used to bust right through them before will simply bust right through them again, by any means necessary, after making the assessment that the possible reward -- i.e., wins, championships and millions of dollars in contract extensions -- outweighs any perceived risk.</p>\n<p>It's an accurate assessment.</p><p>Think about all of the coaches who have gotten into trouble for so-called cheating over the past decade. I don't have to name them. You know who they are. Now think about how many of them still have the jobs they had or have recovered nicely with similar or even better jobs. In this sport, cheating has never ended careers as much as losing does. So every set of rules ever created has been broken over and over again by countless individuals for as long as rules have existed. And I always figured the return of what amounts to recruiting rules, after a brief period of anything-goes, would lead to the return of strong-ass offers and under-the-table payments.</p><p>As you can see, coaches agree.</p><p>Nearly nine out of every 10 coaches we asked told us they do not trust their competitors to recruit within the rules -- and, it should be noted, only one high-major coach polled disagreed. One high-major coach actually told me he doesn't believe his competitors will follow the new rules because he already knows <em>he's</em> not going to follow the new rules.</p><p>\"You know what conference I work in,\" the coach said. \"How much do you think we're winning if I'm following these new rules? And here's the other thing: At least before, we all knew the rules, and then we could decide whether or not to break them. But now the rules are confusing. People either don't understand them or don't believe in them. And none of us believe anybody is really following them. It's messy.\"</p><p>Yeah, it's messy.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/house-v-ncaa-settlement-quells-issues-in-college-sports-no-but-be-prepared-for-a-whole-new-type-of-chaos/\" target=\"_blank\">As I've explained before</a></span> -- <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/arkansas-ad-hunter-yurachek-frustrated-with-state-of-recruiting-suggests-breaking-rules-might-be-needed/\" target=\"_blank\">including as recently as last month when Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yuracheck basically co-signed what coaches told us</a></span> -- based on the way the rules are written, once some power-conference athletic departments spend, in some cases, roughly 75% of their $20.5 million in revenue-sharing on their football programs, there should be Big East men's basketball programs, and even some Atlantic 10 men's basketball programs, with more money to roster-build than various SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC men's basketball programs.

The Nittany Lions are coming off a heartbreaking double-overtime loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> last weekend and will look to bounce back against one of the few winless teams in the FBS. </p><p>The Nittany Lions started the season 3-0 with wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEVADA/nevada-wolf-pack/\">Nevada</a>, FIU and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NOVA/villanova-wildcats/\">Villanova</a> before facing their first-ranked opponent of the 2025 campaign. With the loss to Oregon, Penn State coach James Franklin dropped to 2-21 during his tenure when facing an opponent ranked in the top six of the AP Top 25 poll. </p><p>UCLA entered this season with a significant amount of hype after landing former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/\">Nico Iamaleava</a> via the transfer portal. The Bruins fired their former coach, DeShaun Foster, last month following an embarrassing loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NMEX/new-mexico-lobos/\">New Mexico</a> at home and are one of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/predicting-every-winless-college-football-teams-first-victory-will-ucla-nico-iamaleava-upset-a-big-ten-foe/\" target=\"_blank\">just four FBS teams that haven't won a game this season</a></span>. </p><h2>Penn State vs. UCLA: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Penn State has an opportunity to get back on track:</strong> The Nittany Lions missed a marquee opportunity to steal a game at home after being down by double digits in the fourth quarter against Oregon. A win over the Ducks in a rematch of last season's Big Ten title game would've changed the trajectory of the entire season, but Penn State will have to turn the page fast with an interesting stretch of games upcoming starting with a cross-country trip to Southern California.</p><p><strong>UCLA's OL vs. Penn State's DL is the matchup to watch:</strong> This game will be won (and lost) in the trenches. Penn State has a stout defensive line headlined by star edge rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28891492/dani-dennis-sutton/\">Dani Dennis-Sutton</a>. In total, seven different players on the Nittany Lions' roster have recorded at least one sack this season. Meanwhile, Iamaleava has been one of the most pressured quarterbacks in the Big Ten this season. If Penn State's defensive line can get home, it could be a long day for the Bruins.</p>\n<p><strong>UCLA is on the wrong side of a dreadful stat: </strong>The only team in the FBS that hasn't led at any point this season is UCLA. After losing by 65 points combined during its first three games, UCLA showed fight against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a> last weekend. The Bruins mounted a comeback and had a chance to send the game to overtime on their final drive, but time ran out. UCLA's final drive -- which lasted 1:29 -- netted just a single yard on five plays.</p><h2> Where to watch Penn State vs. UCLA live </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location</strong>: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.<br /> <strong>TV: </strong>CBS | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/big-ten-football?ftag=CBS-03-10adg7j\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/QeYaC8MVDqb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a><br /> <strong>Streaming on</strong> <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a></p><h2> Penn State vs. UCLA predictions, pick<br />  </h2>\n<p>Penn State is coming off an emotional loss, while UCLA is searching to lead in a game for the first time this season. Something will have to give on Saturday. Penn State's defense should be able to get pressure on Iamaleava, which could make it a long day for UCLA's offense. However, look for the Bruins to cover. They're coming off their best showing of the season against Northwestern. Penn State will win this game, but won't cover the nearly four-touchdown spread. <strong>PICK: </strong><em><strong>UCLA +26.5</strong></em></p>\n<div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n

The Crimson Tide looks to avenge last season's stunning loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a> and the Commodores that marked Vanderbilt's first win <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/vanderbilt-qb-diego-pavia-sounds-off-on-alabama-matchup-if-we-play-our-game-it-wont-be-close/\" target=\"_blank\">over a then-No. 1 ranked team</a></span>. </p><p>Alabama is coming off a momentum-building win at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> that pushed the Crimson Tide back inside the top 15 of the polls and was the team's third straight victory since a season-opening loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>. Vanderbilt's red-hot under fifth-year coach Clark Lea, winning its five games by an average margin of 31.8 points. </p><p>One of the SEC's top passers this season, Pavia has thrown for 1,211 yards and 13 scores while leading his team in rushing with 294 yards. At Alabama, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> has 11 touchdown passes and hasn't thrown an interception this season as a first-year starter, completing throws at a 69.3% clip. </p><p>The Commodores' last win over the Crimson Tide in Alabama came in 1950 when the two programs played in Mobile. Alabama leads the all-time series, 60-20-4, after last year's loss in Nashville snapped a 23-game winning streak. </p>\n<h2> Alabama vs. Vanderbilt: Need to know </h2><p><strong>Turnover margin:</strong> The only Power Four team without a turnover this season, Alabama is plus-7 in turnover margin. Vanderbilt has suffered four giveaways -- three interceptions and a fumble -- through five games, but is plus-5 in the department overall. Getting after Pavia and keeping him under duress will be key for the Crimson Tide's defense after Vanderbilt's top playmaker gashed this unit last season. </p><p><strong>Third-down success rate:</strong> Two of the SEC's best at moving the chains, Vanderbilt and Alabama rank No. 2 and 4, respectively, in the league on third down -- much of that due to stellar play at the quarterback position. Commodores tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26696120/eli-stowers/\">Eli Stowers</a> has several first-down receptions and leads his offense with 22 catches on the year for 301 yards. The triple-threat of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878358/germie-bernard/\">Germie Bernard</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29419031/ryan-williams/\">Ryan Williams</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28933166/isaiah-horton/\">Isaiah Horton</a> for the Crimson Tide have combined for nine total touchdowns and one of those three is often targeted by Simpson on third down. </p><p><strong>Kalen DeBoer's record vs. top 25 teams:</strong> After Alabama's win over Georgia last week, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/every-power-four-coachs-career-record-against-the-ap-top-25-a-deep-dive-into-why-this-history-matters/\" target=\"_blank\">DeBoer improved to 16-3 as a coach against nationally-ranked competition</a></span>, which leads the SEC. Right now, Vanderbilt is one of five ranked teams left on the slate for the Crimson Tide, who is seeking their first playoff appearance since Nick Saban's final game in the 2023 College Football Playoff semifinals. </p>\n<h2> Where to watch Alabama vs. Vanderbilt live </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location</strong>: Bryant-Denny Stadium -- Tuscaloosa, Alabama<br /> <strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free) </p><h2> Alabama vs. Vanderbilt prediction, picks<br />  </h2>\n<p>Has Alabama finally hit its stride under DeBoer? If the last three games are any indication, this team is heating up at the right time and has erased worries that came out of opening weekend in Tallahassee. Simpson's been elite and more wins moving forward means he'll have a say in the Heisman picture. The Commodores rank near the middle of the SEC in explosive plays allowed this season, so that's a statistic to watch against a Crimson Tide team with plenty of talent at wideout. Alabama rebounds to avenge last season's loss, but Pavia and Vanderbilt will keep it competitive. ... <em><strong>The pick: Vanderbilt +10.5.</strong></em></p><div><table><thead><tr><th><br

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> had a chance to take down a division rival and move into sole possession of first place on Thursday night, but instead, they came up empty after making several huge mistakes during the late stages of their 26-23 overtime loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p><p>The Rams, who were favored by 8.5 points, became an upset victim because they couldn't get out of their own way in the fourth quarter. Although <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> threw for 389 yards and three touchdowns, it wasn't quite enough to overcome the Rams' costly errors. </p><p>Let's cover the three biggest errors that the Rams made from the fourth quarter and overtime. </p><h2>The Rams gave up another blocked kick</h2><p>The Rams trailed 20-7 in the third quarter, but thanks to Stafford, they were quickly able to erase that deficit. The Rams quarterback threw a touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> in the third quarter to cut the lead to 20-14. In the fourth quarter, it looked like the Rams were going to take a 21-20 lead after Kyren Wililams caught an 8-yard scoring pass, but that didn't happen, because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-kartys/\">Joshua Karty's</a> extra point got blocked. </p>\n<p>The block by the 49ers kept the score knotted at 20 with 10:39 left in the game. The Rams field goal team has had a serious problem with protection this year. This extra point attempt marked the third time since Week 3 that Karty has had a kick blocked and the painful part is that all three blocks have come in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Karty also missed a 53-yard field goal in the game, so special teams cost the Rams a total of four points. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a>' fumble in the fourth quarter</h2><p>With just 2:52 left to play and the Rams trailing 23-20, Los Angeles took over possession at its own 35-yard line with a chance to tie or win the game. </p>\n<p>Matthew Stafford quickly drove the Rams into scoring position on a drive where he completed two passes for 29 yards. After a 20-yard run from Kyren Williams, the Rams quickly found themselves on the cusp of scoring a possible go-ahead touchdown with a first-and-goal at San Francisco's 3-yard line. However, they ended up getting ZERO points on the drive because Williams fumbled the ball away at the 1-yard line. </p>\n<p>The fumble was forced by 49ers rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/\">Alfred Collins</a> who threw a perfect punch at the football to knock it loose. If Williams had scored a touchdown, it would have put the Rams up 27-23 with just 1:05 left to play, but instead, the 49ers took over possession at their own 1-yard line. </p><p>The Rams did force a three-and-out on the ensuing 49ers' drive and Stafford then quickly drove his team into field goal range to force overtime after Karty nailed a 48-yard kick. </p>\n<h2>Errant kickoff to start overtime </h2><p>Karty didn't get to celebrate his game-tying field goal for very long, because, on the first play of overtime, he made a brutal mistake. When Karty kicks off, he generally hits a knuckleball and that had been working well all night until the game got to overtime. In the extra session, Karty got penalized because his kickoff didn't make it to the landing zone. The penalty set the 49ers up with the ball at their 40-yard line. </p><p>From there, the 49ers didn't have to drive very far to get in field goal range. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> ended up taking them 37 yards to set up Eddy Pinero's 41-yard field goal that proved to be the game-winning points. </p><h2>Sean McVay admits his 'poor' play call cost his team the game</h2><p>Under this year's overtime rules, both teams are guaranteed one possession, so the 49ers had to kickoff to the Rams after Piniero's field goal. The Rams took over at their own 33-yard line and Stafford immediately drove them 56 yards down to San Francisco's 11-yard line, where they eventually faced a fourth-and-1. </p>\n<p>At that point, Rams coach Sean McVay had two options: He could kick the field and tie up the game or he could go for the first down. The usually conservative coach decided to go for it and that decision backfired after he called a run up the middle. </p>\n<p>Williams never had a chance. </p><p>After the game, McVay was asked about the play call and he was clearly frustrated with himself. </p><p>\"The play selection was very poor,\" McVay said. \"I'm sick right not because I put our players in a shitty spot and I have to live with that.\"</p>\n<p>Stafford was on fire in the fourth quarter and overtime, throwing for a total of 194 yards. The Rams had a six-play drive in overtime and the first five plays were all passes. With Stafford playing so well, it probably would have made sense to put the ball in his hands, but McVay had Williams run up the middle. </p><p>If you want our full takeaways from the 49ers win, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-vs-49ers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-as-san-francisco-surprisingly-controls-first-half/live/\" target=\"_blank\">we've got those here</a>. </p>\n            </div>"

The former Stanford standout's 2024 season was hampered by injuries, limiting him to just four games in which he logged 50 carries for 202 rushing yards (4.0 average) and added 15 receptions for 146 receiving yards, but he did not score any touchdowns. In 2025 so far, across three games he's totaled 52 carries for 176 yards (a 3.4-yard average) and 25 catches for 213 yards, managing to find the end zone once as a receiver. </p><p>Over his career, McCaffrey has been widely recognized for his versatility and production: he's amassed over 6,500 rushing yards, 4,600 receiving yards, and more than 80 total touchdowns, while earning multiple Pro Bowl nods and winning the 2023 NFL Offensive Player of the Year award. When healthy, he's easily one of the most complete backs in the league, blending elite pass-catching skills with power and elusiveness out of the backfield. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-rams-vs-49ers-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-thursday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_TNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Play at Underdog Fantasy and get $100 in site credits after making a $5 wager</em></a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. The former BYU standout has quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most dangerous weapons at wide receiver. In 2024, despite missing time to injury, he still hauled in 79 receptions for 990 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 12.5 yards per catch. </p><p>In 2025, Nacua leads league with 29 catches for 333 yards and one touchdown.

Furthermore, the ruling said the arbitration clause as a whole -- in which Goodell could rule over disputes involving his own conduct -- has \"procedural and substantive unconscionability.\"</p>\n<p>The Nevada Supreme Court judges did not rule on whether Gruden's claims are true or not.</p><p>The NFL <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jon-gruden-vs-nfl-lawsuit-league-to-appeal-nevada-supreme-court-ruling-to-allow-suit-to-proceed/\" target=\"_blank\">appealed the ruling</a></span>, as expected, shortly after it was delivered. Now, however, the league's appeal to rehear the decision has been denied. The NFL can appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the Supreme Court hears very few cases per year. The NFL had hoped that this lawsuit would go to arbitration to avoid potentially damning details becoming public, but it is rapidly running out of options. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/someone-will-give-him-a-chance-why-jon-grudens-desire-to-coach-college-football-shouldnt-be-ignored/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>'Someone will give him a chance:' Why Jon Gruden's desire to coach college football shouldn't be ignored</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brandon Marcello                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"'Someone will give him a chance:' Why Jon Gruden's desire to coach college football shouldn't be ignored\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/15/82e51ea6-4ad1-4172-96b5-c9f6c28c64cc/thumbnail/270x152/b654f175e382cbe120f2c86bb6c7a892/jon-gruden.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal first uncovered a 2011 email between Gruden and then-Washington team president Bruce Allen in which Gruden <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nflpa-raiders-investigating-jon-gruden-regarding-use-of-racist-remark-about-demaurice-smith-in-2011-email/\" target=\"_blank\">used a racist trope</a> when discussing then-NFLPA president DeMaurice Smith, who is Black.

Purdy is the most notable injury, but even as Mac Jones steps in after going 2-0 as a starter this season, he'll be without two key playmakers who aided him in those victories with Jauan Jennings﻿﻿﻿ (ankle/ribs) and Ricky Pearsall﻿﻿﻿ (knee) both out. The 49ers remain without Brandon Aiyuk, who has been on IR all season with a knee injury, leaving Jones with limited options. San Francisco defeated the Saints and Cardinals in one-score victories with Jones, and a road matchup against the 3-1 Rams will be a significantly tougher challenge. The Rams are a blocked field goal away from a 4-0 start as well, and as the significantly healthier team, the model favors Los Angeles for a more comfortable victory. The model projects the Rams to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>New Mexico State (+114) to defeat Sam Houston</h2><p>The home team has won each of their two meetings over the last two seasons, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Thursday. New Mexico State defeated Sam Houston, 27-13, in 2023 before falling in this matchup, 31-11, in Texas last year. But Sam Houston is off to an 0-4 start this season, while New Mexico State is 2-2. New Mexico State is one of the most pass-heavy teams in the nation, and the unit can capitalize on Sam Houston's weaknesses with the strategy. Sam Houston ranks 131st of 136 teams in passing yards allowed (321.8 yards per game), while ranking 127th in completion percentage against (70.34%). New Mexico is 28th in the nation in passing yards (274 per game) behind fifth-year quarterback Logan Fife. The Aggies have three different receivers with more than 200 yards this season as well. The model projects an upset on Thursday, with New Mexico State winning in 54% of simulations, projecting strong value at plus-money odds.</p><h2>Yankees (-158) to defeat the Red Sox</h2><p>The Yankees were one of the hottest teams in baseball to close the regular season, winning eight straight games and 11 of 12 contests to finish 94-68 on the season. New York finished five games ahead of Boston (89-73) this season, behind the No. 1 offense in baseball (5.21 runs per game). Aaron Judge, the favorite to win the AL MVP, is 4-for-8 this postseason after leading baseball in categories such as batting average (.331) and OPS (1.144). Although both the Yankees and Red Sox are starting rookies, New York has the experience advantage on the mound with Connelly Early, 23, making just his fifth career start for Boston. Yankees starter Cam Schlittler, 24, went 4-3 with a 2.96 ERA in 14 starts this year. New York went 50-31 at Yankee Stadium, while Boston was just 41-40 away from Fenway Park. The model expects the Yankees to take advantage of homefield advantage, projecting New York to win in 65% of simulations. </p><h2>Want more MLB picks and Thursday Night Football picks for Thursday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Thursday best bets.

Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.</p><p>Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 5 of the 2025 NFL season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-nfl-week-5-projections-from-proven-model-that-outperformed-experts/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_Week5FFrankings\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>Top Week 5 Fantasy football picks </h2><p>One surprise in Week 5: The model is fading Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith, a two-time 1,000-yard wideout who has been a top-30 Fantasy receiver each of the last three years. Much has been made about A.J. Brown's lack of involvement in Philly's offense, but Smith has been just as much as a non-factor. He's had 60 or fewer receiving yards in every game this season and has just one touchdown. He's averaging just five targets per game and is coming off a two-catch, 29-yard performance versus Tampa.</p><p>Smith has eight fewer targets than Brown this year, and dating back to last season's playoffs, Smith hasn't reached 70 yards in eight straight games. In Week 5, he'll face a top-10 passing defense in the Broncos, who have also allowed the fewest passing touchdowns (one) in the NFL. Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins combined for just 55 yards versus Denver on Monday night, and only one wideout all year has eclipsed 68 receiving yards against the Broncos. Thus, Smith may not warrant a spot in Week 5 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in positional rankings.</p><p>Another curveball: The model is high on Colts quarterback Daniel Jones. The former Giant has four passing and three rushing touchdowns on the season as he enters Week 5 as the QB8 in Fantasy points. He may be even higher if Colts wideout, Adonai Mitchell, wouldn't have fumbled on the 1-yard-line on Sunday with a premature celebration, taking away another potential passing score for Jones. The quarterback is among many who have found success after leaving New York, as Jones has career highs in passer rating, yards per game and completion percentage.</p><p>The Raiders' defense awaits Indy in Week 5, and Vegas has a bottom-10 pass defense on the season. All four quarterbacks the Raiders have faced have at least 200 passing yards and a passing score, so there's a high Fantasy floor whenever playing Las Vegas. Additionally, just seven teams have allowed more rushing yards to opposing quarterbacks than Vegas, which plays into one of Jones' strengths. He checks in as a top-three Fantasy QB for Week 5, slotting ahead the likes of Patrick Mahomes and Dak Prescott.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO</span> -- If you're not a white-knuckled partisan of either team -- chair arms firmly and punishingly clenched -- then the ninth inning of NL Wild Card Series Game 3 between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> is what you want out of playoff baseball. In the deciding game of the series, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-wild-card-2025-cubs-padres-game-3-live-updates-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">won 3-1 by the host Cubs</a>, the final inning provided intensity and drama worthy of October. It also merits revisiting as the Cubs prepare to duel with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Milwaukee Brewers</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/brewers-vs-cubs-nlds-schedule-prediction-odds-division-rivals-meet-for-first-time-in-mlb-playoffs/\" target=\"_blank\">in the Division Series</a></span> and the narrowly vanquished Padres begin their offseason. </p><p>It began with the Cubs up 3-0 and reliever <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/\">Brad Keller</a> on the mound for his second frame of work after not appearing in Wednesday's loss. Per basic win expectancy, the Cubs had a 96.8% chance of winning and closing out the series. Even before a pitch was thrown, it never felt that secure. </p><p>It certainly didn't after the third pitch was thrown, a low-and-inside 1-1 changeup from Keller that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26719676/jackson-merrill/\">Jackson Merrill</a> lashed for a home run to right-center and the Padres' first run of the game. This season, 14 of Merrill's 16 regular-season home runs came against right-handers like Keller. Counsell still had a lefty in the pen available, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2164751/taylor-rogers/\">Taylor Rogers</a> pitched in Game 2 and has generally struggled this season when working back-to-back days. </p>\n<p>The next crucial moment of the top of the ninth came with a full count on the next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945481/xander-bogaerts/\">Xander Bogaerts</a>. Keller placed a 3-2 fastball near the lower outside corner of the zone and catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044542/carson-kelly/\">Carson Kelly</a> snatch-framed it for a called strike three. Those watching via the magic of color-television saw it as an egregious miss on the part of plate ump D.J. Reyburn: </p>\n<p>\"Looked down to me,\" Padres manager Mike Shildt said after the game. \"You know, but I don't see great, and I am kind of far away. But most importantly, Bogey felt like he was down. He is not a guy -- you know, not any of our guys really, but Bogey in particular is not a guy that's overly dramatic about close pitches. It's a big pitch. It's a big swing pitch. You know, it turns the tying run and what would have unfolded after that could have been very impactful, but we had other opportunities, too.\"</p><p>Had this same pitch happened next year, Bogaerts surely would've tapped his helmet to challenge the pitch under the forthcoming ABS system. And just as surely it would've been ball four instead of strike three. Right? Maybe. However, Statcast graded the pitch as strike: </p><figure><p><img alt=\"bogaertspitch.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/03/4a1adeac-65af-4b67-9c64-c4e87e1e74d6/resize/670x377/6080b81958f203ee684b303254046025/bogaertspitch.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Baseball Savant\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>So maybe not, given that Statcast has better inputs than the K zone on your TV. The strike zone remains a many-splendored thing. The end result, though, is that the Padres instead of having the tying run at the plate with no outs had the bases empty and one out. For whatever it's worth, absent the fractured finger that sidelined him for this series, hot-hitting deadline addition Ramón Laureano probably would've batted in this spot. </p>\n<p>What happened next may have momentarily helped the Padres get past that potential missed call. Keller overcooked a 2-2 fastball and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211177/ryan-ohearn/\">Ryan O'Hearn</a>. Then a 1-2 changeup got away from him and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837044/bryce-johnson/\">Bryce Johnson</a>'s foot. That put the potential tying run on and thus brought the potential go-ahead run up in the person of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447496/jake-cronenworth/\">Jake Cronenworth</a>, and at that point Counsell went to right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2228478/andrew-kittredge/\">Andrew Kittredge</a>, who'd pitched in both Games 1 and 2 of the series. </p><p>That led to the next fraught moment of the inning: </p><p>The challenge was a worthy one given the moment, but Cronenworth was indeed out despite what seemed to be a brief hesitation on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153549/matt-shaw/\">Matt Shaw</a>'s part before making the throw across the diamond. The Padres, no doubt, were left wondering what if Bogaerts had gotten that call above and the bases had been loaded. Is Shaw positioned differently, so as to make the play easier or harder? Does he start a 5-4-3 instead? Or does the change in base-out state change the pitch selection and thus the batted-ball outcome altogether? Unknowns abound, except in reality where it was two on two out and a two-run margin. </p><p>With the game on the line, Freddy Fermín put a good swing on a first-pitch sinker from Kitteredge but got just a bit under it. He hit hard, but the high launch angle made it peter out at 354 feet and into the able glove of Cubs center fielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>. Like Cronenworth's batted ball, Fermin's had an expected batting average of just .170, and again the Padres were on the short end of the odds. </p>\n<p>As it was in the ninth, it was for the series from the San Diego standpoint -- just the wrong angle, the wrong bounce, the wrong flip of the coin. </p>\n            </div>"

The Jays rested up this past week while the Yankees had to battle the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> in a tough three-game series in the Bronx. They prevailed, though, and we get to see a Yankees-Blue Jays playoff series. If that sounds rare to you, it is. In fact, this is the first-ever playoff meeting between the two AL East foes.</p><h2>Yankees vs. Blue Jays schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time</th><th>TV</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sat., Oct. 4</p></td><td><p>4:08 pm ET</p></td><td><p>FOX</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sun., Oct. 5</p></td><td><p>4:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>FOX</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 3</strong></td><td>Tues., Oct. 7</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 4 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Wed., Oct. 8</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 5 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Fri., Oct. 10</td><td>TBD</td><td>FOX</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Yankees vs. Blue Jays: Game 1 info</h2><ul><li><strong>Time</strong>: 4:08 p.m. ET | <strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Rogers Centre -- Toronto</li><li><strong>TV channel</strong>: FOX | <strong>Live stream</strong>: Fubo.tv</li><li><strong>Starting pitchers</strong>: TBD</li><li><strong>Odds</strong>: Yankees +104, Blue Jays -122 | O/U: 7.5</li></ul><h2>Game 1 storylines</h2><p><strong>Yankees</strong>: The Yankees will look to avoid using their bullpen as much as they can and that's the area for opponents to exploit.

The Yankees have a ton of offensive firepower, but only scored nine runs in three games with two homers in the first round. They'll be looking to bust loose here.</p><p><strong>Blue Jays</strong>: The Blue Jays have the advantage in this one due to getting to start whichever pitcher they want while the Yankees have to use their No. 4 starter.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After ending a four-year playoff drought in 2022 by winning the AFC South title with a 9-8 record, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> finished with the same mark the following season but placed second in the division and did not qualify for the postseason. Things went south for the team last year as they went 4-13 and were without quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> for seven games due to a shoulder injury and a concussion.</p><p>As a result of the dismal season, there was an overhaul to the coaching staff. Head coach Doug Pederson was fired and replaced by former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> offensive coordinator Liam Coen, while new offensive and defensive coordinators were brought in.</p><p>The changes appear to be working, as the Jaguars enter their matchup with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> on Monday Night Football in Week 5 of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> for first place in the AFC South with a 3-1 record. Jacksonville's only loss was a 31-27 road setback against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in which it allowed the game-winning touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Kansas City, which was embarrassed last February by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in its quest to become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls, began this campaign with back-to-back losses against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> and Eagles. The disappointing start led many to wonder if the team's dominance in the AFC West was coming to an end.</p><p>But the Chiefs seem to be turning things around as they posted victories over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> to even their record at 2-2. Thanks to New York's triumph over Los Angeles in Week 4, Kansas City is just one game behind the division-leading Chargers, and its chances for a 10th straight division title are very much alive.</p>\n<p>With both teams entering their Monday night showdown having posted back-to-back wins, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes Jacksonville and Kansas City each have a solid chance to make the playoffs. But its projection model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is more confident in the Chiefs as it sees them reaching the postseason well over 84% of the time and the Jaguars in just over 57% of its simulations.</p><p>The ITL team's model has crunched the numbers for Monday's contest at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville, as well as every NFL game for the remainder of the season, and its simulations say a loss by the Chiefs wouldn't be devastating to their playoff outlook. Should it drop to 2-3, Kansas City's postseason chances would drop to just over 69%.</p><p>According to the model, the Chiefs qualify for the playoffs in almost 88% of its simulations with a victory, making it less than a 19% difference between a win and a loss. However, the model says Jacksonville's difference would be more significant, as the Jaguars's playoff chances would increase to almost 71% with a victory but fall to just under 48% with a loss on Monday night.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFS</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>TEAM</p></td><td><p>CURRENT</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 5 WIN</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 5 LOSS</p></td><td><p>DIFFERENCE</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jacksonville Jaguars</p></td><td><p>57.2%</p></td><td><p>70.7%</p></td><td><p>47.7%</p></td><td><p>23.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kansas City Chiefs</p></td><td><p>82.4%</p></td><td><p>87.9%</p></td><td><p>69.3%</p></td><td><p>18.6%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Meanwhile, neither club's chances for a division title are very good at the moment, as they both are just under 33%, and will get worse by more than 10% with a loss on Monday. The model sees Kansas City's chances dropping to less than 23% with a loss and Jacksonville's dipping below 28%.</p><p>With a victory in Week 5, the model says the Chiefs win the AFC West in more than 38% of its simulations.

But they haven't fared well anywhere against the Chiefs of late, losing each of the last eight meetings between the teams -- including in the 2022 AFC Divisional Round of the playoffs.</p><p>Kansas City defeated the Jaguars 17-9 in Jacksonville when the teams most recently met in Week 2 of the 2023 season. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> threw for 305 yards and a pair of touchdowns while Lawrence completed only 22-of-41 pass attempts for 216 yards as Jacksonville was limited to three field goals.</p><p>Both clubs are looking to record a third consecutive victory, but it would be more helpful to the Jaguars when it comes to the playoff hopes of both teams. Kansas City is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251006_KC@JAC/\" target=\"_blank\">consensus odds</a>, and the ITL team's model is leaning toward a cover by the Chiefs, projecting them to register a 25-20 win.</p>\n            </div>"

It's rough to see the impact his departure has had on Dallas' pass rush, and it's been a rough start for the Cowboys' secondary in terms of their adjustment to new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' zone heavy coverage scheme in 2025 after years of operating in high rates of man coverage under Dan Quinn (2021-2023) and Mike Zimmer (2024). </p><p>It's also rough to see Dallas felt the need to bench two-time Pro Bowl cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252834/trevon-diggs/\">Trevon Diggs</a> at the start of their Week 4 matchup against the Green Bay Packers on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Diggs did end up playing a starter's allotment of snaps, 49, a message was sent to the 27-year-old Diggs by Eberflus and head coach Brian Schottenheimer. </p><p>\"A rough week,\" Diggs said Wednesday, avoiding getting into specifics on the disciplinary problem. \"I guess coach is holding me accountable, and I accepted it, it's cool. But you know, back on track this week ready to work.\"  </p>\n<p>When asked if a bad week of practice led to his benching, Diggs responded sarcastically, \"Yeah, sure.\"  </p><p>Diggs confirmed the plan is for him to start in Week 5 at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a> (0-4). He's fresh off one of his best games of the season, allowing just one catch on two targets for negative-three yards in the 40-40 tie against the Packers. </p><p>\"I think it's early in the season,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday. \"The decision with Trevon like I talked about the other night, I expect a lot from him, and I stay on him about his consistency. I thought he played really well [against Green Bay]. I told you guys how proud I was of him. They're both doing really good things. But as a whole, as a football team, as a defense, as a team, we're not doing enough to win. But both guys are special players that we're very fortunate to have.\"  </p>\n<p>Not doing enough to win for Dallas' defense has manifested itself in a number of ways for the league's 31st-ranked scoring defense. The Cowboys' 40.2% team quarterback pressure rate with Parsons on the roster from 2021-2024 was the best in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in that span. Without him this season, Dallas possesses a 33.3% QB pressure rate, tied for 21st in the NFL. Losing the pressure that Parsons created the last four years has transformed Dallas into the NFL's worst third-down defense, allowing opponents to move the chains on 58.2% of their third-down opportunities. Not being able to speed up opposing quarterbacks has put the Cowboys' secondary into positions where it has to cover longer, and with both cornerback Diggs (knee) and cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2830003/daron-bland/\">DaRon Bland</a> (foot) not at 100%, that's been a major issue. '</p><p>\"It's about the rush and the coverage. ... It [the QB pressure rate] hasn't been what we need it to be,\" Eberflus said on Thursday.    </p><p>Dallas has also spent the fifth-most time trailing (2:39:03) in the league this season, a situational factor that also impacts the pass rush according to Pro Bowl defensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079670/kenny-clark/\">Kenny Clark</a>, Dallas' leader in quarterback pressures (14) this season. </p>\n<p>\"We get teams to drop back and pass, truly drop back and pass, the [pressure] numbers will go up,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"We just got to do that. We fall behind 14-0 every game, it's tough to do that when teams are play-actioning and running the ball, and they got control of the game. If we can actually get up and get ahead and be able to play downhill like that, I think our [pressure] numbers will go up.\"</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Cowboys Defense NFL Ranks, This Season</th><th><br /></th><th>NFL Ranks</th></tr><tr><td><p>PPG Allowed</p></td><td><p>33.0</p></td><td><p>31st</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total YPG Allowed</p></td><td><p>420.5</p></td><td><p>32nd</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yards/Play Allowed</p></td><td><p>6.4</p></td><td><p>31st</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3rd Down Pct Allowed</p></td><td><p>58.2%</p></td><td><p>Last</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>QB Pressure Pct</p></td><td><p>33.3%</p></td><td><p>T-21st</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sacks</p></td><td><p>5.0</p></td><td><p>T-26th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Passer Rating Allowed</p></td><td><p>123.0</p></td><td><p>31st</p></td></tr><tr><td>Takeaways</td><td>2</td><td>T-26th</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Another issue is when in coverage, Dallas' secondary has been out of position. Their five passing touchdowns of 20 or more air yards this season are the most in the NFL. All of them occurred across Week 2 and 3 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a>. It's an improvement that they didn't surrender any against Green Bay quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a>, whose 8.3 yards per pass attempt average is the fourth-highest in the NFL. </p><p>\"Just getting accustomed to the system and where the routes are going to be, where the routes are going to end up. Putting yourself in position to make plays,\" Diggs said when asked what he meant by saying they have to collectively work on positioning. \"I wouldn't say it's [zone coverage] more complex, but when you're playing man, you're right there with the person. You're literally right there. He goes over the field, you go over the field too. Then, you're covering an area. You have to cover an area and then be in position to make a play. So I feel like it just comes with repetition, getting a feel for it. As the weeks have been coming, it's been getting way easier, way easier. I feel like we're on our way to getting the ball and on our way to making plays.\"</p><p>Eberflus chalked up positioning as simply getting lined up quickly through knowledge of the play call and a sense of urgency to be positioned well before the ball is snapped despite Diggs' perception of positioning being more scheme related. </p><p>\"I would say that putting guys in position and then getting lined up and getting ready to go. The ball is ready, we have to be ready. Get your cleats in the grass and get ready to go. That's the biggest thing because a ready defense is a good defense. That's the best way to go.\"</p><p>Diggs, whose 20 career interceptions are the second most in the NFL since he entered the league in 2020, said he's talked with defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus about running more man coverage. Dallas is currently running man on 6.2% of their defensive plays, the lowest rate in the league according to TruMedia, while simultaneously running zone on 87.5% of their plays, the highest rate in the league according to TruMedia. Eberflus' ideal defense is to have his front four defensive linemen generate the pressure that creates chaos and turnover worthy plays for an offense while the other seven defenders drop back into zone. </p><p>\"It's comfortable being uncomfortable,\" Diggs said of the use of more man coverage. ... \"Yeah, we talk, but at the end of the day it's not about what I want. It's not about what other people want, it's about what the whole defense wants, what [Eberflus] wants and what coach thinks is best for us to win. If he feels like this gives us our best chance to win, we got to play it and play it to the best of our abilities, it's not to point fingers at nobody, it's nobody's fault, we just got to execute.\"  </p><p>Eberflus appreciated Diggs' input, but he emphasized the team just needs a little more time to gel. </p><p>\"I value everybody's opinion. That's important that you do that as a coach, and you listen. That's important that you do that too. We're growing as a group. There's improvement in the play. We just got to keep growing as a group.\"   </p><p>It's worth noting that Diggs clearly still hasn't looked 100% since returning from his second knee procedure in as many years in 2025, and 2023 All-Pro cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2830003/daron-bland/\">DaRon Bland</a> missed Weeks 2-3 with a foot injury. </p><p>\"It's been in and out consistency wise with players. Guys have been hurt. Bland was down. Guys are coming back from injury, all those things. It's nobody's fault, but that's what it's been,\" Eberflus said. \"It's been some inconsistencies there with having guys available, and you have to move your scheme based on what you have. That's important for any coach to be able to do that. Certainly we have to do a better job in the passing game. That's the reason for it.\"</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Cowboys defense by coordinator since 2021 (NFL ranks)</th><th>Dan Quinn (2021-2023)</th><th>Mike Zimmer (2024)</th><th>Matt Eberflus (Present)*</th></tr><tr><td><p>Man coverage rate</p></td><td><p>33.8% (3rd)</p></td><td><p>26% (15th)</p></td><td><p>6.2% (Last)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zone coverage rate</p></td><td><p>63% (28th)</p></td><td><p>70.2% (15th)</p></td><td><p>87.5% (1st)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Blitz rate</p></td><td><p>30.2% (10th)</p></td><td><p>32.7% (10th)</p></td><td><p>21.7% (26th)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>QB pressure rate</p></td><td><p>41.4% (1st)</p></td><td><p>36.2% (9th)</p></td><td><p>33.3% (T-21st)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>* Weeks 1-4, 2025 season</em></p><p>Fortunately for Dallas' defense, their Week 5 matchup at the winless New York Jets will mostly center around the battle at the line of scrimmage against a Jets offense powered by the rushing yards generated by scrambling quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a> and running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a>. New ranks third in the league in rushing yards per game (144.5) but fourth worst in the NFL in passing yards per game (160.3). Just like when the Cowboys faced the then-winless Bears in Chicago in Week 3, Dallas will be prepared for trick plays. Chicago quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/\">Caleb Williams</a> burned the Cowboys' defense with a 65-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Luther Burden on a flea flicker. </p><p>\"I feel like they'll come out with trick plays, and try to give us their best shot early. Take shots. When the ball is in the air, we have to capitalize,\" Diggs said. \"Regardless of whatever call is called, whatever we need to do. Ball in the air, we have to capitalize. ... It's going to work out. We got all the talent. Same guys I've been with since I've been here. We just have to be ready and get the ball.\"z</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span><strong> —</strong> Defense was supposed to be the fix. That was what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> chased all season. Last year, the team was buried -- second-to-last in the majors with 115 errors. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> had more, at 117. So <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184351/alex-bregman/\">Alex Bregman</a> was acquired, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165929/rafael-devers/\">Rafael Devers</a> was slid to DH, then eventually traded. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/\">Trevor Story</a> stayed healthy, which allowed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931004/ceddanne-rafaela/\">Ceddanne Rafaela</a> to be moved back to center, where a Gold Glove will likely be won.</p><p>By the numbers, Boston's outfield was rated the best in baseball, racking up 52 defensive runs saved. But defensive metrics can be tricky because the full story isn't told. They can be flawed. And if the Red Sox are watched long enough, their defensive flaws are seen, too.</p><p>So in Game 3 of the Wild Card, under the lights in the Bronx, mistakes piled up again. In a blink, the season was gone, sealed by a 4-0 loss. The rival Yankees scored all four runs in the fourth inning. </p><p>Red Sox rookie starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658250/connelly-early/\">Connelly Early</a> entered the top of the fourth inning with just 45 pitches, going toe-to-toe with fellow rookie Cam Schlittler, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/cam-schlittler-rewards-yankees-faith-with-unforgettable-12-strikeout-outing-that-ends-red-soxs-season/\" target=\"_blank\">who would eventually turn in eight scoreless frames and 12 strikeouts</a></span>. The most by a Yankee rookie in postseason history.</p>\n<p>\"We needed to be perfect tonight because he was perfect,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said after the game.</p><p>In a 0-0 game, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> worked the count to 3-2. On the sixth pitch of the at-bat, a fly ball was lofted to right-center field. It dropped in for a double, beginning a nose dive from which the Red Sox could not recover.</p>\n<p>\"I think Wilyer broke back, right, with a swing,\" added Cora. \"Just somebody, right? They have to make that play. With the swing, he didn't get a good jump and it just landed there. That's a play we make.\"</p>\n<p>Yet it was a play that Abreu sometimes struggled with.</p><p>The ball landed in short right-center, bouncing off the glove of the diving Rafaela. Abreu, indeed, broke back -- not for the first time. More on that later. A direct angle was had to the ball but he pulled up once Rafaela was seen.</p><p>\"That was a tough play,\" Abreu said. \"It was in between us. We were playing very far away so we couldn't get there.\"</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>Abreu, who won a Gold Glove last year, has often been guilty of over-committing. And it is done too soon. His internal clock has lacked feel and timing. While many balls are reached diagonally, going back or charging in has been a struggle. On this play, instead of patience and a proper read, a commitment backward was made immediately. The safe move, of course, is always to take a step back. Getting burned on a ball in is far worse -- a double over your head more times than not. But this has happened to Abreu way too often. Just look at the play last week against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a>, the final series of the season.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931997/parker-meadows/\">Parker Meadows</a> hit a weak fly ball off the end of the bat. A ball that should have been caught. But again, Abreu's aggressive commitment back allowed it to drop in for a single.</p><p>Then there is the Rafaela element. Typically, great reads and jumps are made, relying more on feel than calculation. The outfield is played like a cornerback in football -- freakish athletic ability with a knack for covering ground quickly.</p><p>But a banana route was taken this time. Almost in a semi-circle before the line was corrected. Neither of them called the ball.</p>\n<p>\"I just gave my all to catch that ball,\" Rafaela said. \"I saw that Willie didn't maybe have a chance, so I gave it my all to catch that ball.\"</p><p>Communication issues in the outfield plagued the Red Sox all season. And, in part, Rafaela was expected to catch everything.</p><p>Go back to the late August matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a>. A ball in left field should have been caught by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932710/jarren-duran/\">Jarren Duran</a>, but Rafaela was expected to take it, so it dropped between them.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox finished just outside the top 10 in DRS. The left side of the infield was shored up. Center field improved. And still, the majors were led in errors with 116 -- one more than last year. The final run-scoring play of the Red Sox season came on an error as first baseman Nathaniel Lowe botched a grounder off the bat of Ben Rice.</p><p>Those lapses are the reason the packing up is being done early, the team headed home as October begins.</p><p>\"Obviously, we should feel the way we feel right now, because we had bigger goals,\" Cora said. \"But when we have time to reflect on how we did things this year, this is what the Boston Red Sox are, it's a good group.\"</p>\n<p>Just not good enough in Game 3.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><em>Once again CBS Sports presents our annual Candid Coaches series, which spotlights relevant topics and issues in men's college basketball. Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander polled roughly 100 coaches in recent weeks on a variety of subjects. Coaches spoke on background and were provided anonymity to offer unfiltered opinions. This is the second installment in our 2025 survey.</em></p><hr /><p>The House Settlement that took effect this summer generated a lot of money for attorneys and also returned something akin to recruiting regulations to college athletics. In theory, each Division I athletic department now has up to $20.5 million to spend on athletes however it sees fit. In theory, name, image and likeness deals that were more or less unlimited in recent years are now supposed to be scrutinized with anything that looks more like pay-for-play than actual NIL disallowed.</p><p>In other words, there are rules again.</p><p>The days of coaches getting a group of boosters to stack money so that they can deliver it to a prospect in exchange for nothing more than his commitment are supposed to be over. But are they? With that in mind, Matt Norlander and I decided to ask more than 100 college coaches the following question:</p><h2>Assuming there now is what amounts to a salary cap in college athletics, do you trust that your competitors will recruit within the rules?</h2><p><strong>No:</strong> 89%<br /><strong>Yes:</strong> 11%</p><h2>Quotes that stood out</h2><p>From coaches who answered \"No.\"</p><ul><li>\"I do not trust that most high-level competitors will stay within the rules. There is too much at stake. Personally, I would rather it be that way. It allowed opposing coaches to know who they were recruiting against and make the decision to stay involved or not.\"</li><li>\"No. That has never happened.\"</li></ul><ul><li>\"Absolutely not. I don't think there's one coach who's going to say we're going to follow the pillars of the NCAA constitution, get the f-ck out of here.\"</li><li>\"No, everybody will attempt to be as creative as they can to skirt the rules and gain a competitive advantage. There will also be a lack of oversight & governance.\"</li><li>\"No, at least not 100%. Until we have a governing body that can enforce rules and levy out 'real' punishments, those who have always found a way or 'cheated' will continue to do so.\" </li><li>\"We are in the SOUTH region of the United States. There are no rules, only getting wins. Let's be real.\"</li><li>\"I do not trust our competitors to recruit within the rules at all. (We are in the SEC, remember). And a fair salary cap at our level should be around $8 to $10 million per roster.\"</li><li>\"No. The precedent has been set over the last couple of years with how recruiting has been done. Now they have even more of a direct line to donors/money-people.\" </li><li>\"No. If you get more than two people to say yes, you should cancel all their other answers. It's too competitive. We live in a competitive environment. Coaches are going to do what they need to get players.\"</li><li>\"Hell no. Ask [Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve] Ballmer!\"</li></ul><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-school-made-the-best-college-basketball-coaching-hire-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Candid Coaches: Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Candid Coaches: Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/628b336b-f010-49c6-90a5-69bd162b4c9e/thumbnail/270x152/a1f8a422a4a637f9254c41fdca1612ee/cc-oct1-v2-1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>From coaches who answered \"Yes.\"</h2><ul><li>\"I think you have to [follow the rules now]. In my opinion, this isn't five to 10 years ago -- when programs had to figure out how to hide a $10,000-to-$50,000 payment. You are [now] talking about hiding <em>hundreds of thousands of dollars</em>, and in some cases <em>millions</em>. Maybe I am naive, I just don't see how people will hide that amount of money.\"</li><li>\"I believe that at the low/mid-major level there will be adherence to the rules because of lack of funds/opportunity to go beyond.\"</li><li>\"Do I think 51% of the guys will follow these rules? Yes. Do I think 80%? That's pushing my optimism.\"</li></ul><h2>The takeaway<br /></h2><p>The answers here illustrate something I've been writing and talking about since before the House Settlement even became a reality -- that a salary cap in college basketball, particularly a salary cap in college basketball that will differ for different programs even in the same conferences, was never going to work as currently constructed. Think about it: When the salary cap was effectively zero for decades and decades and decades, cheating was rampant in recruiting with ambitious coaches trying to create advantages and beat-down coaches just fighting to keep up.</p><p>So why would any of that change now?</p><p>Hard caps are still hard caps.</p><p>And the same types of coaches who used to bust right through them before will simply bust right through them again, by any means necessary, after making the assessment that the possible reward -- i.e., wins, championships and millions of dollars in contract extensions -- outweighs any perceived risk.</p>\n<p>It's an accurate assessment.</p><p>Think about all of the coaches who have gotten into trouble for so-called cheating over the past decade. I don't have to name them. You know who they are. Now think about how many of them still have the jobs they had or have recovered nicely with similar or even better jobs. In this sport, cheating has never ended careers as much as losing does. So every set of rules ever created has been broken over and over again by countless individuals for as long as rules have existed. And I always figured the return of what amounts to recruiting rules, after a brief period of anything-goes, would lead to the return of strong-ass offers and under-the-table payments.</p><p>As you can see, coaches agree.</p><p>Nearly nine out of every 10 coaches we asked told us they do not trust their competitors to recruit within the rules -- and, it should be noted, only one high-major coach polled disagreed. One high-major coach actually told me he doesn't believe his competitors will follow the new rules because he already knows <em>he's</em> not going to follow the new rules.</p><p>\"You know what conference I work in,\" the coach said. \"How much do you think we're winning if I'm following these new rules? And here's the other thing: At least before, we all knew the rules, and then we could decide whether or not to break them. But now the rules are confusing. People either don't understand them or don't believe in them. And none of us believe anybody is really following them.

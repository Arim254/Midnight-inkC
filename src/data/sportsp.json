They were able to rebound for a 63-14 win over FCS opponent South Carolina State and then enjoyed a bye week, but Charlotte also had an extra week of prep. The 49ers have struggled a bit in Tim Albin's first season, but this is a big number and the model has <strong>Charlotte covering in 62% of simulations.</strong></p><p>BYU -20.5 vs. West Virginia (-110)</p><p>\"West Virginia gets a late-night kickoff a long way from home. QB Nicco Marchiol is out, rehabbing from injury, and might be joined by other starters. Not a promising scenario for the Mountaineers, who've been outscored by 65 points in a pair of Big 12 games and did not penetrate the goal line during the first half in either,\" SportsLine college football expert Mike Tierney (9-3 on his last 12 CFB picks) said. \"They cannot count on turnovers from BYU QB Bear Bachmeier, who has yet to unfurl an interception.

However, the schedule has been pretty tough thus far and the Rams actually played Washington State a little tougher than San Diego State did, losing 20-3 while SDSU lost 36-13.

Nonetheless, Western Kentucky quarterback Maverick McIvor has thrown for 1,474 passing yards with 11 touchdowns. This season, the Hilltoppers are 4-1 ATS in all games, and Delaware is 0-1 ATS as the home favorite. SportsLine's model has the Hilltoppers going on the road and covering the spread in 69% of simulations. </p><h2>West Virginia (+20.5) vs. BYU (-114)</h2><p>The Mountaineers are 2-0 against BYU all-time, but head into this game as massive underdogs. The Cougars have allowed more points defensively each week, which could lead to West Virginia keeping this one closer than people expect. BYU allowed 172 rushing yards last week against Colorado, and that could be an area that West Virginia attacks to keep the Cougars' offense off the field. The SportsLine Projection Model is projecting the Mountaineers to cover the spread in 64% of simulations. </p><h2>New Mexico vs. San Jose State: Over 58.5 total points</h2><p>New Mexico enters this contest averaging 30.5 points and 391 total yards of offense per game.

The Spartans have picked up offensively, tallying at least 28 points in back-to-back games. Receiver Danny Scudero has 33 catches for 514 receiving yards and three touchdowns for the Spartans.

Western Kentucky ranks 16th in the country in passing yards (302 yards per game) while throwing on 58.02% of plays, the 14th-highest pass-play percentage in the nation. Senior quarterback Maverick McIvor threw for 317 yards in a 27-22 win over Missouri State last week. Delaware is allowing 29.3 points per game, which ranks 90th in college football. Western Kentucky has three receivers with more than 230 yards and three running backs with more than 150 rushing yards, making the Hilltoppers a challenging team to gameplan against. The model projects Western Kentucky to win in 66% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds in a 7 p.m. start on CBS Sports Network.</p><h2>West Virginia (+20.5) vs. BYU (-115)</h2><p>The Mountaineers are coming off back-to-back lopsided losses, but the model doesn't expect that trend to continue against BYU. West Virginia is one of the most run-heavy teams in college football, rushing on 60.55% of plays. That is the 17th-most in college football, which is similar to how the offense was run during Rich Rodriguez's first tenure as head coach at the university. The Mountaineers' rushing attack is starting to come together with a roster filled with transfer portal players learning Rodriguez's system for the first time, as West Virginia rushed for 261 yards last week, raising its average to 172.3 rushing yards per game. If West Virginia can control the time of possession, it can keep this game within a few scores to cover the margin.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> had a chance to sneak a road win on Friday, but ultimately fell, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/gametracker/boxscore/WNBA_20251003_PHO@LVA/\" target=\"_blank\">89-86</a>, to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is set for Sunday at 3 p.m. ET.</p><p>The Mercury have been in this position before, as they lost the first game in both the first round and semifinals. This, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677851/kahleah-copper/\">Kahleah Copper</a> said postgame, has taught Phoenix how to bounce back stronger.</p><p>\"Obviously that it doesn't matter. Not that it doesn't matter, but it's OK,\" she said when asked about what her team has learned. \"This is a long series. I think the takeaway from those other first ones, the mindset was 'back to the drawing board.' We had the utmost confidence in our locker room and in our coaches to make the adjustments. Now it's the same thing.\"</p>\n<p>Phoenix was locked in on both sides of the ball for most the night. The Mercury defense gave the Aces plenty of issues, and they reached uncharted territory on offense with 14 3-pointers – the most in any Game 1 in WNBA Finals history. It would have been logical to predict a Phoenix victory based on how hot they were from beyond the arc, but the Aces stole the momentum late in the game.</p>\n<p>Copper gave Phoenix five 3-pointers in the first two quarters, which tied <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105071/diana-taurasi/\">Diana Taurasi</a> for most 3s in a WNBA Finals half. She finished the night with a team-high 21 points, but most of that productivity happened in the first half, being held to just three points in the second. Part of it was the Aces going from man-to-man defense in the first half to zone in the second.</p><p>The Aces took a 78-77 lead as the clock read 6:46 in the fourth quarter after a 3-pointer by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677836/dana-evans/\">Dana Evans</a>, who gave her team 21 points off the bench. However, the game remained close and wasn't really decided until the last minute.</p><p>A driving layup by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> cut Phoenix's deficit to 87-86 with 52 seconds remaining. She then made a strong defensive play against Aces star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/\">A'ja Wilson</a> with under 30 seconds left and got herself to the free throw line. Unfortunately for her team, she missed both attempts. </p>\n<p>On the next possession, Copper fouled Aces guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678025/jackie-young/\">Jackie Young</a>, who made both free throws. The Mercury called a full timeout and Mercury head coach Nate Tibbetts said they planned to give Copper a chance to send the game to overtime, but Las Vegas' defense spoiled that plan. Instead, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> was forced into a desperation shot from behind the arc, which wasn't close.</p><p>\"We have to play better defense,\" Sabally said postgame. \"Just go back to what we do best and I think the results will show that we are the better team. But I'm really not too down on myself. This game is [over]. We'll go back, we'll practice tomorrow. We'll walk through our mistakes and find better solutions for some things. We'll just come back on Sunday and win the game.\" </p><p>Sabally ended the night with 19 points, while Thomas flirted with a triple-double as she picked up 15 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. Although falling behind 0-1 isn't ideal, the Mercury are still feeling confident in their chances.</p>\n<p>\"You always want to get one early and we put ourselves in a position [to win],\" Tibbetts said. \"These are two of the best teams. That's why we are the last two standing. We talked about it earlier. We've made some of these plays down the stretch. We didn't make them tonight. But we'll be ready on Sunday.\"</p>\n            </div>",

Jones, 39, was the oldest of three brother who came from a family of elite athletes, including legendary UFC champion Jon Jones. In fact, Arthur nearly followed his younger brother into mixed martial arts.</p><p>Arthur contemplated fighting MMA during the 2011 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL</a> Lockout. In March 2011, the NFL and the players' union failed to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement. Owners imposed a lockout, shutting down team facilities and workouts and stopped paying players' contracts. With Arthur unable to train or workout with his Baltimore Ravens teammates during the lockout, which lasted until July 25, he seriously considered taking an MMA fight.</p><p>\"I love MMA,\" Arthur told the <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Indianapolis Star</a> in 2014. \"It's fun to watch, and  it's something I entertained early in my football career, if football  didn't work out, of me fighting in the UFC. But things are going well  for me right now, so I'm going to stick with my career.</p><p>\"I  was supposed to take a fight when we had the lockout a few years ago. I  was getting ready to schedule it, and I was training for it. Thank God  for the other guy, the lockout ended.\"</p>\n<p>Arthur has some martial arts experience. He was a two-time New York state wrestling heavyweight champion, and trained in other disciplines with Jon at Jackson-Winkeljohn MMA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, during the offseason.</p><p>\"I was a really good wrestler, so that was my  base, but I do a lot of boxing in a my off-season training,\" Arthur  said. \"I train at Greg Jackson's pretty much every offseason.</p><p>\"I  love it. It keeps my mind fresh. It just keeps me hungry when it's  football season because I'm training parts and muscles and different  things, and it keeps me active in different ways so I don't get bored  doing the same thing with football.\"</p>\n<p>Jon, considered by many to be the greatest MMA fighter of all time and indisputably the best light heavyweight champion in UFC history, credited his fighting mentality to growing up as Arthur's younger brother.</p><p>\"Not only was Arthur older and bigger, but he was a freak athlete,\"  Jon told <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2721249-jon-jones-ufc-214-interview-drugs-cormier-family?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bleacher Report</a> in 2017. \"So, yeah, I pretty much grew up getting my ass kicked by a  really special talent. I think it's why I turned out to be so tough.</p><p>\"Sometimes we'd just slap each other, and a fight would break out. That's  what brothers do. That's what makes us all great competitors: We never  back down from anything.\" </p>\n<p>Arthur and Jon were both high school wrestling standouts, but Arthur acknowledged that his younger brother was the more talented wrestler.</p><p>\"I must confess here: I had the much easier route wrestling at 275,\"  Arthur said. \"Jon had all the studs in his weight class, wrestling 195.  Those are men sizes -- the average man as a senior or junior in high  school. His competition was a lot stiffer than mine. I had better  competition once I got to the state level, but Jon always had tough  competition. But he was a guy who never quit.\" </p><p>Emergency Medical Services responded to Jones' home in Syracuse, New York, shortly before 11 a.m. on Friday, <a href=\"https://x.com/SteveInfantiNC9/status/1974286159812468991\" target=\"_blank\">according to</a> News Channel 9's Steve Infanti. An Onondaga County Sheriff's  spokesperson told the outlet that Jones' pacemaker went off in the  morning, automatically alerting his doctor. Jones had a pre-existing  heart condition.  </p>\n<p>Jon and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1971327/chandler-jones/\" target=\"_blank\">Chandler Jones</a>, the youngest of the three Jones brothers, have not publicly addressed his passing. </p>\n            </div>",

After a 26-10 blowout loss in Jacksonville, the Panthers rallied from a large deficit in the fourth quarter to fall in Arizona, 27-22 in Week 2. Then they followed that up with a crushing 30-0 home win against Atlanta, who was coming off an upset win in Minnesota the week before.

Ankalaev has fired back on social media, and around and around the fighters have gone.</p>\n<p>Speaking to CBS Sports via an interpreter, Ankalaev placed the blame squarely on Pereira and his camp for the bad blood entering Saturday's clash, saying, \"The whole aggression was started by the other side, Alex started it.\"</p><p>What Ankalaev was more interested in addressing was Pereira's recent claims to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/alex-pereira-reveals-he-was-at-just-40-in-title-loss-to-magomed-anakalev-surprised-i-was-able-to-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports' Brian Campbell</a></span> that the Brazilian entered the first fight at just \"40%\" of what he's capable of being due to various issues, resulting in a less dangerous version of his trademark striking.</p>\n<p>\"If he's going to talk about being 40% there or 40% ready, I can say I was only 20%,\" Ankalaev said. \"Everybody knows when the last fight was. It was the holy month of Ramadan, so I wasn't able to prepare the way I needed to prepare either. So, I don't think he should even mention the 40% because everybody knows that I had a much harder camp than he did and a harder time preparing.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-alex-pereira-gets-his-chance-at-redemption-after-rare-humbling-loss-against-magomed-ankalaev/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/708592ee-b8e1-443c-ae13-300a57f2abc9/thumbnail/270x152/54e07dd73f63a36081fb6cd613ed5c3c/pereira-yell-ufc-313.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>During Ramadan, Muslims fast from food and drink from dawn to sunset for a month. Those fasting rules present unique challenges for high-level athletes who follow regimented schedules the rest of the year for exercise and the required food and drink intake to achieve maximum fitness and performance.</p><p>The first fight with Pereira came slightly over a week into Ramadan, which Ankalaev believes impacted his performance, even as he won a unanimous decision by scores of 49-46, 48-47 and 48-47.</p>\n<p>Being able to train and compete without the restrictions of Ramadan this time around, Ankalaev believes he'll be a sharper, better version of himself.</p><p>\"I think I can surprise him with my striking this time around, now that I've had more time to prepare and a full camp,\" Ankalaev said. \"I can also surprise him and give him trouble with my wrestling. This time around, I had a good preparation and a good time getting ready for this fight. You're going to see this is a whole different fight from the first one.\"</p>\n<p>Compared to expectations ahead of their UFC 313 clash, Pereira vs. Ankalaev looked like something out of Bizarro World.</p>\n<p>Ankalaev outstruck the multi-time kickboxing champion, landing 30 more total strikes, while Pereira stuffed all 12 of the superior grappler's takedown attempts. While Ankalaev's takedowns weren't working, his grappling did allow him to smother Pereira in the clinch and dictate the range at which the fight was contested.</p><p>Asked why he was unable to be more successful with his takedowns in the March bout, Ankalaev again pointed to his camp and preparation as the key factor in the fight while saying he will be able to take Pereira down any time he wishes in the rematch.</p><p>\"The only thing that's needed in this fight to take him down is my desire to do so,\" Ankalaev said. \"I just need to want to take him down, and that's what I'll do. In the first fight, I wasn't as well prepared as I wanted to be because of the timing and the camp. Now, you'll see it's all up to me. The only thing I need to do to take him down is just wish for it and do it whenever I feel like it. I will be fully in control of the fight; you will see it.\"</p>\n<p>Ankalaev is riding a 13-fight unbeaten streak, winning 12 and battling Jan Błachowicz to a dull draw in a 2022 bout for the then-vacant light heavyweight championship. It was a long path for Ankalaev, who believed champions didn't want to give him opportunities to fight for the belt as he piled up victories for more than half a decade.</p><p>Knowing how hard it was to get to the mountaintop, Ankalaev said that his approach to being champion is to say yes to whoever the UFC puts in front of him, even if it means granting Pereira an immediate rematch.</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't a plan that we had to immediately rematch him,\" Ankalaev said. \"I didn't think about rematching right away. This is something I told the UFC even before I was champion, 'When I become a champion, I'm not going to pick my opponents, I don't need you to pick opponents for me. I will fight whoever is deserving.'</p>\n<p>\"When I was a contender, when I wasn't champion yet, there were champions who did not want to give me a fight and trying to avoid me. It was like, no matter how many times I tried, the UFC wasn't giving me a chance to fight for the belt. So, I said to myself and the UFC that when I'm champion, whoever is the next in line and most deserving, that's who I want to fight.\"</p><p>Some fighters are making their case to be the next fighter up for the winner of Saturday night's main event.</p><p>This past Saturday, Carlos Ulberg <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-fight-night-results-highlights-carlos-ulberg-blasts-dominick-reyes-for-first-round-ko-wants-title-shot/\" target=\"_blank\">scored a first-round knockout</a></span> of Dominick Reyes in a UFC Fight Night main event. And on the UFC 320 main card, former light heavyweight champ Jiri Prochazka will battle former title challenger Khalil Rountree.</p>\n<p>Ulberg is ranked No. 3 in the UFC's official light heavyweight rankings while Prochazka is No. 2, and Rountree sits at No. 4. It seems clear that the winner of Ankalaev vs. Pereira will have some clear deserving challenges come Sunday morning. Ankalaev seems more interested in Ulberg as someone who had not lost to Pereira during the Brazilian's reign as champion, as is the case with Prochazka and Rountree.</p><p>\"Obviously, I'm looking at the division and the new guys,\" Ankalaev said. \"There are some guys who already have losses to the former champion, so I'm very interested in seeing the new guys and whoever is next and deserving. The UFC, whoever they want to give me, it seems as though some guys are going well and haven't lost in a while, I think Ulberg hasn't lost in a good amount of time, but we'll see.</p><p>\"In the past, if the UFC needed them to stall or get a loss, usually they would put a contender against me. Whenever somebody needed to be stopped, they would give them a fight against me, and all of a sudden, those guys get stopped.\"</p>\n<p>Before looking ahead to the next challenger, however, Ankalaev knows Saturday will be a dangerous fight against an opponent who will be looking to go for broke in an attempt to regain the belt.</p><p>\"I think it's going to be a firefight because he's going to be going for broke; he's got nothing to lose,\" Ankalaev said. \"He's going to try and do whatever he can to win and I'm going to do whatever I can to stop him early. I think it's going to be an exciting fight, a ruthless fight, and it's going to be very, very different from the fight we saw before. It's going to be something everyone is going to want to tune in for.\"</p><p><strong>Who wins UFC 320: Ankalaev vs. Pereira, and how exactly does the fight end? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-320-odds-picks-mma-analyst-releases-picks-for-ankalaev-vs-pereira-2-and-other-fights-for-october-4-showcase/#ttag=100425_agg_cbssports_picks_UFC_DanielVithlani_UFC320AnkalaevPereira2\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert</a> who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

He still has a lot of traits shared by top hitters, though, and was on about a 20-homer, 20-steal pace from June 1 on, so you could do worse than to fall back on him here.  <br /></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div>\n    <div>\n                        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153549/matt-shaw/fantasy/\">\n                        <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/02/18/be162880-6456-417f-9f41-818068f39836/thumbnail/100x100/48e639d0c47b6a76d35771c1f9378197/29153549.png\" /></figure>\n                                            </div>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p><span>\n                    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153549/matt-shaw/fantasy/\">\n                Matt Shaw\n                    </a>\n            </span>\n            <span>\n            Chicago Cubs 3B\n        </span>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n</td></tr><tr><td>Even with some improvement in the second half, Shaw's rookie season was a dud overall, his bottom-of-the-barrel exit velocity readings giving reason to wonder if he arrived fully baked.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Throughout the years, I've been often surprised by how many handicappers attack the weekly slate of games looking for all sorts of angles and trends, many of them statistically-based, as they seek clues for the upcoming card. That's fine, but it should probably be accompanied by a simple measurable that can prove most beneficial to handicapping the upcoming slate of games, yet often overlooked. </p><p>I have long believed that before tackling the weekly slate, a quick review of how teams are performing vs. the spread, specifically an easy-to-use list of current spread streaks, win and lose, should be the first step in scoping the weekly card. </p><p>Why? Identifying just a handful of streaking point spread teams, win or loss, early in their ascents or descents, can often make the difference between a winning and losing season for the handicapper. There's nothing better than pegging a streak and riding that trend for as long as it lasts.</p><p>Invariably, there are several of those spread streaks each season -- the key as always is to identify them early enough to take advantage.  Every five-or-six-game spread streak was once a one or two-game, streak. This is why we like to identify all teams on as brief as a two-game win streak vs. the spread, as the next teams to reach three, four, five, six, seven or more spread covers in a row are always embedded in that grouping. </p><p>Into October, we have a good enough sampling of games to begin charting these streaks on a weekly basis.  Here are the current point spread streaks heading into this weekend's action. </p><h3>Point spread win streaks</h3><p><strong>5:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\"

and distorted final scores, we can effectively introduce Away From Spread (\"AFS\") calculations to this weekly offering.  As noted earlier, what AFS analysis strives to accomplish is identifying potential soft spots, both for good and bad, for teams that are either being underrated, or overrated, by the oddsmakers.  By measuring results away from the point spread, we can get a better feel of how accurately the oddsmakers, and by extension the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">college football betting</a></span> marketplace, are rating these teams. </p><p>This calculation is a further refinement and goes beyond the basic spread win/loss records (and accompanying streaks), which remain  are the most important measurable every week. Yet a team that wins back-to-back games by, say, 21 points as a 7-point favorite in each contest can be said to be overachieving vs. expectation; by landing +14 points from the spread each week over both games in a two-week span, said team is +28 points ATS across that span, or +14 per week.  Conversely, a 7-point underdog on consecutive weeks that loses each game by 21 points would be -28 ATS across that span, or -14 per week -- significantly underachieving against the spread. </p><p>As with any such calculation, finding appropriate parameters is important.  We have found over the years that a two-week running average is often the best indicator of what might happen in the next game; a three-week average, though potentially more revealing, also stretches back a bit further and values results equally from two games before.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season is relatively short, and history has shown us that the sooner to potentially identify these trailing AFS numbers, the better, and the two-game average is a more immediate reflection of form than a three-game average. </p><p>Of course, the two-game average is open to more distortions by a particularly lopsided score, so what we have done in this calculation is note teams (accompanied by an asterisk) that have had at least one of their past two results land 21 points or more away from the spread.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana's</a> recent 63-10 thrashing of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> is one such example. That was a result so lopsided it will obviously mandate that each side is in any such two-week calculation, so we simply note that distorted score line in the listings. It's worth noting that both the Hoosiers and Fighting Illini reversed the spread results in their games following the 63-10 blowout (Indiana faied to cover vs. Iowa, Illinois won and covered vs. USC). Thus, teams can appear on the \"+\" side of the two-week running average that might have lost a point spread decision within that span, just as a team on the \"-\" side might have a spread win. Though, as always, view these and other measurables with a degree of discretion. </p><p>The new AFS calculation still includes a handful of mismatch results vs. FCS foes, games that are about to disappear from the upcoming schedules.  As we didn't want to wait any longer to begin noting the weekly AFS numbers, some FBS teams are still going to have recorded AFS results vs. FCS-level teams.  Moving forward, the results vs. FCS teams will almost universally drop off from any two-week AFS calculation. </p><p>Thus, following are updated AFS lists, both on the plus (+) and minus (-) sides, using a running two-game average of at least 7 or more points from the spread for inclusion.  As noted above, a team with at least one distorting result of 21 or more points away from the spread, win or lose,  is accompanied by an asterisk.</p><h3>AFS + </h3><ul><li>San Diego State +24.50*</li><li>Indiana +21.00* </li><li>New Mexico +21.00*</li><li> Western Michigan +20.25*</li><li> Duke +19.50*</li><li>Notre Dame +19.50*</li><li>Delaware +19.00*</li><li> Ole Miss +17.50*</li><li> Texas tech +17.25*</li><li>Michigan +17.00*</li><li>Cincinnati +15.00</li><li>Miami-Fla +15.00</li><li>Virginia +13.25</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a> +13.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ODU/old-dominion-monarchs/\">Old Dominion</a> +12.50*</li><li> Memphis +11.50</li><li>Louisiana Tech +11.00</li><li> ULM +11.00</li><li>James Madison +10.50</li><li>Utah State +10.50</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> +9.00</li><li>Central Michigan +8,75</li><li> South Carolina +8.75</li><li>Ball State +8.50</li><li>Boise State +8.50</li><li>Hawaii +8.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MOST/missouri-state-bears/\">Missouri State</a> +8.00</li><li>Rice +7.75</li><li>Miami-Ohio +7.00</li></ul><h3>AFS - </h3><ul><li>Arkansas -23.00*</li><li>West Virginia -19.50</li><li> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CAL/california-golden-bears/\">California</a> -19.00*</li><li>Illinois -19.00*</li><li>Clemson -18.50*</li><li>Georgia State -18.50</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> -18.00*</li><li> Appalachian State -17.75</li><li> Boston College -17.00</li><li>South Alabama -16.75*</li><li>New Mexico State -13.25</li><li> UTEP -13.25</li><li> Sam Houston -12.75</li><li> Arkansas State -11.00</li><li>Army -12.00</li><li>Florida Atlantic -11.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a> -11.00*</li><li>North Carolina State -10.25</li><li>Georgia Tech -9.50</li><li>Kentucky -9.00</li><li>Nevada -9.00</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLOST/colorado-state-rams/\">Colorado State</a> -8.75*</li><li>Air Force -8.50</li><li>Florida -8.00</li><li>Minnesota -8.00</li><li>SMU -8.00</li></ul>\n            </div>",

West Virginia (2-3, 0-2) has dropped back-to-back Big 12 contests and is coming off a Week 5 defeat to Utah, 48-14.

West Virginia ranks third in the Big 12 in rushing offense, with 11 touchdowns on the ground through five games. It is coming off a 261-yard ground effort versus a Utah defense which has the No. 20 scoring defense in the nation, and WVU had over 170 rushing yards in each of its previous two games.</p><p>BYU failed to cover last week in its Big 12 opener, and that's been a theme for the Cougars when matched up against conference foes. BYU is 0-5 against the spread in its last five conference games, and while WVU is coming off an outright defeat to Utah, the team has shown a resiliency following losses. West Virginia is 7-4-1 ATS following a straight-up defeat since the start of the 2024 season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/byu-vs-west-virginia-odds-line-2025-college-football-picks-for-week-6-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_BYUWestVirginiacfb\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why BYU can cover</h2><p>The Cougars are ranked for the second straight week, and that's a bad sign for WVU, considering its recent failures versus ranked squads. The Mountaineers have lost eight straight games versus top-25 opponents, going winless against the spread (0-7-1) over this stretch. This year's WVU team ranks second-worst in the Big 12 with 22 points per game, making it a monumental task as it faces a Cougars defense which is fourth-best in all of FBS. BYU is allowing just 9.2 points and has allowed only one passing touchdown all year.</p><p>On offense, Brigham Young is putting up over 250 rushing yards per game at a sterling 6.3 rushing average. The Cougars also cherish the ball, having committed just one turnover, while they have seven takeaways on the season. Their turnover margin per game is among the five best in all of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>, while WVU has a negative turnover margin (-2), making it an uphill battle for the Mountaineers to stay within this spread. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/byu-vs-west-virginia-odds-line-2025-college-football-picks-for-week-6-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_BYUWestVirginiacfb\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>How to make BYU vs. West Virginia picks</h2><p>SportsLine's model has simulated West Virginia vs. BYU 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 54 combined points.

On the shoulders of back-to-back 66s at Carnoustie Golf Links and Kingsbarns Golf Links, Robert MacIntyre will take a share of the lead at the 2025 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship into the weekend at 12 under alongside Richard Sterne.</p><p>MacIntyre will contest his third round at the Old Course at St. Andrews before a cut is made following 54 holes. The final round of the competition will see the remainder of the field take to the Old Course once again.</p><p>\"It was almost a perfect round of golf, especially once the weather came in, just lovely round,\" MacIntyre said.</p><p>Whipping winds and pestering rains posed many problems for players in the second round -- and caused a stoppage in play in the afternoon -- but did little to slow the momentum of MacIntyre. A quick start to his front nine saw him add three circles to his scorecard in the first four holes before a healthy diet of pars emerged to close out his first nine (the second nine at Kingsbarns).</p>\n<p>Weather persisted, as did MacIntyre, on the outward half of the property. Exchanging a birdie and a bogey across the first two holes on the golf course, the sturdy left hander kept the hammer down and rattled off three more birdies on his back nine to match his opening 33 with another. His last of the day on the par-5 9th was enough to give MacIntyre a share of the lead, one stroke clear of Louis Oosthuizen.</p><p>\"Just golfed the ball really well,\" MacIntyre said. \"Thought I controlled my flights really well. It's difficult when it gets this windy. It hard to hit the ball good with the wind. So I was having to try and fight the wind on certain holes and wasn't comfortable. But I made some beautiful shots. Yeah, putted solidly in the wind.\"</p>\n<p>MacIntyre is not the only player from the blue and gold to overcome the quick turnaround from Bethpage Black. Englishman and former tournament winner Matt Fitzpatrick continues his string of consistency and sits only four behind his teammate following rounds of 67 and 69 on Carnoustie and Kingsbarns.</p>\n<p>Tyrrell Hatton and Tommy Fleetwood are also in with a chance heading into the second half of this tournament one worse than Fitzpatrick at 7 under. Meanwhile, two-time major champion Dustin Johnson dazzled with an opening 64 at Carnoustie but backed it up with a 77 on Friday at Kingsbarns to send his name tumbling down the leaderboard no thanks to playing his final six holes in a 6-over fashion including a triple bogey-8 on his finisher.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

The move comes days after the team and former manager Bruce Bochy, who in 2023 led Texas to its first World Series title in franchise history, mutually agreed to part ways.</p><blockquote><p>\"We are thrilled to announce this promotion and have Skip leading this club in the dugout,\" said Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young in a statement released by the team. \"Over his past year as a senior advisor to our baseball operations group, Skip has proven to be driven, passionate and thorough in everything he does. He has a winning spirit and energy, and we are fortunate that someone so highly regarded in the industry has agreed to become our manager.</p><p>\"We have enjoyed getting to know Skip and his family since he joined the organization last year, and we look forward to welcoming his wife Lindsey and the entire Schumaker family to the Metroplex.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schumaker, 45, becomes the 21st manager in franchise history. He previously managed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Miami Marlins</a> for two seasons, including a 2023 campaign in which he guided them to 84 wins and a postseason berth. That earned him National League Manager of the Year honors. After that season, the Marlins under a new front office pivoted to a rebuild, and Schumaker stepped down after a 100-loss season in 2024. Schumaker spent this past season as a senior advisor within the Rangers' baseball operations department. Upon joining the organization, he was widely regarded as the heir apparent to Bochy. </p><p>\"I am honored and excited for this opportunity to manage the Rangers,\" said Schumaker in that same statement. \"While I attained a good understanding of the organization through my front office role this past season, the conversations with Chris Young, Ross Fenstermaker, and others this week have only intensified my interest in this opportunity. I can't wait to begin the work for 2026.\"</p><p>Schumaker inherits a Rangers club with a compelling mix of young and veteran talent. However, the roster disappointed in 2025 with an 81-81 finish and third-place status in the American League West. </p>\n<p>Prior to his coaching, managerial, and front-office career, Schumaker spent parts of 11 seasons as an infielder and outfielder in the majors, mostly with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Nonetheless, Western Kentucky quarterback Maverick McIvor has thrown for 1,474 passing yards with 11 touchdowns. This season, the Hilltoppers are 4-1 ATS in all games, and Delaware is 0-1 ATS as the home favorite. SportsLine's model has the Hilltoppers going on the road and covering the spread in 69% of simulations. </p><h2>West Virginia (+20.5) vs. BYU (-114)</h2><p>The Mountaineers are 2-0 against BYU all-time, but head into this game as massive underdogs. The Cougars have allowed more points defensively each week, which could lead to West Virginia keeping this one closer than people expect. BYU allowed 172 rushing yards last week against Colorado, and that could be an area that West Virginia attacks to keep the Cougars' offense off the field. The SportsLine Projection Model is projecting the Mountaineers to cover the spread in 64% of simulations. </p><h2>New Mexico vs. San Jose State: Over 58.5 total points</h2><p>New Mexico enters this contest averaging 30.5 points and 391 total yards of offense per game. They have poured in 32-plus points in three consecutive games. The Lobos have two players with 235-plus rushing yards and at least two rushing scores. The Spartans have picked up offensively, tallying at least 28 points in back-to-back games. Receiver Danny Scudero has 33 catches for 514 receiving yards and three touchdowns for the Spartans.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Despite a loss from the Los Angeles Chargers and a tie by the Green Bay Packers, Week 4 did not produce much carnage in NFL survivor pools. In all, five of the most popular teams in the Circa Survivor picked up victories. Only the Buffalo Bills threw a scare into players before finally disposing of the pesky New Orleans Saints. Week 5 features four teams favored by seven or more points, including Colts (-7) over Raiders, Cardinals (-7.5) over Titans, Lions (-10.5) over Bengals and Bills (-8.5) over Patriots. </p><p>With the survivor pool shrinking, it's a must that players put together a winning NFL survivor pool strategy. It's all about deciding when to successfully use a team and when to save another.

He has also delivered a 55% hit rate on his Vegas contest picks over the last 10 seasons and has two finishes in the money, including finishing 18th out of 2,748 entries back in 2017. He knows the NFL at a level that few do, making him the perfect expert to give NFL survivor pool strategy tips, and his top pick has survived in all three weeks thus far.</p><p>Now, White has turned his attention to the latest Week 5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/\">NFL odds</a> and locked in his Week 5 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-week-5-survivor-pool-picks-cardinals-or-colts-looks-like-the-key-choice-for-those-saving-elite-teams/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_White_Week5NFLsurvivor\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who White is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins</em></a>:</p><h3>Top Week 5 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>One surprise: The Indianapolis Colts are not his top NFL survivor pick.

Indianapolis is off to a 3-1 start to the season, but White sees a better play for them later in the season.</p><p>This may be one of the best times this season to use the Colts, but White does not see that as sound strategy.

He's $7,800 on DraftKings and $9,000 on FanDuel.</p><p>But after his past two outings, he might not be as popular as normal in DFS. He struggled with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/fantasy/\">Jake Browning</a>, with only 10 catches for 73 yards and no touchdowns on 14 targets combined, but that was on the road at Minnesota and Denver.</p><p>Chase should perform better at home in Week 5 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, who are dealing with injuries in their secondary. I'm expecting a bounce-back game, and Chase could have a squeaky wheel game after he was complaining to Zac Taylor on the sidelines against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>.</p>\n<p>He's too good to continue to struggle, and I'm excited to use Chase in multiple lineups this week.

Game 1 in the best-of-seven series tips off at 8 p.m. ET from Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas. </p><p>Both clubs have familiarity in the championship realm but have taken unlikely paths to reach this destination in the 2025 WNBA season. The Aces have won two of the past three WNBA titles but reshaped their roster following last year's campaign that ended in the semifinals. They were uneven for much of the season before a 53-point loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> on Aug. 2 ignited what would become a 16-game winning streak to end the regular season. </p><p>Las Vegas received a strong challenge from a stubborn <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> club in the semifinals before advancing behind a 107-98 overtime win in Game 5 on Tuesday. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/\">A'Ja Wilson</a>, who just earned her record fourth MVP award, led the way with 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists. </p><p>The Mercury have won three WNBA championships in franchise history, but their most recent title came in 2014. They quietly rebuilt their roster following the retirement of iconic star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105071/diana-taurasi/\">Diana Taurasi</a> and the departure of former center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063686/brittney-griner/\">Brittney Griner</a> to Atlanta. </p><p>Phoenix's biggest in its mini makeover was a multi-team trade in which it acquired perennial All Star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CT/connecticut-sun/\">Connecticut Sun</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/\">Dallas Wings</a>. Even so, the Mercury's strong regular season appeared to go mostly unnoticed by basketball observers, few of whom picked them to do much in the postseason. Predictably, numerous Mercury players used the perceived slight as motivation during this run to the WNBA Finals. </p><p>\"I've been saying since training camp that we were going to the finals,\" Thomas said. \"We don't care about people's opinions. We've stuck together all season. We're going to go out there and play our basketball and fight every game. </p><p>Las Vegas is a 3.5-point betting favorite, and the over/under for total points scored is 160.5 in the WNBA Finals sportsbook odds for Mercury vs. Aces. </p><p>In addition to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, the sporting landscape on Friday includes a handful of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> matchups, and we'll look ahead to Saturday's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> playoff slate. The following is a snapshot of the top games to watch for Friday, Oct. 3. <em>All times Eastern.</em></p><h2>WNBA Finals best bets today, where to watch</h2><h3>Mercury at Aces</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 8 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>Las Vegas | <strong>TV:</strong> ESPN | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/stream/wnba/?irad=1707172&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><p><strong><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-finals-picks-predictions-today-mercury-vs-aces-game-1-best-bets-from-proven-experts-for-friday-oct-3/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a></span> -- Experts: </strong>Mercury +3.5 (Calvin Wetzel and Aaron Barzilai)</p><p>WNBA analysts Calvin Wetzel and Aaron Barzilai say they are leaning toward the underdog Mercury in large part because of their significant advantage in rest. The Mercury have been off since last Sunday when they ousted the Minnesota Lynx 3-1 in the WNBA semifinals, while the Aces could be fatigued physically and mentally following their draining and dramatic overtime victory Tuesday night in Game 5 of the semifinals against the Fever. The WNBA analysts also note that they believe Phoenix coach Nate Tibbetts did an excellent job keeping his players rested throughout the regular season so they would be positioned to play extensive minutes in the postseason. </p><h2>CFB best bets today, where to watch</h2><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WVU/west-virginia-mountaineers/\">West Virginia</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BYU/byu-cougars/\">BYU</a> </h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 10:30 p.m. | <strong>Location:</strong> Provo, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a> | <strong>TV:</strong> ESPN | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<p><strong><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-finals-picks-predictions-today-mercury-vs-aces-game-1-best-bets-from-proven-experts-for-friday-oct-3/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a></span> -- Model:</strong> West Virginia +19.5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Expert: </strong>BYU -18.5 (Bruce <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MRSHL/marshall-thundering-herd/\">Marshall</a>) </p><p>The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Mountaineers, who have suffered back-to-back blowout losses since their upset win over rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PITT/pittsburgh-panthers/\">Pittsburgh</a>, are being disrespected by oddsmakers in this Friday night matchup. The model has a strong play on the underdog plus the points, projecting a 33-21 final score that sees West Virginia covering with room to spare. Its 10,000-game simulation has the Mountaineers covering 64% of the time, a whopping contrast to the implied sportsbook odds of around 52%. </p><p>However, SportsLine CFB expert Bruce Marshall (+267 over his last 35 CFB picks) expects the undefeated Cougars to keep rolling and doesn't see much resistance in store from West Virginia. He expects the Cougars' physicality and solid execution to spark another blowout victory in which they cover the big number. </p>\n<h2>Looking ahead: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a></h2><p><strong>Time:</strong> 2 p.m. Saturday  | <strong>Location:</strong> Milwaukee | <strong>TV:</strong> TBS | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20251004_CHC@MIL/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SportsLine picks</strong></a> -- <strong>Model:</strong> Over 7 runs  | Expert: Brewers -149 (Matt Severance)</p><p>The SportsLine Projection Model has a slight lean to the underdog Cubs in Game 1 of this National League, but its stronger position lies in the Over 7 runs. The model sees an average of 8.3 runs crossing the plate in this matchup, resulting in the Over connecting about 57% of the time. This provides value window versus the implied sportsbook odds of around 52%. </p><p>However, SportsLine <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> expert Matt Severance (+1356 over his last 16 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> picks) is riding with the moderate home favorite in Game 1. He expects an inspired performance from the well-rested Brewers behind ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2900486/freddy-peralta/\">Freddy Peralta</a>, who is 9-1 with a 1.77 ERA at home this season.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Coming up with a winning NFL DFS strategy can go in many different directions, but a popular one is targeting games with the highest project point totals when searching for NFL DFS picks and building NFL DFS stacks. The highest over/under in the NFL odds for Sunday is 49.5 in the Lions vs. Bengals matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups on Sunday include Raiders vs. Colts, Cowboys vs. Jets, and Patriots vs. Bills. Thus, you can expect stars like Jahmyr Gibbs, Jonathan Taylor, George Pickens, Josh Allen, and James Cook to be core players in many NFL DFS lineups.</p><p>Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values. Should players like Jaxson Dart or Jake Browning find their way into your quarterback slot for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Ja'Marr Chase and C.J. Stroud finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=10032025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek5Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/underdog/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Underdog promo code</em></a></span><em>, which </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>may include a play $5, get $100 offer</em></a>:</p><p>The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>.

The former first-round pick out of Duke has gotten off to a strong start in 2025, throwing for 1,078 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions through his first four games, while also tallying three rushing scores, putting him among the more efficient signal-callers in the league thus far. </p><p>In CBS Sports' early fantasy rankings, Jones sits in the QB3–QB4 range thanks to his low turnover rate and rushing upside. With his move to Indianapolis this season, it appears he's revived momentum and is positioning himself as both a reliable fantasy QB and a legitimate leader for the Colts' offense. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=10032025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek5Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><p>The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Giants running back Cam Skattebo ($6,000 on DraftKings and $6,200 on FanDuel). The former Arizona State standout has shown flashes of brilliance as a rookie in 2025, rushing 48 times for 181 yards (3.8 average) and scoring two touchdowns. In CBS Sports' fantasy football analysis, he's received buzz as a potential fantasy breakout player --  especially with the expectation that he'll assume lead back duties. </p><p>At Arizona State and Sacramento State, he compiled 4,386 rushing yards on 709 carries with 43 touchdowns, caught 112 passes for 1,386 yards and eight receiving touchdowns, and even attempted 17 passes -- showcasing his multi-dimensional skill set. As a draft prospect, he was known for his toughness and ability to break tackles. He's already earned multiple Pepsi Rookie of the Week nominations in his first NFL season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=10032025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek5Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to build Sunday Week 5 NFL DFS lineups</h2><p>The NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

The Aggies are 4-0 for the first time since 2016 under second-year coach Mike Elko. The Bulldogs, meanwhile, enter looking to rebound after their first setback of the season -- a gut-wrenching overtime loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a>.</p><p>Elko was quick to defend his team after last week's win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a>, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/texas-a-ms-mike-elko-channels-brian-kelly-in-postgame-jab-at-reporters-after-aggies-win-over-auburn/\" target=\"_blank\">pointing to a suffocating defensive effort</a></span> that held Auburn to just 176 yards and an 0-for-12 mark on third downs with five sacks. Texas A&M will look for another dominant defensive performance against a Mississippi State offense that has shown signs of growth in the second year of the Jeff Lebby era.</p><p>The Bulldogs (4-1) are off to their best start in a decade, but the road ahead is brutal with Texas A&M kicking off a stretch that includes five ranked opponents still left on the SEC slate.</p><h2>Where to watch Texas A&M vs. Mississippi State live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas<br /><strong>TV: </strong>SEC Network | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<h2>Texas A&M vs. Mississippi State: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Star transfer impact:</strong> Former Mississippi State wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391237/mario-craver/\">Mario Craver</a> is the top pass-catcher for Texas A&M after transferring last December. The 5-foot-9, 165-pound sophomore has 24 receptions for 477 yards and four touchdowns -- ranking second nationally in receiving yards per game (119.3).</p><p><strong>Defensive edge:</strong> Texas A&M's pass rush has been one of the most disruptive in the country, averaging 3.5 sacks per game to rank third in the SEC. That strength could loom large against Mississippi State, which has struggled to keep QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168291/blake-shapen/\">Blake Shapen</a> upright and ranks third-worst in the SEC in protection (2.4 sacks allowed per game).

Sophomore back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29132460/fluff-bothwell/\">Fluff Bothwell</a> has been the workhorse, piling up 405 yards and six touchdowns on 70 carries. But he'll be tested against a stout Texas A&M front that ranks 13th nationally in run-play success rate allowed (32.6%), according to TruMedia, setting up a strength-on-strength battle in the trenches.</p>\n<h2>Texas A&M vs. Mississippi State prediction, pick<br /></h2><p>Mississippi State is one of just five teams in the FBS with a perfect record against the spread this season. The betting market still isn't fully adjusting to the Bulldogs' turnaround under Jeff Lebby. Texas A&M may win outright, but this feels like too many points to lay against a confident Mississippi State team looking to bounce back from a loss. <strong><em>Pick: Mississippi State +14.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

However, the SportsLine model has the Mountaineers covering the 20.5-point spread as one of its Friday best bets. It expects multiple underdogs to have competitive evenings, with Colorado State (+5.5) vs. San Diego State and Western Kentucky defeating Delaware at +120 odds among its Friday best bets at DraftKings. Both Western Kentucky (7 p.m. ET) and Colorado State (10:30 p.m. ET) play on CBS Sports Network.

Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of well over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and is a profitable 37-24 combined on money-line and over/under <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">college football picks</a> since the beginning of 2024.

Western Kentucky ranks 16th in the country in passing yards (302 yards per game) while throwing on 58.02% of plays, the 14th-highest pass-play percentage in the nation. Senior quarterback Maverick McIvor threw for 317 yards in a 27-22 win over Missouri State last week. Delaware is allowing 29.3 points per game, which ranks 90th in college football. Western Kentucky has three receivers with more than 230 yards and three running backs with more than 150 rushing yards, making the Hilltoppers a challenging team to gameplan against. The model projects Western Kentucky to win in 66% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds in a 7 p.m. start on CBS Sports Network.</p><h2>West Virginia (+20.5) vs. BYU (-115)</h2><p>The Mountaineers are coming off back-to-back lopsided losses, but the model doesn't expect that trend to continue against BYU. West Virginia is one of the most run-heavy teams in college football, rushing on 60.55% of plays. That is the 17th-most in college football, which is similar to how the offense was run during Rich Rodriguez's first tenure as head coach at the university. The Mountaineers' rushing attack is starting to come together with a roster filled with transfer portal players learning Rodriguez's system for the first time, as West Virginia rushed for 261 yards last week, raising its average to 172.3 rushing yards per game. If West Virginia can control the time of possession, it can keep this game within a few scores to cover the margin. The model projects West Virginia to cover the spread in 64% of simulations.</p><h2>Colorado State (+5.5) vs. San Diego State (-108)</h2><p>Colorado State is 1-3 overall this season, but the Rams are 2-0 against the spread as underdogs this year. Colorado State has one of the better pass defenses in the nation, ranking 40th in passing yards against (196 yards per game) and with San Diego State averaging just 145.7 passing yards per game, 123rd in college football, the Colorado State defense could make enough stands to keep this contest close. Colorado State defeated San Diego State, 22-19, in their last meeting in 2023, and the model projects the Rams to cover the spread in 68% of simulations heading into this 10:30 p.m. ET matchup on CBS Sports Network.</p><h2>Want more college football picks for Friday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Friday best bets.

The matchup feels great for Matthew Stafford, it's simply a matter of how much passing he'll have to do. Remember, the 49ers offense is Christian McCaffrey and a bunch of backups, so this could become a one-sided game. Stafford's thrown at least 33 passes in each of his past three with 41 last week against the Colts' weak secondary. I'd be at least a little worried about Stafford dialing things back and coming up with somewhere between 17 and 21 Fantasy points, which is where he landed in Weeks 2 and 3 on 33 attempts. And here's a little history: In eight divisional matchups against the Niners including the playoffs, Stafford's had two games over 20 Fantasy points, none with 31 or fewer pass attempts. ... This Niners defense also got mauled up front in the run game last week, something that could easily happen again with Kyren Williams turning his usual 19.0 touched per game into a big stat line. </p>\n<p>MUST-STARTS: Christian McCaffrey, Kyren Williams, Puka Nacua, Davante Adams</p><p>STARTS: Rams DST </p><p>SITS: Matthew Stafford (high-end No. 2 QB), Mac Jones, Demarcus Robinson, Kendrick Bourne, Jake Tonges, Blake Corum (desperation RB), Tutu Atwell, Brian Robinson Jr., 49ers DST</p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Save for one play where they were completely out of position, the Vikings made Aaron Rodgers look really mediocre. You could certainly argue Rodgers himself has looked mediocre since Week 2, but the point is that the Vikings are one of the league's most hyper-aggressive defenses, and now they'll take on third-round rookie Dillon Gabriel in his first NFL start. The 24-year-old played 64 college games, improving his completion rate as he got older, including on throws over 15 air yards (55.7% completion rate last year, 54% the year before, both are good). Nearly all of what he's done in mop-up duty and in most of the preseason has been keeping his throws short, while the Browns kept his reads simple. He can move around the pocket to extend plays, and he definitely had an eye for downfield throws in college, but there's nothing about the matchup that makes Gabriel or any Browns players outside of Quinshon Judkins reliable for Fantasy purposes. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Justin Jefferson</p><p>STARTS: Quinshon Judkins, Jordan Mason, T.J.

It should also be noted that Marks has overtaken the third-down work for Houston for multiple weeks already. Nick Chubb will still get some touches, but I expect the Texans to lean into Marks' versatility to help take pressure off of C.J. Stroud, who also played much more comfortably last week. Now when the schedule came out, this matchup was a reason to fear any Texans runners, but since the start of the year the Ravens have lost two starting defensive linemen, including tackle Nnamdi Madubuike, starting inside linebacker Roquan Smith and just for good measure two starting cornerbacks in Nate Wiggins and Marlon Humphrey (a third, Chidobe Awuzie, is also possible). The bottom line: Against the Ravens, James Cook had 21.2 PPR points, both Lions running backs each had 26-plus PPR points, three Browns running backs each had 10 PPR points and Pacheco had 12.8 PPR points while Kareem Hunt and Brashard Smith totaled 12.3 PPR points. That means each <em>team</em> notched at least 25 PPR points each. After what we saw last week, Houston's duo -- led by Marks -- should get close. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Nico Collins, Derrick Henry </p><p>STARTS: Woody Marks (No. 2 RB), Zay Flowers, Texans DST</p><p>SITS: C.J.

Three of the four lead RBs to face the Dolphins this season have scored at least 16 PPR points, including Breece Hall on Monday and Rhamondre Stevenson in Week 2. Dowdle is the former 1,000-yard rusher of the Cowboys who had been making in-roads on Hubbard's role over the past two games. A notable concern: As bad as the Dolphins run defense is, the Panthers offensive line has contributed to a downswing, especially after Robert Hunt's injury. Excluding garbage time runs, the Panthers' backs as a whole have averaged 3.7 yards per carry and a below-average 1.2 yards before contact per rush average since Hunt's been out. Dowdle is worth starting solely for the workload and the matchup, not for the rest of the Panthers run offense. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: De'Von Achane</p><p>STARTS: Jaylen Waddle (No. 2 WR), Rico Dowdle, Tetairoa McMillan, Darren Waller (low-end TE)</p><p>SITS: Tua Tagovailoa (high-end No. 2 QB), Bryce Young (matchup-based sleeper), Tommy Tremble (high-end No. 2 TE), Malik Washington (stash), Ollie Gordon II (stash), Dolphins DST, Panthers DST</p>\n<div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Even with all the highlights you've seen of Maxx Crosby wrecking offenses, pass rush pressure has been a problem for the Raiders. They've been under a 32% pressure rate in each of their past three games, including two where they blitzed at high rates (37.5% versus the Chargers, 40.9% at the Commanders). Pair that with the Raiders reliably utilizing heavy zone coverage, doing so at the second-highest rate in the league, and especially playing Cover-3, and Daniel Jones should have a bounce-back game. Jones has a much higher completion rate and TD rate, not to mention ADOT, when not pressured, and this season he's third among qualifying quarterbacks in yards per attempt (11.3) against Cover-3 coverage. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Jonathan Taylor, Brock Bowers</p><p>STARTS: Daniel Jones, Ashton Jeanty, Michael Pittman, Jakobi Meyers, Tyler Warren, Colts DST</p><p>SITS: Geno Smith, Alec Pierce (desperation WR), Josh Downs, Tre Tucker, Raiders DST</p>\n<div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>There were moments last week where Jaxson Dart looked a little panicked, like the play he ran right into a defender's body for a sack. But there were far more plays where he played smart, followed basic concepts well and ultimately maneuvered in around and out of the pocket like a veteran, not a rookie. There's one concern: Dart was pressured on 10 dropbacks last week, went 0 for 4 passing and was sacked five times. The Saints haven't generated much pressure this season, but last week they tried by playing more man-to-man coverage at Buffalo and blitzing Josh Allen a bunch. It was out of character for them compared to the first three weeks of the season, but it might be part of their plan for how they go about trying to affect Dart this week. This is an easy matchup -- all four QBs to play the Saints have scored at least 20 Fantasy points -- but Dart's still not worth confidently starting due to his inexperience, lack of elite receivers and lack of a high statistical ceiling. </p><p>STARTS: Cam Skattebo, Alvin Kamara, Juwan Johnson, Giants DST</p><p>FLEX: Chris Olave (especially in PPR), Darius Slayton, Wan'Dale Robinson (PPR flex)</p><p>SITS: Jaxson Dart (high-end No. 2 QB), Spencer Rattler, Rashid Shaheed (low-end flex), Kendre Miller (stash), Theo Johnson, Devin Singletary, Saints DST</p>\n<div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>For all the pass rush pressure the Cowboys mustered up last week in five quarters against a depleted Packers offensive line, they had one sack and allowed a quarterback at least 2.8 seconds on average to throw. But get ready for the resistible force to meet the movable objects because the Jets offensive line has allowed a 51.8% pass rush pressure rate through four games, higher than any other team. On the flip side, the Jets have two sacks in their past three games (none against the Dolphins!) and Dallas' O-line is middle of the pack in pass rush pressure rate allowed but fifth-best in sack rate allowed (3.4%), which is especially impressive since they took on the Packers last Sunday. If both teams have time to throw, and both teams should be able to run the ball effectively, then there really aren't any players in the matchup to be nervous to start. That includes George Pickens and his 25% target per route run rate in his past two games without CeeDee Lamb -- Sauce Gardner's allowed a 50% catch rate but also 14.1 yards per catch, so there's room for Pickens to be a No. 2 receiver. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Breece Hall, Garrett Wilson, George Pickens (No. 2 WR)</p><p>STARTS: Justin Fields, Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, Jake Ferguson</p><p>SITS: Mason Taylor (high-end No. 2 TE), Jalen Tolbert (desperation WR), KaVontae Turpin, Isaiah Davis (decent stash), Josh Reynolds, Miles Sanders, Cowboys DST, Jets DST</p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Before you get excited over the 41% snap share R.J. Harvey had last week, note that 14 of his 33 snaps came in the fourth quarter when the Broncos were up 21-3 and in total control of the game. That does mean Harvey did play 32% of the snaps in the first three quarters, which is basically in line with what he played in Weeks 1 and 2. What is worth getting excited about is an uptick in targets and catches for Harvey over the past two weeks (eight targets for a 7-54-1 receiving line). Half of the targets were either designed plays or plays where he was part of the progression, not check-downs, which is encouraging. The Eagles typically play a lot of zone on first and second down before moving toward man-to-man coverage on third down, and they tend to get a lot of pressure without blitzing. If Nix is going to have a hard time throwing downfield, and if he's pressured a lot, then Harvey might continue to see a handful of targets to go along with a handful of carries. And if the Broncos trail, perhaps Harvey sees more snaps since he appears to be a preferred target out of the backfield.  </p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY P.M. UPDATE:</strong> You can make the case that Quinyon Mitchell will shadow Courtland Sutton when Sutton lines up wide. We've seen that from Mitchell a bunch, including last week when he held Emeka Egbuka to two catches for six yards over six targets (Egbuka's big touchdown was credited against rookie safety Andrew Mukuba). Mitchell has allowed a 44.4% catch rate in coverage this season with just 7.3 yards per catch and no touchdowns allowed. Naturally, that limits the upside Sutton would have and should put him in No. 2 receiver territory at best. ... Bo Nix would also be hurt by this shadow coverage as he'll be forced to consider throwing to other teammates. It's a plus that he's been sacked just three times all year thanks to a really great O-line. The Eagles are not known for bringing heavy blitzes so Nix should be able to throw as much as he needs. He just has a weak 6.6-yard ADOT and entered Week 5 leading the league in screen passes. Might the Broncos be bold enough to try Marvin Mims or Troy Franklin in coverage against Eagles cornerback Adoree Jackson, who has struggled far more than both Mitchell and slot corner Cooper DeJean? Or will the Broncos stick with a bunch of short throws? Either way, it feels like a week where Nix's numbers will be stunted. Be careful trusting him. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley</p><p>STARTS: Courtland Sutton, JK Dobbins (No. 2 RB), A.J.

Demercado has rarely been given the chance to be a feature back -- he's excelled in pass protection (playcaller Drew Petzing talked about that this week) and is a solid receiver. Demercado has three career games with 10-plus touches, all in 2023, and all when the Cardinals seemingly had no other options they could trust. It is worth noting he took<em> all</em> of Arizona's snaps inside the 10-yard line late last week<em> after Benson got hurt </em>and even scored on a reception. If he keeps that role he'll be valuable moving forward, but if Carter is the Cardinals running-downs back in a matchup against a terrible Titans run defense then for one week <em>he's</em> the better play over Demercado. The Titans defense ranked fifth-worst in defensive total rush EPA, third-worst in explosive runs allowed (11.7%) with 5.0 yards per carry given up and six rushing touchdowns to running backs through four games. I wouldn't feel confident starting any Cardinals running back this week but I'd give a slight lean to Carter, especially in half- and non-PPR leagues. When the Cardinals play at Indy and Green Bay in Weeks 6 and 7 you can expect more playing time and decent stats from Demercado.</p><p>MUST-STARTS: Trey McBride</p><p>STARTS: Kyler Murray, Marvin Harrison Jr., Cardinals DST</p><p>FLEX: Tony Pollard, Michael Carter, Elic Ayomanor (low-end PPR flex)</p><p>SITS: Cam Ward, Emari Demercado (stash), Calvin Ridley, Greg Dortch, Michael Wilson, Chig Okonkwo, Titans DST</p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Expect Rachaad White to see a majority of the snaps with Sean Tucker pitching in more on run-downs than anywhere else. White has already hovered around 30% of the snaps from week to week, closer to 40% on third downs. I can't imagine Tucker playing passing downs much, especially with Tampa Bay's offensive line so tattered. If Tucker gets hot running the ball (like he did in Week 6 last year while splitting work with a then-unknown Irving) then he'll make some serious inroads on taking touches away from White, who averaged 2.6 yards in 11 carries against the Jets and Eagles. Neither should be heavily trusted versus a Seahawks run defense that's let up just 3.3 yards per carry and zero rush touchdowns with a league-best ranking in defense total rush EPA. However, two running backs have had big games against them in PPR thanks to their receptions: Christian McCaffrey (nine catches and 142 total yards) and Jaylen Warren (four catches and 134 total yards). It keeps the door open for White to be solid. </p>\n<p>As last week's game rolled along, Chris Godwin began separating with some speed on top of all the other ways we've seen him move away from defenders before. One specific play saw Godwin get a step on his man and streak across the end zone with his hand up, only to find Baker Mayfield under pressure and then underthrow him for an interception. His role in his first game was encouraging: 55 snaps with most of them out wide, 93% route rate, 10 targets and a surprising 14.6-yard average depth of target. The stats were bad, though, which doesn't help him in this week's matchup at the Seahawks. Wideouts have averaged a third-lowest 1.31 PPR points per target against them with Marvin Harrison and Chris Olave (10-plus targets each) finding Fantasy success. Godwin is no better than a flex. </p><p><strong>FRIDAY P.M. UPDATE:</strong> Seahawks slot cornerback Devon Witherspoon has been ruled out. Sterling Shepard has played the most slot snaps for the Bucs this season, but Witherspoon's absence could easily push the Bucs to shift Godwin and/or Egbuka into the slot. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Jaxon Smith-Njigba</p><p>STARTS: Baker Mayfield (low-end starter), Emeka Egbuka, Kenneth Walker III (No. 2 RB), Rachaad White (low-end No. 2 RB in PPR), Seahawks DST</p><p>FLEX: Chris Godwin, Zach Charbonnet (low-end flex)</p><p>SITS: Sam Darnold (high-end No. 2 QB), Sean Tucker (desperation RB worth stashing), Cooper Kupp (desperation PPR flex), Tory Horton (desperation flex), A.J.

Reed out and cornerback Terrion Arnold uncertain for Sunday, we could see a tough matchup become a little easier for the Bengals amazing receiving duo. Amik Robertson and Rock Ya-Sin are veteran cover guys, but neither are solid enough to consistently haggle Ja'Marr Chase or Tee Higgins like the Broncos cornerbacks did last week. That means the Bengals <em>must</em> protect Jake Browning really well for their receivers to have a shot at doing anything good this week. That'll be a challenge: The Lions blitz at the second-highest rate (41.4% of snaps) and are second in sacks (14) and first in sack rate (10.6% of dropbacks). You may have been able to guess that the Bengals offensive line has allowed the fifth-highest pass rush pressure rate this year with 13 sacks to boot. All but eight of Browning's 25 pass attempts were out of his hands inside of 2.5 seconds; of the remaining 17, 12 were completed for just 5.5 yards per attempt. The Bengals receivers may have a couple of big plays because of the depleted Lions secondary, but a big week for the entire passing offense still seems unlikely. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Ja'Marr Chase (No. 2 WR), </p><p>STARTS: Jared Goff (low-end starter), David Montgomery, Chase Brown (low-end No. 2 RB), Sam LaPorta (middle-end TE), Lions DST </p><p>FLEX: Tee Higgins, Jameson Williams </p><p>SITS: Jake Browning, Mike Gesicki, Andrei Iosivas, Isaac TeSlaa, Samaje Perine, Bengals DST</p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>Things have been bad for Ladd McConkey, especially last week when he had some drops on targets he was reeling in last year. He's moving as quickly as ever, but his lack of splash plays (Quentin Johnston has taken many of those) and a lack of heavy target volume (Keenan Allen and Johnston have taken many of those) have turned him into a lesser Fantasy option. Even when Justin Herbert's been pressured McConkey's had a weak 13.2% target per route run rate (Keenan Allen's at 19.3%). I bring that up because Herbert figures to be under pressure versus the Commanders now that tackle Joe Alt is out. The Commanders aren't typically blitz heavy but rank ninth in pass rush pressure rate and have scored 10 sacks so far. If there's a glimmer of hope it's that the Commanders have struggled against receivers lined up in the slot this year, yielding 14.2 yards per catch and 2.11 PPR points per target. Problem is that Allen equally benefits. You might be better off leaving McConkey on your bench if you can. </p><p>STARTS: Jayden Daniels, Justin Herbert, Omarion Hampton (No. 1 RB), Quentin Johnston, Deebo Samuel, Keenan Allen (low-end No. 2 PPR WR), Zach Ertz</p><p>FLEX: Ladd McConkey (PPR)</p><p>SITS: Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Chris Rodriguez, Jeremy McNichols, Luke McCaffrey, Oronde Gadsden (deep stash), Chargers DST, Commanders DST</p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>I wouldn't say Stefon Diggs ran as fast as he used to, but he was stealthy with his route running, often separating from Panthers cornerback Mike Jackson because of his footwork. Diggs ramped up in Week 4, setting season-highs in route rate (82%, way higher than before), target share (41.2% was crazy) and of course Fantasy points (16.1 PPR points). I especially liked that he still played in slot a lot and found ways to make himself an available target against zone coverage. This was in a game Drake Maye threw 17 times in -- he's probably going to have to throw more this week at Buffalo. The Bills have had some issues with receivers -- Christian Benford has allowed four touchdowns this year -- so there should be opportunities for Diggs to keep his numbers moderately hot. </p><p>MUST-STARTS: Josh Allen, James Cook</p><p>STARTS: Drake Maye, Stefon Diggs (low-end No. 2 WR in PPR), Dalton Kincaid, Hunter Henry Bills DST (low-end DST)</p><p>FLEX: Khalil Shakir (No. 3 WR), TreVeyon Henderson</p><p>SITS: Rhamondre Stevenson, Keon Coleman, Kayshon Boutte, Josh Palmer, Demario Douglas, Antonio Gibson, Ray Davis, Patriots DST</p><div>\n                    <p>\n                Start 'em\n            </p>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n                10.0-7.00\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                6.99 - 5.01\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                5.00 - 0\n            </p>\n        </div>\n                    <p>\n                Sit 'em\n            </p>\n            </div>\n<p>The good news is that Brian Thomas Jr. made fewer mistakes last week than the week before. The bad news is that the Jaguars didn't need Thomas to upend the 49ers as Trevor Lawrence didn't face much pressure and didn't push the ball much downfield. This week figures to be much more challenging for the Jaguars on two fronts: One, the Chiefs are among the pressure-heaviest defenses in the league, and two, they're generally unpredictable with their coverages. That's a bad combination for Lawrence, who is still not a pristine processor. And it's very likely the Chiefs will still direct tight coverage on Thomas even though he hasn't been super this season. Lawrence hasn't played the Chiefs since 2023 but he's been under 16 Fantasy points in his last two against them. I'd be concerned about Thomas and Lawrence having solid weeks. </p><p>STARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Travis Etienne, Xavier Worthy, Travis Kelce (low-end No. 2 TE), Brenton Strange (low-end No. 2 TE), Chiefs DST</p><p>FLEX: Brian Thomas Jr., Marquise Brown (low-end PPR flex)</p><p>SITS: Trevor Lawrence, Tyquan Thornton, Kareem Hunt, Isiah Pacheco, Travis Hunter, Bhayshul Tuten, Brashard Smith (stash), Jaguars DST </p>\n            </div>",

The fifth-round pick out of Texas had been inactive for the first four games of the season with an ankle injury slowing his early preparation and limiting his opportunities to practice fully.</p><p>However, an unusual footwear decision this week almost derailed things. During Thursday practice, Blue debuted a flashy pair of blue-and-white Louis Vuitton Nike cleats. While they may have looked stylish, they quickly caused trouble. Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer recounted seeing the rookie sitting on the sidelines mid-practice, complaining of blisters.</p><p>\"A little questionable decision. He went out there with some cool, new cleats -- Louis Vuitton, Nike's. They give you blisters. So about halfway through practice, I saw him laying down, and I was like, 'What the hell happened to Blue?'\" <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rookie-rb-jaydon-blue-very-excited-to-likely-make-cowboys-debut-vs-jets-in-week-5/\" target=\"_blank\">Schottenheimer said</a></span>. \"'Well Coach I'm fine, I have blisters.' I was like, 'Oh shocker, look at your cool shoes you got.' That's part of what you deal with with young players. Quickly, he changed the cleats.\"</p>\n<p>Blue said one of the blisters on his heel was \"really bad.\"</p>\n<p>\"One of them was really bad, and the other one wasn't as bad. ... It was good at the beginning of practice, and then all of the sudden they just started hurting,\" Blue said. \"I had to take them off, it was bad.\"</p><p>Despite the hiccup with his footwear, there are no concerns about Blue's availability for Sunday. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251305/miles-sanders/\">Miles Sanders</a>' status uncertain and kick returner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180870/kavontae-turpin/\">KaVontae Turpin</a> still recovering, the Cowboys may utilize Blue as both a running back and an option on special teams. His versatility and athleticism allow him to contribute in multiple roles could make him a key piece in filling the gaps left by injuries.</p>\n<p>For Blue, this debut represents a milestone after a slow start to his professional career. While the Louis Vuitton cleats may not make it into game day, his speed could give the Cowboys an added spark as they travel to MetLife Stadium for Week 5.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SMU/smu-mustangs/\">SMU</a> is set to open its 2025 ACC slate Saturday afternoon when it welcomes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CUSE/syracuse-orange/\">Syracuse</a> to Dallas, Texas. Though the two teams now share a conference thanks to the latest wave of realignment and expansion, this will be just the second meeting all-time between the Mustangs and the Orange and the first game between the two in almost 100 years. </p><p>SMU holds a 1-0 record in the \"series\" thanks to a 16-6 win on Oct. 15, 1932. This is SMU's second year in the ACC. The Mustangs were dominant in their debut season, finishing 2024 conference play with an 8-0 record, but they're off to a rocky start in their second go-around as a Power Four program. </p><p>SMU is 0-2 against power conference-level competition through four games. Its only two wins came against FCS <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TAMC/east-texas-am-lions/\">East Texas A&M</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MOST/missouri-state-bears/\">Missouri State</a>, which is in its first season at the FBS level. </p><p>It's been a similarly lackluster start for Syracuse, fresh off a year in which it won 10 games for just the third time since the turn of the century. The Orange did upset <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> -- though the Tigers are in a major slump -- but they've lost their other two games against Power Four competition by an average margin of 27 points. </p><p>Both teams will be looking to get right as they take the field in Week 6. </p>\n<h2>Where to watch SMU vs. Syracuse live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 4 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Gerald J. Ford Stadium -- Dallas, Texas<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ACC Network | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>SMU vs. Syracuse: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Can Syracuse get back on track? </strong>Syracuse boasted one of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> most explosive offenses through the first few game of the season, but the Orange hit a major road bump when they scored just three points in a Week 5 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/DUKE/duke-blue-devils/\">Duke</a>. Losing quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876339/steve-angeli/\">Steve Angeli</a>, who was on track for a breakout season, to an Achilles tear against Clemson didn't help matters. New No. 1 QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124210/rickie-collins/\">Rickie Collins</a> really struggled in his first start, throwing for 229 yards and one interception. SMU does provide a nice opportunity for Collins to bounce back. The Mustangs have the worst pass defense in the ACC while allowing 334.5 yards per game.  </p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915317/kevin-jennings/\">Kevin Jennings</a> had a chance to get healthy: </strong>SMU star quarterback Kevin Jennings has been quite banged up this year, though he has started every game for his team thus far. He injured his angle in overtime of SMU's Week 2 game against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a>, he was spotted clutching at his calf against Missouri State, and it appeared as if he aggravated that same ankle injury in SMU's last game versus <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a>. Luckily for the Mustangs, they're coming off a much-needed bye week that allowed Jennings some extra time to get healthy entering their ACC opener. </p><p><strong>SMU's encore:</strong> Though SMU's 2025 campaign got off to a rough start, the Mustangs have a clean slate once the ACC begins. They're looking to make a repeat appearance in the ACC Championship Game after finishing the 2024 regular season undefeated in conference play. The path is there for SMU to match that effort. The ACC is in a bit of slump this year, which means that SMU has to play just one ranked conference opponent -- No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> -- and it gets that game at home. The Mustangs do have to travel to play Clemson, but the Tigers are spiraling. </p>\n<h2>SMU vs. Syracuse prediction, pick<br /></h2><p>Syracuse's latest loss to Duke has reset the calculus on its season a bit. It certainly wasn't the ACC debut that this squad wanted, but the Orange are still a solid team. They've got the offensive firepower to keep pace with SMU. Collins does need to settle in some, but there's no doubting the support system around him. SMU should definitely win this game. The final score will likely be a little closer than oddsmakers would have you think. <strong><em>Pick: Syracuse +17.5 (-114)</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations.

It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.OpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service. The company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.   \nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.

It's not hard to move your following list over; you can upload (almost) all of your old tweets if you want; and the scrolling and posting experience is almost identical to what you'll remember from the old days of Twitter. The only feature I've missed? Drafts.Finally, drafts have arrived. In a post to the official Bluesky account, the company announced that it's added drafts to the platform, and that they're rolling out now. To create a draft, just start writing a post, and instead of tapping the Post button, hit Cancel or Drafts instead and choose Save draft. What you've written will be saved as a draft that you can return to later. The feature works for pre-written threads, too (made using the + button on the post screen). To see your saved drafts, open a blank post and hit Drafts before typing anything else. You'll see a list of your stored drafts, and you can either tap on a draft to open it, or hit the three-dots button to the right of the drift and then Discard to delete it.Drafts were a big part of Twitter for me—not just because they helped save posts if my connection dropped in the middle of writing them, but because they also gave me some time to consider if I really wanted to post something before taking it live. It's a handy feature for a platform with such a small character limit, where it might be easy to toss a stray thought out into the ether without really knowing how it might land or if you've expressed yourself as well as you could have. \nI'm not alone, here: A common trend on Twitter was posting screenshots of draft libraries, to give your followers a peak at the half-formed ideas you didn't think were quite ready for prime time. It's a bit of culture I've missed in moving over to the new site, and I'm glad it's now possible once agin.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for where Bluesky could go next, responses to the drafts announcement include requests for more robust DMs or an edit button, although Bluesky staffers have expressed both logistical and ethical concerns with implementing these. In the meantime, there are third-party tools that try to add some of this functionality, but they do come with wonky formatting that an official solution could probably avoid.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The first lets users request that Google remove sensitive government ID information from Search, while the second gives users new tools to request the same for non-consensual explicit images. Google's \"Results about you\" tool is getting an update\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nFirst, Google is updating its existing \"Results about you\" tool, which helps users scour the internet for their personal information. Before today, this tool could already locate data points like your name, phone number, email addresses, and home addresses. Following the update, you can now find and request the deletion of search results containing highly sensitive information, including your driver's license, passport, or Social Security number.To launch this tool, click here. If you've never used \"Results about you\" before, you'll need to set it up to tell Google what to look out for. Once you do, you'll be able to add government ID numbers, such as your driver's license, passport, and Social Security number. If Google finds a match, the company will let you know. You can receive an alert from the Google app on your smartphone, which takes you to a summary of what data was found and where. From here, you can choose from \"Request to remove,\" or \"Mark as reviewed.\"  \nUnfortunately, this tool won't remove the data from the websites that are hosting it, but it will eventually remove the search results—sharply reducing the chance that someone will find your data on their own. Google says these changes will roll out in the U.S. over the \"coming days,\" while it is working on bringing them to other countries in the future.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's simpler way to remove explicit images from Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIn addition to these changes, Google is now rolling out a simpler tool for users to request the remove of non-consensual explicit images (NCEI) from Search. If you find such an image on Search, you can tap the three dots on that image, choose \"remove result,\" then \"it shows a sexual image of me.\" You'll have the choice to report whether the photo is real, or is artificially generated, as well, and you can report multiple images at once, if needed. Your requests will all appear in the Results about you hub, so you can track the progress of each.The tool lets you opt-in to an option that will filter additional explicit results in other searches. Google says it will also share links to \"emotional and legal support\" after you submit a request.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men. Carefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight. Men can have eating disorders, tooBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness. Unfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"Unsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent. We all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.What’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.Unattainable beauty standards stay unattainableBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation.  “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty  regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor. What does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.As a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.The bottom lineThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement? Women have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.\n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

A new spyware platform known as ZeroDayRAT is reportedly being sold on Telegram, complete with customer support and updates. According to mobile security company iVerify, this aggressive spyware grants full remote control over devices running Android 15 through 16 and iOS versions up to iOS 26. Once deployed, it allows everything from user profiling and location tracking to live surveillance and financial theft. What ZeroDayRAT can gather from your deviceThis spyware has wide-ranging capabilities that, according to iVerify, have traditionally been found on platforms sponsored by state actors. Here's a look at what ZeroDayRAT can do: \nCollect information about the device, such as model, OS, battery, country, lock status, SIM and carrier info, app usage, live activity, and SMS message previews. This allows threat actors to develop user profiles for further targeting.Pull GPS coordinates, capture notifications from apps and systems, and harvest account information, such as usernames and emails. Send SMS messages and receive verification codes to bypass two-factor authentication. Log keystrokes (including biometric unlocks, gestures, and app launches), access the camera and microphone, and screen record.  Log crypto wallet addresses and target banking and payment app credentials via overlay attacks. How to protect against spywareZeroDayRAT can infect your device only if a malicious binary—an APK on Android or iOS payload—is downloaded and installed. These may be distributed through phishing, such as links sent via emails, texts, or messaging platforms, as well as in fake app stores. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll standard guidance for avoiding scams and malware applies: never click links in unsolicited communication, including conversations in apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, and only download apps and extensions from official, trusted sources. Users at high risk of being targeted and anyone who wants an extra layer of security can consider enabling Lockdown Mode (iOS) or Advanced Protection (Android). \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Most of the online services providing access to traditional TV, however, don't allow you to only subscribe to sports. That's going to change.Today YouTube TV announced new plans that are a little bit cheaper than the current cost of $82.99 per month. Among them is a $64.99-per-month Sports plan, which includes access to the big national sports channels including FS1, NBC Sports Network, and all of the ESPN channels, along with access to network television. Basically, if a game is broadcast nationally, this package should give you access. And it will eventually give you access to many out-of-market—the post mentions that ESPN Unlimited will be part of the bundle starting in the fall.The new plan is only an $18 discount over the \"main\" YouTube TV plan, but if you're already paying for YouTube TV and are only ever watching sports, this could be a nice discount, particularly if you get access to ESPN Unlimited. \nThere are a few other discounted plans included in the announcement: The Sports + News package adds CNBC, Fox News, MSNow (formerly MSNBC), CNN, and more to the sports bundle, and costs $71.99. That's only $11 cheaper than the full plan, but is still a nice discount if you were only watching sports and news.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut maybe the biggest savings are for people who don't want to watch sports at all. The Entertainment plan costs $54.99, which is $28 cheaper than the main plan ($336 cheaper per year). If you only watch entertainment channels, with no news or sports, this is the package to look into.There will be more than 10 plans like this rolling out in the next few weeks, according to YouTube TV. I've long dreamed of a world where I could pay only for the cable channels I care about at an affordable rate. This isn't perfect, but it's a bit closer than what YouTube TV offered before.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Malwarebytes Labs has identified a new scam in which threat actors are using party invites to trick users into installing a remote access tool (RAT) that gives them full control over infected devices. (This specific campaign seems to be limited to the UK, but similar tactics could easily spread.) These malicious invites contain a ScreenConnect installerThe scam starts with an innocuous-looking email invitation with an informal \"Save the Date\" vibe that may appear to come from a friend or acquaintance. The message contains a link to \"View Invitation\" for event details. If you click through, you'll end up on a landing page with a bold \"You're Invited\" header and a button to download your invitation, but you don't actually need to take any further action—your browser automatically triggers the download of a .msi file, which is not actually a party invitation or RSVP form but an installer. The MSI silently installs ScreenConnect Client, a legitimate IT support tool that allows remote access into the user's machine. Once this connection is established, attackers have the ability to see your screen, control your mouse and keyboard, and upload or download files—even if you restart your computer. All of this happens in the background with no obvious indicators that a remote access tool has been installed and is now running, so victims are unlikely to have cause for concern. \nYou should know these remote access red flagsAs Malwarebytes points out, this scheme is successful because it relies on normal human behavior around a seemingly low-risk situation: opening an event invitation. What's unusual is that there's little pressure or urgency in the initial message. Instead, the landing page has language like \"a friend has sent you an invitation\" and \"I opened mine and it was so easy,\" which is a form of social proof that guides users to take the desired action. You should always be alert to unsolicited invites sent via regular email with a link to an external site as well as any communication that prompts you to download or install software. These days, invitations are commonly delivered through apps and digital services like Partiful, Paperless Post, Evite, or Apple Invites, which are generally more trustworthy than random emails with hyperlinked text. If you're unsure whether the invite is real, verify with the sender through another channel before clicking or downloading anything. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs mentioned, victims of this scam may not immediately notice that a RAT has been installed on their device. But there are some red flags, such as unexplained cursor movement or windows opening or closing on their own. You can check your machine for a file named \"RSVPPartyInvitationCard.msi\" or a service called ScreenConnect Client with additional random characters in the title.  If you've already downloaded ScreenConnect from a malicious invite, Malwarebytes recommends disconnecting from the internet and uninstalling the program immediately. Run a security scan to check your device for malware, and change important passwords from a separate device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The app has over three billion monthly active users, constantly messaging and calling one another across the globe. However, currently those calls are all happening over the mobile app, or maybe the desktop app. Though WhatsApp does have a web app, the service has never supported audio or video calls outside of its downloadable apps—until now. You can now make calls from the WhatsApp web appAccording to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is slowly rolling out audio and video calls to its web app. At launch, the functionality is coming to individual chats with users who elect to enroll in the WhatsApp web app's beta, but the company plans to roll out the feature to all web app users over the coming weeks.WABetaInfo notes that voice and audio calls work about the same as they do in the WhatsApp desktop app. When you open an individual chat in the web app, you'll now see a video call icon at the top. Click this, and you'll find two options: one to place a voice call, and one to place a video call. These calls are still end-to-end encrypted, as they are on WhatsApp's desktop and mobile apps, meaning only the users who are a part of the calls can hear what's being said. In addition, the web app's video call client supports Screen Share, so you can share a live stream of your computer's screen to another WhatsApp contact. \nWhatsApp is also reportedly working on group chat calls for web app users, as well. While that feature won't roll out alongside individual calls, when it does launch, you'll be able to join group chats with up to 32 people. If you tend to use the WhatsApp desktop or mobile apps, this might not seem like huge news—but it is pretty substantial for a few subsets of WhatsApp users. One, of course, is the user base that just prefers using WhatsApp in their computer's web browser—but the other is Linux users. WhatsApp doesn't actually offer a version of its desktop app for Linux, so those users have to use the web app if they want to run WhatsApp on their computers. That means they've never before been able to place calls without pulling out a mobile device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sign up for the WhatsApp web app betaThis feature will soon roll out to all web app users, but until then, you need to be running the WhatsApp web app beta in order to try it.Luckily, it's pretty easy to get up and running. To start, open the web app, then head to the settings menu, choose \"Help,\" then choose the \"Join beta\" option. This will immediately switch you over to the beta version of the web app. (You should see a \"Beta\" label on your screen.) Now that you're running the beta, should you find the option to place calls in individual chats. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.Chat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.The problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you often feel low on energy, one of the first things you should ask yourself is how much sleep you're getting. Good sleep also helps our overall health, our recovery from exercise, our ability to focus, and more. And while there are plenty of gadgets and biohacks that claim to help, the fundamentals of sleep hygiene are basic and simple. How to know if you need more sleepMost adults need seven to nine hours of sleep, on average, each night. This varies: you might be a seven-hour person or a nine-hour person. (Young people usually need even more; older adults may be okay with less.) So if you’re feeling tired all the time, an easy gut check is to note how much time you spend in bed, on average. If it's fewer than seven hours, it's probably not enough. And even if it's within that seven- to nine-hour window, try getting an extra hour or two of sleep for a few days in a row. If you feel a lot better, you have your answer. Wearables like smartwatches and rings can help collect data, but remember that the main thing they can tell you is how much sleep you're getting. (Sleep \"quality\" scores and even sleep stages are not necessarily reliable.) To call out a few of my favorites: the Oura ring is pricey ($349-$499) but comfortable to wear and presents data nicely. The Amazfit Helio Strap is a bargain at $99 and can track workouts, too. Garmin's Index Sleep Band ($169) is built for comfort while you sleep, but gives the same data as Garmin watches, so you may just want to find a watch you like and stick with that. If you have trouble waking up on time but easily fall asleep when you’re sitting quietly (like watching a movie), that's another sign you're probably not getting enough sleep. If you sleep in when you get the chance, your wake-up time is another hint. If you sleep in two hours or more past your normal time, that's your body applying a short-term fix (getting enough sleep now) to a long-term problem (chronically getting too little sleep). If you know you should sleep more, but you can’t seem to figure out how, below are the basics of sleep hygiene you need to master.Stick to a sleep scheduleSet a wake-up time that you can stick to every day. Consistency is important here: don’t set the alarm for 6 a.m. on weekdays and sleep until noon on weekends. If you can’t be perfectly consistent—for example, if you work different shifts—adjust as needed, but try to do your best. Next comes setting a bedtime. Figure out what time you need to hit the hay to get enough sleep before your alarm goes off. Then work backward from that to figure out when to start changing into jammies and whatever else your nighttime routine involves. (More on that routine below.)Crucial to both steps is prioritizing sleep so you can actually get yourself on schedule. If you’ve been having trouble getting enough sleep lately, give yourself a week or two to make your bedtime and wake-up time (and nine or so hours in between) the highest priority appointments in your calendar. Don’t go out too late, and don’t stay up revenge procrastinating. There will be time for occasional indulgences once your everyday schedule is more consistent. Include these four things in your bedtime routineOkay, so what goes into that routine? Feel free to personalize the specifics, but sleep experts recommend that you include the following as basic building blocks: At least 30 minutes dedicated to winding down. Don’t expect to switch off the lights and instantly be able to zonk out.No screens right before bedtime. No, not even with blue-blocking glasses. Those glasses don’t actually block very much blue light anyway. Videos and social media keep your brain awake and unrelaxed, so they don’t really have a place in your wind-down time anyway. Dim the lights. A cool, dark bedroom makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Do something relaxing. Read a chill book. Take a luxurious bath. Do some breathing exercises. Whatever works for you. Sticking to this routine not only helps you get into a relaxed mood for sleeping, it also helps you stick to that sleep schedule you set in the first step. After all, you can't be halfway through a movie at 10 p.m. if you refrained from starting it at 9 p.m.Set your body clock during the daySleep and darkness aren't the only things that set your body's circadian rhythms. Daytime activities help to keep your internal clock on track, and these can help your overall health as well.Get plenty of sunlight in the morning. (In the winter, a light box may help.) Exercise during the day. You can combine this with sunlight by going for a morning or lunchtime walk. But any type of exercise will help you to sleep better. Eat meals earlier in the day. We sleep best when we eat during the daytime; if a nice early breakfast fits your schedule, consider making it a regular thing. But at the very least, don’t eat right before bed. Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the eveningsCaffeine keeps you up, and its effects linger longer than you may realize. Caffeine has a half-life of five hours, with some of us processing it a little faster or a little slower. To put this another way, If the average person has a 250-milligram cup of coffee at noon (such as a Starbucks Tall sized brewed coffee), they'll still have about 125 milligrams in their system at 5 p.m. and 63 milligrams at 10 p.m.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe speed with which we break down caffeine varies from person to person, but in general: It’s affecting you more than you realize. If you think of yourself as a person who “can have an energy drink and then fall right to sleep” you are probably (a) in denial—hey, you’re the one who clicked on an article about getting better sleep—and/or (b) you have built up a massive caffeine tolerance because you drink so much of the stuff to stay awake, which in turn is because you don’t get enough sleep so you’re tired all the time. Do yourself a favor and break the cycle. An easy way to back off is to give yourself a cutoff time. No caffeine after 5 p.m., let’s say. Once that’s part of your routine, walk it back to 2 p.m. or noon. Alcohol is another chemical that affects our sleep. A nightcap before bed may make you feel sleepy, but it tends to disrupt the quality of your sleep. If you aren’t convinced, just start keeping a sleep diary—on paper is fine if you don’t have a sleep-tracking gadget—and see if you don’t get more and better sleep on the nights you don’t drink.Make your bedroom a dark little caveA welcoming, cozy bed will help you get to sleep faster. Make it dark, with blackout curtains or an eye mask, if needed. Make it quiet, with a white noise machine or earplugs if you can’t completely silence your surroundings. And make it a comfortable temperature. Most people prefer a cool environment—usually around 66 degrees—but again, this varies from person to person.Comfortable sheets and pillows can help. If you’re always tossing and turning, try to figure out if there’s something that physically bothers you. A new mattress might not be in the budget, but a mattress topper or a different pillow is an easy fix.ExperimentWhile the tips here are the basic things you should at least try, you may not need every single aspect to be textbook. I freeze if my room is set to 66 degrees, for example, so I keep the thermostat a tick warmer and I make sure I always have a warm duvet, even in summertime. You may find that you can bend certain rules but not others. I always have a crappy night’s sleep if I’ve been drinking, but late meals don’t bother me much. Once you’re getting a solid night’s sleep on the regular, you can start playing with the routine. And if you’re doing everything you can for good sleep hygiene and you still feel tired all the time, consider seeking medical help in case you have sleep apnea or another condition that could be affecting your sleep or energy levels.\n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Beth Skwarecki\n                                    Senior Health Editor\n                                \n                                            Covering health, fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Beth's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Beth\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

I've written before about add-ons that manage to slip through official store safeguards and even some that \"wake up\" as malware after operating normally for several years, so it should come as no surprise that a host of AI-powered browser extensions—collectively  installed by tens of millions of users—may also be invading your privacy. Researchers at data removal service Incogni looked at browser extensions available in the Chrome Web Store that included \"AI\" in their name or description and employed AI as part of their core functionality. By analyzing the data collected and permissions required, they assessed both how likely extensions are to be used maliciously and their potential to cause significant damage if compromised.AI-powered browser extensions collect extensive user dataIncogni found that website content, such as text, images, sounds, videos, and hyperlinks, was the most commonly collected data type (by nearly a third of AI-powered extensions). More than 29% of extensions investigated harvest personally identifiable information (PII)—name, address, email, age, identification number, for example—from users. Other forms of data collected include user activity, authentication information, personal communication, location, financial and payment information, web history, and health information. \nThe most invasive extensions fall in the programming and mathematical aid category (such as Classology AI and StudyX), followed closely by meeting assistants and audio transcribers. Writing and personal assistants also pose privacy risks—and many of these are also among the most downloaded AI-powered extensions in Chrome. How popular AI-powered Chrome extensions stack up on privacyIncogni also assigned \"privacy-invasiveness\" scores to the most downloaded AI-powered extensions, a combination of the amount of data collected and both general and sensitive permissions required: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGrammarly: AI Writing Assistant and Grammar Checker App (tied for #1)Quillbot: AI Writing and Grammar Checker Tool (tied for #1)Sider: Chat wiht all AI (tied for #3)AI Grammar Checker & Paraphraser — LanguageTool (tied for #3)Google Translate (tied for #4)WPS PDF — Read, Edit, Fill, Convert, and AI Chat PDF with Ease (tied for #4)Monica: All-in-One AI Assist  (tied for #4)AI Chat for Google (tied for #4)Immersive Translate — Translate Web & PDFChatGPT searchGrammarly and Quillbot were found to collect PII and website content as well as location data like region, IP address, and GPS coordinates. Grammarly also harvest user activity through network monitoring, clicks, mouse and scroll positions, and keystroke logging. While both also require sensitive permissions—such as the ability to inject code into websites and access active browser tabs—they have a relatively low risk of being used maliciously. How to protect your personal informationBrowser extensions that use AI aren't inherently bad, but you should be aware of what information they are collecting and what permissions they are requiring. The most common type of sensitive permissions required are scripting, which allows the extension to interact with pages as you navigate online, as well as activeTab, which lets it read or modify the page for the current session. When adding an extension (or installing an app or program), carefully review the permissions requested. If they aren't essential to the extension's functionality–or if they are but don't seem justified—you may be putting your data or device at risk by allowing them. As Incogni points out, users have to decide how much privacy to sacrifice in order to use apps and services. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

But like any digital service, the data you provide when signing up is at the mercy of Substack, or anyone who happens to gain access to that data. Unfortunately, that's now the case. As reported by BleepingComputer, Substack recently disclosed a significant data breach. The company's CEO, Chris Best, sent users a notice of the breach this week, sharing that email addresses, phone numbers, and \"other internal metadata\" were shared from Substack accounts without their permission. The company reportedly discovered the breach on Feb. 3, even though hackers accessed the data itself in October of 2025. That means the data was in unauthorized hands for roughly four months before Substack identified the breach. Best explained that Substack has since fixed the problem with the system that allowed an unauthorized third party to access this data. The company is launching an investigation and is reportedly taking steps to prevent this type of breach from happening going forward. On the bright side, Best claims that credit card numbers, passwords, and financial information were not accessed in the breach. \nWhat Best doesn't share is the scope of the breach. For that, we have to turn to BleepingComputer, which found a post from a \"threat actor\" on the hacking forum BreachForums. The actor posted a database of 697,313 Substack records, sharing that the Substack user base is much larger, but the scraping method was \"noisy and patched fast.\" This actor says the data compromised includes email addresses, phone numbers, names, user IDs, Stripe IDs, profile pictures, and bios—a bit more detailed than the report from Substack's CEO.700,000 records isn't the same as 700,000 users: Each record is something like an email address or a phone number, which means one Substack user could have lost multiple records in the breach. Still, it's a large number of data points, and is little consolation to the users who have lost information here. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat Substack can do after this breachUnfortunately, there's not much users can do to mitigate a data breach once it's happened. The data stolen from Substack is already lost, and you won't be able to undo that. However, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself in the wake of the breach, and to prevent this data loss in the future. First, closely monitor your incoming texts and emails. Hackers will take advantage of the data here to target Substack users in phishing schemes. If you receive messages from strangers, or even suspicious messages claiming to come from Substack, exercise caution. As per usual, never click on links in messages from senders you don't know, and, even more importantly, never download files or applications if instructed. You may also want to consider masking your email address going forward. Use a service like Apple's \"Hide My Email\" or DuckDuckGo's email protection to generate a \"burner\" address each time you need to share your email with a service. The service will send messages to the burner address, which gets forwarded to your real address. That way, the service doesn't know your real address, and, if hacked, won't compromise it. Hackers will only get the burner, which you can shut down at any time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

When you select it, you'll see story cards you can swipe through that tell you more about the song you're listening to. Spotify says the stories are summarized from \"third-party sources,\" and in my testing, I've seen sources like Hypebeast, Wikipedia, and fan sites. The company also tells me that \"some systems\" of the feature use machine learning to generate these summaries, which means About the Song is, in part, AI-generated.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nAs with many of Spotify's new features, About the Song is only available for Premium subscribers. At this time, it's also limited to English accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. If you pay for Spotify in one of these regions, the feature is exceptionally easy to find. When you're listening to a song, just scroll down on the page until you see the \"About the Song\" card. If you don't see it, that song likely doesn't support the feature. Some songs will only have one summary card, but others may have more. If so, you'll see icons in the top right of the card window telling you which card you're reading. You can swipe left on the card to open the next. \nI've seen songs with as many as four of these cards, though it's possible some songs have even more. Some of those are all summarized from the same source—say, one Wikipedia article—while others pull from multiple sources to generate multiple About the Song cards. There are thumbs-up and thumbs-down options on each card to rate the summary, implying these are AI-generated. The summaries appear to be static once generated though—when I quit the app and return, the summaries are the same. I'd be curious to know if the summaries are the same for everyone who chooses a song, or if they're generated for each individual listener.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify has had a busy week. On Thursday, one day before announcing \"About the Song,\" the company revealed its plans to start selling physical paper books, which sync with its digital audiobooks. The day before that, Spotify revamped its lyrics feature, including the option to download lyrics for offline viewing. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This latest \"Patch Tuesday\" fixes 58 vulnerabilities in total, six of which are zero-day flaws. As a reminder, a zero-day is a vulnerability that has been either actively exploited in the wild or publicly disclosed before an official fix is released by the developer. As BleepingComputer reports, security flaws were found in the following categories: 25 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, five security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 12 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, six information disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial of service vulnerabilities, and seven spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities and two of the information disclosure vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" (These numbers do not include the three Microsoft Edge vulnerabilities patched earlier in February.)Patch Tuesday updates are typically released around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of every month, and your device should receive them automatically. BleepingComputer reports that this month's release also includes Secure Boot certificate updates for 2011 certificates that are expiring in June. \nSix zero-days patched in FebruaryThree of the six actively exploited zero-days fixed in February are security feature bypass vulnerabilities: CVE-2026-21510: This is a flaw the Windows Shell that allows an attacker to execute content without warning or gaining user consent, though the user does need to open a malicious link or shortcut file. CVE-2026-21513: This MSHTML Framework vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network. Microsoft has not released details on how this flaw was exploited. CVE-2026-21514: This vulnerability in Microsoft Word allows an attacker to bypasses OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office once a user has opened a malicious Office file. All three of the above flaws have been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), Office Product Group Security Team, and Google Threat Intelligence Group along with an anonymous researcher for CVE-2026-21510 and CVE-2026-21514.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo of the zero-days are elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. CVE-2026-21519 is a Desktop Windows Manager flaw that allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges, while CVE-2026-21533 is a Windows Remote Desktop Services flaw that allows an attacker to elevate privileges locally. The former has been attributed to MSTIC and MSRC, while the latter was discovered by the Advanced Research Team at CrowdStrike.Finally, CVE-2026-21525 is a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager that allows an unauthorized attacker to deny service locally. This flaw was discovered by the ACROS Security team with 0patch—it was reportedly found in a public malware repository in December 2025. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

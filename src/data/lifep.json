Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.</p>\n<p>If you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/422610/oura-ring-neurable-apple-airpods-brain-health\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>stop at headphones</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/what-is-wearable-neurotech-and-why-might-we-need-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>they aren’t the only company</u></a> making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. </p><h2 id=\"what-are-brain-wearables-in-theory\">What are brain wearables in theory?</h2><p>The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">electroencephalography</a> (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.</p><p>For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your <em>work</em>-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.</p><p>The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-science-of-brain-wearables-hold-up\">How does the science of brain wearables hold up?</h2><p>Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.neurotechlaw.com/jose-m-munoz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">José M. Muñoz</a>, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"</p><p>The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.</p><p>\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"</p><p>In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.</p><p><a href=\"https://annunavani.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dr. Annu Navani</a> offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Rather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-really-reading-your-mind-here\">Who is really reading your mind here?</h2><p>Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? </p><p>\"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says <a href=\"https://www.starkashman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Star Kashman</u></a>, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"</p><p>The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.</p><p>Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/technology/personaltech/meta-smart-glasses-mark-zuckerberg.html#:~:text=But%20our%2030%2Dminute%20test,Creative%20Strategies%2C%20a%20research%20firm.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Meta's push</a> for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. </p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>So, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. </p><p>I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.</p><p>For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.</p><p>Until then, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-fitness-trackers\" target=\"_blank\">your regular fitness tracker</a> measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBE4ASBWE2SZPMN349CSQ/image.fill.size_150x150.v1704303046.png\" alt=\"Meredith Dietz\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Meredith Dietz</p>\n                                    <p>Senior Staff Writer</p>\n                                <div>\n                                            <p>Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.</p>\n                                    </div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/meredithdietz\">Read Meredith's full bio</a></p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Meredith</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-run-coach-marathon-training-plans\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K779KY2A80E6ZBAA5VYE3K2K/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1760107820.png\" alt=\"Garmin watch training plan\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fitness-watches-under-200-dollars-october-prime-day-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K72SPXH2RS93BW9RXQGGN8DA/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759958378.png\" alt=\"three fitness watches in an illustrated shipping box\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>",

It warned a \"limited number of users\" who had communications with certain Discord teams were affected, though the \"unauthorized party\" did not gain access to any Discord networks directly. </p><p>In that initial announcement, Discord said a number of user data types might have been stolen. That included their names, usernames, email addresses, billing information, last four digits of credit cards, purchase histories, IP addresses, messages with Discord service agents, and \"limited corporate data,\" such as training materials and internal presentations. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>While all of this information is sensitive, it unfortunately isn't surprising to see as part of a breach like this. However, Discord also revealed that the hackers may have also gained access to a \"small number\" of government ID images, including driver's licenses and passports. As it turns out, that \"small number\" turned out to be 70,000. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/797051/discord-government-ids-leaked-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Discord confirmed as much</a> to The Verge on Wednesday. If you were among these affected users, Discord will have reached out to you via email.</p><h2 id=\"age-verification-is-a-privacy-nightmare\">Age verification is a privacy nightmare</h2><p>Why did a Discord affiliate even have these users' government IDs to begin with? Age verification. Like many other companies, Discord now restricts certain content to minors. If you are incorrectly identified as underage, <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041820932-Help-I-m-old-enough-to-use-Discord-in-my-country-but-I-got-locked-out\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you're allowed to appeal</a> and prove that you are at least 18 years old. To do so, you need to take a photo of yourself holding either a photo ID with your date of birth, or a piece of paper with your full Discord username. Discord outsources this work to a third-party, which hackers targeted in this data breach.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As 404 Media reports</a>, hackers suggest they've taken even more data than Discord has acknowledged. That includes data on whether users were verified or not; users' home towns, states or counties, and countries; info on whether they had multi-factor authentication turned on for their account; and the last time they were online on Discord.</p><p>This event demonstrates the risks of companies requiring users to verify their ages by uploading government IDs. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/texass-new-age-verification-law-has-serious-privacy-issues\" target=\"_blank\">Users in Texas</a> must verify their ages before they can download apps on their phones, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-watch-pornhub-even-if-its-blocked-in-your-state\" target=\"_blank\">a number of states require the same</a> before accessing adult websites. No matter where you live, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/youtube-is-using-ai-to-roll-out-new-protections-for-teens\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube will use AI to guess your age</a>, and, if it gets it wrong, you'll need to prove your age yourself. </p><p>The goal is to protect children and underage users from accessing content they shouldn't be seeing, but by doing it this way, companies are putting users at risk: They're asking you to trust them with your government IDs, credit cards, even selfies; or, if not them, a third-party affiliate. As we can see with this case, a lapse in security means tens of thousands of Discord users who were just trying to prove their age now have exposed government IDs. What happens when an entire state's population faces the same? Or a whole country's?  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

All of that is fine and well—though generally, following a Stack or personalized plan is better, since it reduces the time you spend deliberating and dilly-dallying and gives you a clear goal for the workout—but you have another option. In fact, depending on your goals, you have another potentially <em>superior</em> option in the form of a Peloton Program.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-peloton-program\">What is a Peloton Program?</h2><p>Program is the term Peloton uses for longer-term, guided training routines that are tailored to a specific goal. They can range from a few days long to weeks long, but the idea is that you'll finish the program and be more prepared to do whatever it was you were training for. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>When you log into the app on your mobile device or Peloton equipment, you'll see your personalized plan first, followed by a subheading that says <strong>Your Programs</strong>. There, any Programs you're currently participating in will be ready to go. You can just tap it to keep moving through it with whatever class or exercise is next up. To access Programs and see everything available, tap <strong>Classes</strong> in the bottom row of the mobile app, then <strong>Programs</strong> up at the top. (It's to the right of <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Gym</strong>, and <strong>Collections</strong>.)</p><p>Each program is designed by an instructor (or, sometimes, more than one instructor) and when you tap on it, you'll see information on how many classes are in it, how many days or weeks it lasts, and how long the classes are. You'll also see a summary of the Program and what it's designed for, as well as notes on which equipment, if any, is necessary for the classes. You can even see a week-by-week breakdown of what classes to expect. </p><p>These are self-paced, so you can take the classes or participate whenever you want, but you should try to do them in the timeframe laid out by the instructor. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-can-you-use-programs-for\">What can you use Programs for?</h2><p>This is the fun part. There are so many Programs and some of them are almost too specific to believe—but that's why they're useful. There's probably one in there that aligns with exactly what you're trying to do, whatever it is. A selection of titles:</p><ul><li><p>Strength for Soccer (one week, seven classes)</p></li><li><p>The Power of Sleep (two weeks, 15 classes)</p></li><li><p>Strength for Cyclists (one week, six classes)</p></li><li><p>Floor Bootcamp (four weeks, 24 classes)</p></li><li><p>Road to Half Marathon (10 weeks, 40 classes)</p></li><li><p>Strength for Tennis & Pickleball (one week, eight classes)</p></li><li><p>Strength for Skiers (one week, 11 classes)</p></li><li><p>You Can Run Outdoors (eight weeks, 16 classes)</p></li><li><p>Set the Barre (four weeks, 13 classes)</p></li><li><p>Path to Inversion (two weeks, 12 classes)</p></li></ul><p>There is \"density training,\" training for people who golf, and training for anyone looking to pull off a yoga inversion. Again, these are specific goals, but with strength, meditation, and other classes geared toward them, you can take a more well-rounded approach to meeting them. Programs are also classified as beginner, intermediate, or advanced, so you don't end up in over your head or bored. </p><p>One thing I like about them—besides that they help you create a goal-based workout plan and are so tailored to specific achievements—is that participating in them earns you extra points <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/club-peloton-ranking-system\" target=\"_blank\">toward your Club Peloton rank</a>. By moving up in Club Peloton, you can unlock discounts and early access to other classes, providing even more variety (and some smugness, if you're like me). </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

OpenAI's TikTok for AI slop. But putting my concerns aside for what appears to be a glorified <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-stop-deepfakes-on-sora\" target=\"_blank\">deepfake machine</a>, it's evident the app is popular. OpenAI says <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/openais-sora-downloads.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Sora hit one million downloads in under five days</a>, likely fueled by interest from users seeing hyper-realistic videos going viral on social media. </p><p>But with big hype, comes big risk for fraud. While OpenAI made Sora free to download, the app started out invite-only, which only built anticipation for users who wanted in. As such, those users might open the App Store, search for Sora, and download the first app that makes itself available—especially if they can start using it right away. That's exactly what happened in this case. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-copycats-flooded-apples-app-store-and-some-still-remain/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by TechCrunch</a>, over a dozen fake Sora apps were made available on the iOS App Store following the launch of OpenAI's real app. These apps were either called \"Sora\" or \"Sora 2,\" the latter in reference to the specific video model powering these hyper-realistic AI generations.</p><p>You might assume developers hastily uploaded these apps to the App Store in an attempt to pull traffic from users curious about Sora. And while that is true, a number of these apps were already live on the App Store long before OpenAI ever announced the Sora app—some of which were operating under different names. It's not clear how many changed their names in this situation, but it's apparent that many did adjust their names shortly after Sora launched. TechCrunch says some apps had been available on the App Store since earlier this year, while others were available since last year.  </p><p>Apple's App Store isn't the only affected app market here. Google's Play Store played host to fraudulent Sora apps, as well. Taken together, these apps were downloaded more than 300,000 times, with more than 80,000 of those occurring after Sora's official launch. Perhaps the most successful fake Sora app, \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator,\" pulled in over 50,000 downloads alone once OpenAI released Sora. TechCrunch reports that these apps collectively earned over $160,000, all from apps claiming to be something else entirely. </p><p>At this time, most, but not all, of these apps have been pulled from app stores.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-spot-fake-apps-on-your-app-store\">How to spot fake apps on your app store</h2><p>First of all, if the app you're trying to download is trendy and popular, like Sora, assume there will be developers trying to spoof it. Malicious developers want to trick users looking for one app into downloading theirs, whether it's to install malware on your device, steal your information, or make money off you by running ads. If they know a million people are going to be downloading an app, hosting a fraudulent one makes for good business.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>When looking through the app store's results page, pay close attention to the name of the app. Sure, it might have \"Sora\" in the title, but does it have any odd, extraneous words added in? \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator\" isn't the worst fake name I've ever seen, but the app's name is Sora, not Sora 2. OpenAI also likely wouldn't add AI Video Generator to its own product's name: They probably know the product speaks for itself, and wouldn't feel the need to clutter up the name with extra details. Instead, the real title is \"Sora by OpenAI,\" likely done to both distinguish itself from legitimate apps named Sora, as well as indicate that it is indeed made by OpenAI.</p><p>Speaking of which, you should always make sure the app in question is distributed by the company that made it. If you're trying to figure out which of the Sora apps on your app store is the real one, it's going to be the one that says it's made by OpenAI. I'm not talking about the title alone, either. Tap on the app, and look at the developer name underneath the title. If it doesn't match the exact company you know develops the app, don't download it.</p><p>You'll also want to investigate the copy and images advertising the app here. Is everything written well, and free of spelling and grammar mistakes? Are the images high quality, and reflect the experience the app it advertising? Don't download something that feels slapped together: Some fraudsters don't bother with the finer details.  </p><p>Finally, make sure the app in question is actually available on the platform you're using. Sora is currently iOS-only, which means any app claiming to be Sora by OpenAI on the Play Store is a fraud. If you're on Android, you'll simply need to wait for OpenAI to make the app for your platform. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

A great example of this: the Von Restorff effect, which refers to our brains’ acuity for remembering distinctive pieces of information over more uniform ones, a fact discovered by a German psychiatrist named Hedwig von Restorff. It’s an interesting fact of biology, but it can also be very useful to know when you’re studying a difficult concept. Here’s why, and how to put the Von Restorff effect to good use.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-von-restorff-effect\">What is the Von Restorff effect?</h2><p>In previous articles, I’ve discussed various memory effects you can capitalize on when you study, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-primacy-effect-can-help-you-remember-informat-1850432109\" target=\"_blank\">primacy effect</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-proust-effect-can-help-you-study-1850749025\" target=\"_blank\">Proust effect</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-production-effect-to-study-more-effectively-1850915123\" target=\"_blank\">production effect</a>. All of these begin with a nice, a round-looking “P\" and the consonant blend of \"Pr-.\" If I add the Von Restorff effect to that list, it will stand out solely because of the variety in its name—the rigid angle of that “V\" and the hard sound of the Restorff. Because of this, you’re more likely to remember the Von Restorff effect when asked to name the four memory phenomena we just went over—and <em>that’s </em>the Von Restorff effect in action.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the simplest terms, it is an “isolation effect” that ensures your brain will remember an item in a list if it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other entries on the list. When studying, you can achieve this effect by changing the meaningfulness of an item or a piece of information in some way, whether by color, size, font choice, or another approach.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-von-restorff-effect-to-remember-what-you-study\">How to use the Von Restorff effect to remember what you study</h2><p>The good news is that, unlike when you try to harness the power of other memory-based study techniques, this one is pretty straightforward. It's almost too simple, which is why you might not be familiar with it or ever have considered finding ways to use it. Once you realize the simplicity of this concept, it’s easy to find ways to work it into your study habits. </p><ul><li><p>In your notes, use a highlighter specifically to highlight words or concepts you need to remember for a test. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">Color-coding your notes</a> is a supremely helpful studying technique on its own because even taking the time to choose the colors and their meanings helps you focus. </p></li><li><p>When using flashcards, write concepts and words you’re having a hard time grasping in a different color. If you're using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner method</a> (which you should be), you can rewrite or recreate cards every time you drill them. With that technique, you move your cards into piles every time you get them right or wrong, then study the piles at different frequencies, focusing on ones you know less often than ones that are giving you trouble. Every few times you move a card up or down into a pile, try rewriting or recreating it with a different text color. If a card is red but your color for easy ones is blue, you'll be instantly reminded that this is one you recently struggled with, which can help you lock in and pull the information from your memory using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">active recall</a>. </p></li><li><p>When studying with others and talking through the material (or reading aloud from your notes), try associating a unique motion—like a specific hand gesture—with the concepts you’re discussing. </p></li><li><p>Use a shape, like a circle or box, to outline key parts of your notes or textbook materials. Do this when you're mind-mapping, especially, so all your mind maps are uniform. Dates can be in squares, vocab words in circles, and so on. To make quick and efficient mind maps, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">an app like Xmind</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">mind-mapping</a>, move the circle containing the most important concepts (or the one you’re struggling to grasp) to a more removed part of your page, differentiating it from the rest of the clusters visually. I do a version of this with my to-do list, which is written on a whiteboard on the fridge. Unusual things, like a doctor's visit or something I need to buy but don't usually get on my weekly trip to the grocery store, get written off to the side. They're more notable that way, drawing my attention away from the larger block of text and reminding me, over and over, that I have to do them. By the time doctor's appointment day rolls around or I'm in the store trying to remember my list, those are seared into my brain. </p></li><li><p>If you're revising your notes, use different text styles. This is something I did all the time in college, even when taking notes in class. I would bold anything a professor led into by announcing, \"This will be on the test.\" I would turn vocab words purple. Even if you're hand-writing (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">which you should be!</a>), you can draw squiggly underlines under certain ideas, circle others ... you get the point. Get zany with it, but keep it uniform. If you draw a big box around one date, do it to all of them. If you draw arrows pointing to a state law and a circle around a federal one, do it to all of them. </p></li></ul><p>The goal is to differentiate the things you need or struggle to remember using color, motion, shape, or even orientation. Setting certain ideas or words apart will make them stick in your brain better, no matter how you do it. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

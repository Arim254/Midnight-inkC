Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.And then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Naturally, scammers are using this model to collect your personal data and promising huge rewards that never materialize. According to a report from Malwarebytes Labs, bad actors are luring users into taking surveys through malvertising ads claiming you've won a Walmart voucher for hundreds of dollars. All you have to do is answer a few questions—easy enough—but you're actually handing over information that can be used to target you even further. Surveys promising big rewards are a scamThese scams start with malvertising (malicious advertising) like website pop-ups and banners, spam emails, and social media ads stating that you've been selected to receive a \"free\" gift card worth hundreds of dollars. The fake ads use official logos from recognizable brands, which build trust, along with countdown timers, which promote urgency. You may think you've gotten lucky, and all you have to do is take a short survey to earn a big payout. When you click through, though, you're redirected to a fake rewards page, which may also look credible thanks to stolen branding. You'll be prompted to provide personal information, such as your name, phone number, email, and address, as well as indicate interest in topics like home repair and insurance. You may be redirected again based on your answers—to a spoofed home improvement site for FindMyWindowPro or Renewal By Anderson, for example—where you're prompted to provide even more data. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis endless loop of surveys doesn't end with a gift card payout, and along the way, you've handed scammers a lot of information that can be sold and used to target you with much more personalized scams in the future based on interests you've handed them. Survey scams may seem like simply a waste of time rather than a real threat, since you don't lose any money right away. But you may see more spam calls and believable phishing emails as a result. Avoid fake survey scamsLike all scams, this one plays on emotion: notably, the excitement of getting lucky and winning big. You're lured in with a sense of urgency and the illusion of low effort. Scammers also use real branding to make the scheme seem more credible. As always, these elements should raise suspicion. Retailers are almost never offering promotions that are too good to be true, and you should never provide personal information in exchange for a \"free\" prize. If you do click through one of these ads, look carefully at the URL, which is almost certainly not the retailer's official domain. How to actually get paid for taking surveysYou can get paid to take surveys or test apps and games, though you certainly won't earn the hundreds of dollars promised in survey scams. The pay is low for the time invested (in most cases, a few dollars per hour) and some survey platforms require you to hit a minimum amount earned to request a payout. You typically have to engage consistently and across multiple platforms to make it worthwhile. NerdWallet compiled a list of popular survey-for-money apps, including Make Money, Eureka, InboxDollars Surveys, Google Opinion Rewards, and Swagbucks. Reddit users also suggest Survey Junkie and Branded Surveys. Prolific is a relatively high-paying platform, though you have to join a waitlist to gain access. Of course, you should know that even legitimate survey sites collect a lot of personal information, such as your birth date, zip code, phone number, and health history. All of this may be sold to data brokers, and there's always a risk of a data breach that could lead to identity theft. Be sure to weigh the risks and rewards of signing up for these platforms. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Before the likes of TikTok and Instagram Reels, online video content was more long-form than not. It might have felt short by the standards of cable TV, but many of the videos  on platforms like YouTube were regularly anywhere from two to 10 minutes, if not longer. The first platform to really popularize short-form content as we think of it now was Vine. These videos were short—a maximum of six seconds at a time, which should have spelled the platform's doom. Who would want to watch these tiny videos back to back for hours at a time? A lot of us, apparently. Vine compilations garner millions (if not tens of millions) of views on YouTube. While the Twitter-owned platform only lasted about five years, it established itself as a true cultural phenomenon. Quote the first half of a popular vine to a group of young millennials or Gen Zs, and, chances are, they'll finish the line. For years, us Vine fans have longed for someone to bring the app back. Sure, short-form video has never been more addicting, but it's just not the same. Videos on Vine had a much different feel than most of the content you see on TikTok. Maybe it was the limited runtime; maybe it was the stripped-down recording interface. But to me, Vine feels like early YouTube: homemade, indie, and fun.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDivine is the new VineIt seems that experience might actually be making a comeback. A new app, Divine, is trying to recreate the magic of those six-second loops. Divine, built by former Twitter employee Evan Henshaw-Plath and funded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is meant to be a platform to share vines old and new. Of course, you can upload fresh six-second clips, but the app will also feature 150,000 to 200,000 \"archived\" vines from roughly 60,000 creators. You won't have to rely on those Vine compilations anymore—you can watch those classic clips directly on Divine. Those videos aren't scraped from YouTube compilations, either. According to TechCrunch, Vine's original library was stored by the organization \"Archive Team\" in a huge but largely inaccessible archive. Henshaw-Plath studied the library, extracting as much data as possible to build profiles for the original Vine accounts and display metrics like views and original comments. Though not all Vines were archived, including \"millions of K-pop-focused videos,\" Henshaw-Plath believes \"a good percentage\" are available on Divine. Vine creators can choose to either take down their videos from Divine or take over their profiles on the app, so long as they prove their identities. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDivine is also a decentralized social media platform running on the Nostr protocol. That means no one company owns it, which means your content is your content. When you post, your videos are tied to you via private keys, so you can always prove ownership. Plus, there are no user-specific algorithms. You have to choose what you want to watch, or jump into an algorithm created by the Divine community. My favorite part of this experiment, however? No AI. At a time when  other social media platforms are inundated with hyperrealistic videos from generators like Sora, Divine has a strict no-AI policy. Divine uses tech from the Guardian Project to confirm whether a video was filmed on a smartphone. If the system detects a video is artificial, it gets taken down. It's enough to make this tech editor shed a (joyful) tear. How to join DivineAs you might expect, there's a lot of demand to try Divine at launch. At this time, the company says its beta test is full. However, you can sign up for the waitlist to be notified when more spots open up. You can also browse clips on the platform's web app right now, even without an account, but I've found it to be a bit glitchy.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple brought RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging to the iPhone with iOS 18 last year, giving green-bubble users access to more features and functions. But what exactly is possible with RCS on the iPhone, and what is still exclusive to iMessage users? Are Android RCS users now fully integrated into chats in the iOS Messages app or not?I'll lay out exactly what you can do in RCS chats between iPhones and Android phones, and explain which features are still missing—and when you might be able to get them.  If you've got contacts on other mobile platforms, this should help you understand more about what the experience is like from their end.To use RCS, you must have a carrier that supports it (most now do). On an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging to enable it. In Google Messages on Android, tap your profile picture (top right), then choose Messages settings and RCS chats to turn on the feature.\nRCS on iOS and Android: what you can do Ever since iOS 18, RCS messaging has officially been supported in the iOS Messages app—specifically, via the RCS Universal Profile 2.4. This brings green bubble Android users closer to parity with iMessage users, though some features only work in one direction, and some features only work in one-to-one conversations and not group chats.One notable upgrade is support for high-resolution photos and videos, which should work seamlessly across all your RCS-enabled conversations, with no more issues around compression or transfer. Web links look better as well, because you'll get a proper preview shown on both Android and iOS, and you can share current locations too (though only as a static pin, not a live and updating one).\n    \n            \n            Web links now look much better between iOS and Android.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTyping indicators and read receipts are supported in both directions, assuming you've got them enabled on your devices. However, they don't work in group chats—RCS users on Android can now join group chats, but the experience can be buggy based on reports, and you lose the typing indicators and the read receipts.Emoji reactions are now supported, up to a point—but based on my testing, these only work from iPhone to Android. If you try and send an emoji reaction in the other direction, iPhone users will just get a separate text showing the emoji (it won't appear as a bubble on top of the original message).RCS on iOS and Android: what you can't do (yet)If you look at everything you can do in iMessage (with other iMessage users) and Google Messages (with other Android RCS users), you'll realize there's a long way to go when it comes to cross-platform support. For example, at the moment you can't unsend messages, or reply inline in a thread, either from Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android.You can edit messages, but only if you're an Android user messaging an iPhone user—and with the caveat that the iPhone user gets two texts (the original message and the edited message, which rather defeats the point). The ability to edit messages on an iPhone simply doesn't appear in an RCS conversation.\n    \n            \n            Message editing is something that doesn't quite work yet.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAnother missing feature is end-to-end encryption for your chats and files shared in them. Apple has promised that support for this in RCS conversations is on the way, though it hasn't shown up yet—not even in iOS 26. This should give you pause when it comes to sharing sensitive information in these chats.Full end-to-end encryption is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which Google is testing in beta and which Apple has yet to adopt. Once this next update finally makes its way to iPhones and Android devices, interoperability will be leveled up again—it should, in theory, bring with it full support for message editing, emoji reactions, and inline replies. Until then, it's something of a half-baked implementation, especially for group chats.\n            ",

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But even when you know what tasks need to be done, you still need to figure out how to prioritize them, so you can tackle them in the right order while giving each the amount of attention and resources they actually need. Here's where you can use the 3-3-3 method.What is the 3-3-3 method?This technique comes from Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals. He advocates planning each workday around a 3-3-3 model:First devote three hours to deep work on your most important project. Next, complete three other urgent tasks that don’t require three hours of focus. Finally, do three “maintenance” tasks, like cleaning, answering emails, or scheduling other work. Other productivity techniques, like the pomodoro method, call for you to engage in deep work, or completely uninterrupted work with no distractions, so consider tapping into one of those first three hours if you want to make the most of a 3-3-3 approach.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo figure out which of the above categories a task fits into, I recommend a prioritization method like the Eisenhower matrix, which involves using a quadrant system to divvy up your responsibilities by urgency and importance. You'll want to consider not only how timely the things you need to do are, but also how many resources they'll consume. Remember not to overestimate the amount of time your tasks will take you—the longer you give yourself to work on something, the more you'll naturally drag out your work, which hampers productivity. Be firm with yourself when deciding how long to allot for a major, resource-heavy task.If you don't consider yourself a morning person and aren't sure you can jump into a heavy workload right away in the day, it's not necessarily a problem. I've written about the value of eating the frog—or, rather, tackling your biggest task of the day right away when you get up, which is a part of the traditional 3-3-3 structure—and though I've tried it myself, I'm just not that kind of person. It doesn't mean I can't work within a 3-3-3 framework, so don't feel like you can't, either. Play around with the technique, maybe by starting later in the morning and pushing your lunch back. I find this approach helpful because, truthfully, I really only buckle down around 10:30 every day. Because I am a slower person in the morning, I rearrange my 3-3-3s, tackling maintenance tasks earlier in the day, which keeps me feeling motivated and productive—getting things like answering emails out of the way clears my mind so I can focus on my bigger tasks more easily later.The key to succeeding with a technique like this isn't forcing yourself to fit a mold, but molding the method to your own best working habits, giving yourself a little extra structure, within reason. The goal here is to be discerning about what you take on in a day and work in the right order to maximize productivity, but you have a little wiggle room, so try a few approaches to your schedule to see what works.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy the 3-3-3 method worksWhat distinguishes this method from other productivity hacks are those three hours of deep work. Usually, jumping into them first means you’ll be fresh, focused, and more likely to be able to focus on a task without getting distracted. Regardless of if you stick to the traditional structure of doing three hours of deep work first in your day or mess with the 3-3-3 schedule, make sure to keep those three hours free of emails, texts, chit-chat, or other menial duties, to the best of your ability. Deep work yields major productivity, so you’ll get a lot accomplished if you commit to it, but you can’t stay in that mindset forever. You’ll top out after about three hours, so it’s best to have those three other, smaller tasks lined up and ready to go so you can stay productive even while downshifting into less demanding responsibilities. After three hours in the zone, you should find that those tasks are easier.Finally, your maintenance tasks give you a chance to get things done while giving your brain a rest. Use your maintenance time to prepare for the following day’s work, put finishing touches on whatever you were working on during those three hours of intense focus, or, like me, get the most boring things over with so you can think about something else.You can use this technique to tackle seven different tasks of varying urgency levels or to break one major project down into smaller chunks, depending on what your day needs.

Take satellite connectivity for example: For most of the time cellphones and smartphones have existed, losing cell signal meant your mobile device was largely useless. With satellite connectivity, however, as long as you're within range of a satellite, you can continue to make calls and send texts. It's remarkable, for both the convenience of communication, as well as your safety. Right now, there are only a few companies leading the satellite connectivity charge, at least as far as consumer technology goes. T-Mobile is the only carrier pushing it, having partnered with Starlink to offer satellite communications to its customers. But you don't need T-Mobile for satellite connectivity if you have an iPhone: Since 2022, Apple has been building the iPhone's ability to connect to satellites, starting with Emergency SOS via Satellite (the ability to reach out to emergency services over satellite), before rolling out general satellite messaging with iOS 18. Whether you have T-Mobile, an iPhone, or both, it's possible to send your friend a text in the middle of nowhere, assuming you have a clear line of site to a satellite overhead. Amazing. And according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has some major plans to expand the iPhone's satellite connectivity capabilities.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\"Natural usage\" improvementsPerhaps most importantly, Apple wants you to be able to connect to satellites without the need for an unobstructed view of the sky. Right now, that's arguably one of the technology's biggest hurdles: It's great when you have a clear path between your iPhone and a satellite, but if there's something in the way—say, a bunch of trees, or if you're inside a building—the signal might not reach. The company is working on what is called \"natural usage\" improvements, which would support satellite connectivity across a wider variety of situations. Maybe your iPhone is in your pocket, or you're in your car, but it's as if you're outside in a wide open clearing. Apple Maps via satelliteOnce you're able to connect to satellites in more places, the other new features become even more useful. That includes a new version of Apple Maps that supports satellites, which would let you use the app without needing wifi or cellular. This is probably the feature I'd be most be excited for: It can be so stressful trying to pull up directions in an area with low to no signal, so to know you almost always have a way to connect Maps—even if it's slower than usual—would be a relief. Sending photos via satelliteMessaging is another area that will reportedly see some improvement: While you can currently text over cellular, Gurman says Apple is working on supporting sending photos over satellite as well.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThird-party supportIt won't just be Apple's own apps and services that are benefitting, either. Gurman says Apple is working on an API to let third-party developers add satellite support to their apps as well. Apple's own software may have the best experience, but it does open the door for expanded support. Other navigation apps, like Google Maps, could potentially connect to satellite this way. If you prefer it over Apple Maps, you wouldn't have to stick with your iPhone's built-in maps app when you don't have cell service. More coverage for future iPhonesWhile it wouldn't impact current iPhone owners, the iPhone 18 will likely support 5G NTN, which lets cell towers themselves connect to satellites to boost coverage.   When these features will launchApple can't add all of these improvements on their own, unfortunately. According to Gurman, the company will need Globalstar, the company that builds this satellite infrastructure, to make hardware improvements on their end. Assuming that happens, the idea of \"dead zones\" may be a relic of the first quarter of the 21st century.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You won't get access to the Phone app's latest AI features, but if all you want is a reliable way to record phone calls, you'll be set. Google announced this new rollout back in September, calling the ability to record calls a \"fundamentally useful feature,\" even without transcription or automatic note taking. That's certainly true: While the idea of recording phone calls might strike some as nefarious, there are many legitimate applications for recording phone calls, from journalists seeking a record of an phone interview, to patients calling their healthcare providers to make sure they keep track of all medical advice and instruction. Call recording on Android—especially on Google's Pixel devices—has had a turbulent past. While there was once a time you could download a third-party call recorder app without issue, Google started slowly taking away key functions from developers, like blocking access to recordings from microphones. In 2022, the company announced that was blocking access to Android's Accessibility API, the main workaround developers used for their apps—effectively killing the third-party call recorder market. If your phone's manufacturer supported call recording in their primary app, that was still OK, but if not, you basically lost this functionality. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, Google offers a feature called Call Notes, which transcribes and summarizes your calls using Gemini. In addition to these AI enhancements, however, you still receive a recording of the phone call, making these two Pixel series the only ones with the capability. That's why this call recording expansion is so necessary.Call recording on Pixel isn't perfectThere are two key caveats to keep in mind with this feature, however. First, don't expect to record a call without the other party's permission. Even if you live in a region with one-party consent—meaning you don't need both parties to agree to the recording—Google's call recorder will announce that it is about to record the call. Unless the other party isn't paying attention, they will know you're recording—and could choose to hang up the line if they feel uncomfortable. Second, this feature won't be available to all Pixel users, even if you have the proper Pixel device. This feature will only work in regions where call recording is legal, and Google says it is rolling out the functionality to all countries that support it throughout the rest of this year. It seems as of this article, the United States and Canada have the feature, but many other countries do not. If you live somewhere where call recording is legal, but don't see this feature yet, sit tight: It's likely rolling out soon. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up call recording on PixelTo start, make sure you're using a Pixel 6 or newer, running at least Android 14, or a non-Pixel device running at least Android 9. Next, update your Phone app to the latest version.Now, open the Phone app's Settings, then head to Call Assist > Call Recording. Here, you can turn on the toggle next to \"Turn on Call Recording.\" You can also toggle on \"Automatically record calls with non-contacts,\" if you want the app to start recording whenever someone outside your contacts list calls, or \"Automatically record calls with these numbers\" to manually select contacts you'd like the Phone app to record conversations for. You can choose to automatically delete these recordings after seven, 14, or 30 days, or let them stay on your phone forever. You can skip those latter two options, however, if you'd rather make recordings a case-by-case basis. If so, whenever you're in a call, you can choose the Call Assist button to select \"Call Recording.\" (If this is your first recording, you'll need to download some audio files before you're able to record calls.) When you do, the Phone app will ask if you'd like to record the call, which you can agree to. There is then a short countdown before the system alerts everyone on the call that it will begin recording. You can stop the recording at any time from the Call Assist menu. You'll find your new recording in the Home tab.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

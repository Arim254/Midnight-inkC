    "body": "\n        \n        I've said it before and I'll say it again: Safari is better than Chrome. Apple's default browser runs faster, is less cluttered, offers privacy features Google would never contemplate, and doesn't try to cram AI down your throat.But that doesn't mean Safari is perfect. Like all browsers, it works better if you install the right extensions. Here are a few I've found in the past year or so that make the best browser even better.Block ads and other clutter\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe internet is increasingly useless without a good ad blocker, and the best ad blocker for Safari—which works on both macOS and mobile devices—is wBlock. This extension uses the built-in ad blocking functionality offered by Safari, which is much faster than the workarounds that extensions on browsers like Chrome need to use. It also supports a number of popular blocklists, with automatic updating. Or you can go even further and install Userscripts. Best of all, it's completely free. Try it out if you're not happy with your current ad blocker.\nAdd a dark mode to sites that don't have one\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWe can argue endlessly about whether dark or light mode are better (and I have), but we can all agree it's annoying to be using dark mode only for the websites you're browsing to be white as snow. That's where Noir comes in. This extension forces Dark Mode in Safari on websites that otherwise don't offer the feature. It's a must-have for dark mode enthusiasts.Automatically open picture in picture when you switch tabsSafari, on mobile, will keep playing videos using picture-in-picture mode if you switch to another application or tab. The desktop version of Safari doesn't do this, which is a shame. Autopip is a Safari extension for Mac that adds this feature. The result: you can keep watching a video in the background while you're working in another tab or application. It's perfect if you're the sort of person who leaves a video playing while you're working on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nQuickly copy the URL for the current site\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nArc, the browser, is dead, and if I'm honest I only miss one feature: the ability to copy the URL of the current website using the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-C. Yes, it's a very specific thing to miss, but I can't overstate how much of a habit this became for me. And I can keep the habit thanks to Supercopy, a Safari extension that adds the keyboard shortcut to Safari. Yes: that's all it does. I use it dozens of times every day, though, so for me it's well worth keeping around.Filter Reddit to be less rage inducing\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'd love it if I spent less time on Reddit and I'm sure I'm not alone. The problem: there's a mix of useful and rage-inducing stuff on that website. The good news is Protego lets you filter Reddit to be less infuriating. The idea is to pick a few subreddits you know, in your heart of hearts, you shouldn't be looking at. Do that and you'll be able to use Reddit without ending up down rabbit holes of rage and disgust. You can also filter out posts using keywords and hide promoted content. Trust me: you'll be happier.\n            ",

While plenty of Christmas traditions have entered the dustbin of history, the mighty Christmas tree has survived the years; about 25-30 million real trees are purchased each year. Unless you have zero plans to celebrate the holiday, chances are you’re one of those people.If you think finding a Christmas tree is just a matter of heading to the empty lot or the tree farm down the road and grabbing one that looks vaguely tree-shaped, you would be wrong. If you want the best possible Christmas tree experience, you have to take a few basic aspects of the tree and your home into consideration. Here’s how to make sure you find the best Christmas tree.Your first stop toward the best possible Christmas tree is deciding where to set it up. You’ll want to choose a location where the tree will be the centerpiece of your celebration, and people can actually enjoy it, whether that’s in the living room, one corner of your tiny studio, or in the special Holiday Room you had built into the West Wing of the family manse. Once you’ve picked the right general location, you’ll want to avoid putting the tree next to a heat source (which will dry it out), and you’ll want it to be near a power outlet (so you don’t have extension cords tripping people up and/or possibly burning your house down).\nOnce you’ve selected the right spot, you’re going to want to measure. First, measure the height of your ceilings. Take off a foot to accommodate a stand and a topper, if you’re using one, and that’s the maximum height of tree you’re looking for. Measure from the center of the spot where the tree will stand and get an approximate circumference that will ensure branches don’t scratch the walls or block foot traffic, as well. Now you have the basic dimensions of the best tree for your space. Don’t forget to bring the tape measure to the tree lot.How to pick the best type of Christmas treeAlthough the Christmas tree has become a generic symbol of the holiday season, there are a surprising number of varieties. Choosing the best one depends on the look and feel you need:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTraditional. If you want that “Christmas card” look, go with a Balsam fir. These trees tend to have the classic triangular shape and deep green color you’re looking for, and they tend to last a long time indoors—this is kind of the default Christmas tree, and it will fill your house with that classic Christmas tree smell. If you want something a little different but still classic, the Fraser fir has more of a blue tint to it, and will last a long time.Kid-friendly. If you have little ones racing about, the stiff, surprisingly sharp needles of some trees might be a concern. The Douglas fir has a classic look but sports soft, bendy needles that won’t poke little eyes, as does the Scotch (or Scots) pine tree.Big room. If you’re putting the tree someplace that could reasonably described as a “Great Room” or similarly large space, you’ll want a tall, full-bodied tree like the Douglas fir to fill the space. You could also go with the majestic Norway spruce (the tree traditionally chosen to stand at Rockefeller Center in New York City), but beware: The Norway is a delicate tree that won’t last very long in your house.Minimalist. If your idea of decorating a home and tree for the holidays is to place a few subtle items around that hint at Christmas, the Grand fir makes a statement with its exceptionally long needles, and does well with just a touch of decoration. Another great choice is the Noble fir, which adds cones to the mix, giving it a ready-made decoration.Modern. If you’re going for a less-classic look, an Arizona cypress tree is a good choice. It’s generally a pale green with reddish-brown branches, resulting in a lush color story that’s still in the traditional realm while adding a touch of drama that other trees won’t have.Inspect the treeOnce you know which tree you want and where it’s going to go, give it a solid inspection to make sure you’re getting the best possible specimen. That means checking for insects and even animals or birds, making sure the needles feel fresh and don’t fall off easily, and actually smelling the tree—it should have a light, fresh scent, not a musty or moldy smell.Now you have the best possible Christmas tree, and all you have to do is take care of it properly so it lasts the whole holiday season.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

There’s no pressure. You get to enjoy all the brightly colored lights your neighbors put up, but you don’t have to put up your own. You don’t have to do any duty-shopping. But Christmas Day itself leaves you in a mostly shuttered world that feels like there’s nothing to do. Fortunately, there are still quite a few options to make Dec. 25 a fun day off, regardless of your observances.Un-Christmas classics: Chinese restaurants and moviesYou can’t go wrong with some moo shu pork and a trip to the multiplex. Chinese restaurants and movie theaters traditionally stay open on Christmas day for those who don't celebrate, and they’re often crowded with fellow Christmas refugees. Check Google for the hours of your local Chinese restaurant and give them a call to make a reservation. If you’re more adventurous and you’re in a city large enough to have a Chinatown (or a whatever-town), just head straight there on Christmas and see what happens—that’s how the best days usually start.If Chinese food isn’t your thing, look at restaurants serving any non-European cuisine—Greek places, Japanese places, and Mediterranean places are usually open, as are plenty of Italian restaurants and steakhouses. Just make sure you check first. Lots of chain restaurants are open on Christmas Day, including Applebees, McDonald’s, Benihana, and more. You can even get Christmas breakfast at your local IHOP. But not every location of every outlet follows the same hours, so check first. \nAs for movies, most chain multiplex theaters are open on Dec. 25, and theaters are usually pretty full. The movies attract both people who don't celebrate Christmas and people who celebrate the holiday but want to get away from their families for a couple hours, so make sure and reserve a seat beforehand. Consider hitting up an out-of-the-way spot or that theater with the table service and cushy recliners to make it feel like more of an occasion.Most people going to the movies on Christmas Day aren’t there for Christmas movies, so interesting “secular” movies are often slated for release on the 25th. This year, a ridiculous looking re-boot of Anaconda starring Jack Black will be released on Christmas, so you've got options.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLess obvious options for Christmas day funChinese restaurants and movie theaters aren’t the only establishments open on Christmas. Here are some other options:Go skiing or snowboarding: Most mountains are open on Christmas and the lift lines are blissfully empty. There's no better way of celebrating a winter-based holiday than on a wide open mountain.Visit a skating rink: Speaking of winter sports, ice skating rinks are generally open on Christmas too. Pretend to be a tourist: Tourist attractions are often open on Christmas, especially in larger cities. This includes places like Madame Tussaud’s and Ripley’s Believe It or Not, as well as ziplines and Segway tours—so do that touristy thing you’ve never done before.Get a room: If you’ve got some spare cash and have nothing better to do, get a room at a hotel. Hotels don’t usually close on Christmas, and they typically offer plenty of amenities, so take advantage of the pool at the Holiday Inn or the spa at the Four Seasons, depending on your lifestyle. Hiking and biking: Hiking trails and parks are open on Christmas if you want to get outdoors. If you’re into biking, hit the trails or hit the streets: Traffic is minimal on Christmas, so it’s a great time to put in some serious roadwork. Volunteer: Not having anything to do on Christmas isn’t the biggest life problem, especially compared to people who have nowhere to go and nothing to eat. So use Christmas to help people and actually deliver on that whole “good will towards men” thing. Check your local Craigslist for volunteering opportunities.  Use Christmas as a catch-up day: This is strictly for type-A people, but if everyone is out of town and no one is going to call you, why not spend the day catching up on neglected chores or personal projects? You can spend at least part of your day knocking a few things off your to-do list and the rest of the time relaxing. That way you’ll get a break and still feel accomplished.Just sleep all day: Type-B personalities like me see a day free of obligations and other people as a golden opportunity to do as little as is humanly possible, a day to fully commit to sloth. Spend time with friends and family at home: Not celebrating Christmas doesn’t mean you can’t spend the day with family and/or friends. Get together with your loved ones, play games, watch a movie, cook together, talk, or whatever else you all enjoy. You don’t have to go out to have fun, so don’t rule out staying in with people you care about.Shopping: This is at the bottom of the list because it’s iffy. Drug stores and convenience stores like 711 are usually open on the 25th. Grocery chains like Kroger’s and Trader Joe’s usually aren’t. Your local shopping mall or retail district might be open, but probably won't be, so check ahead. Make a list and check it twiceBecause so many places are closed on Christmas day, you should plan ahead (unless you like spontaneity and are OK with the possibility of disappointment) by:Making a list of the places you want to go.Calling nearby locations to confirm they’ll be open, as not every chain follows corporate holiday hour recommendations. Making reservations at any restaurant(s) you plan to visit.Putting together a basic timeline of the day, accounting for travel time, so you don’t lose any reservations, miss a movie, or arrive after the store closes.The most important advice here is to do something intentional on Christmas, even if it's sleeping in, so the day doesn't feel depressing or empty. So hit the slopes, suck down some dim sum, or keep your couch from floating away, but be sure you make Christmas your own. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        Resistance bands are portable, convenient, and definitely have their uses. It’s no wonder they’re popular—but why are \"booty bands\" the focus of so many butt-centered workouts? Let me explain what's going on here, and where these bands can actually help your workout routine.What exactly are booty bands? A \"booty band\" is a nickname for a type of resistance band that is a short loop, usually a few inches wide, and either made of rubber or a thick elasticized fabric. (The fabric ones are more comfortable to use.) The length makes them perfect for exercises that call for a band around your legs. This includes a lot of hip exercises that, yes, can build up your butt muscles. I have a fabric set similar to this one. I don't really do \"booty\" workouts, but I find this type of band useful for the hip warmups that I sometimes do before squats or Olympic lifts. When I was rehabbing a knee injury I remember a lot of this type of exercise at my physical therapy appointments. So they're definitely useful for more than just booty-building. \nBy the way, there is a company called Booty Bands, but the term “booty bands” has also been applied to the general category of resistance bands that can go around your knees or thighs. There is no shortage of workouts that incorporate the use of these bands into squats and kickbacks and glute bridges, all while promising you major booty gains. As with many popular workouts, though, the promises are overblown.Resistance bands come with general pros and consBefore we delve into booty-focused bands in particular, it’s worth taking a look at the pros and cons of all resistance bands. I compared them with dumbbells here, and as you may recall, the takeaways included: Resistance bands can provide more total “weight” than small dumbbells.Resistance bands wear out over time.Resistance bands change in how challenging they are depending on how much you stretch them.If your home gym items need to be small and cheap, you can get a lot further with resistance bands than with dumbbells. That's because it's easy to find upper-body exercises you can do with smaller dumbbells, but you have to go a good bit heavier to find challenging lower-body workouts. Your main options are resistance band exercises, and single-leg bodyweight exercises (without a resistance band) like lunges and split squats.Easy exercises don’t do you any favorsIf you are trying to build a butt, you’re trying to build muscle. And the most efficient way to build muscle is to lift heavy—not a million reps of light work (although that can work, if you are very patient).So how do you know if you’re working hard or “heavy” enough? As I’ve mentioned before, you want to be doing smallish numbers of reps (12 or less, most of the time) that are hard enough that the last few reps feel truly challenging. If you’ve been using the same band or weight for a while, try a more challenging one from time to time to find out if you’re stronger than you think. If you are, it’s time to move up. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI mention this here because the banded portion of a “booty” workout is usually fairly easy and light. If you’re doing banded exercises and they fit my definition of heavy and they feel genuinely challenging to you, then they may well be doing what they promise. Stick with the bands for now. But bands may not be enough for your whole workout. For many of us, actual heavy weights will be necessary to give your butt (or any body part) an appropriate workout. Champion deadlifters need a lot of strength in their butt, but you won’t see powerlifters eschewing the barbell to focus on banded YouTube workouts, you know? They will often use bands in addition to the barbell, though. Bands are great for warmups and accessoriesPut all of this together, and it’s clear that bands make the most sense as a side dish to your workout—or an appetizer, or a dessert. To build muscle, the main course should still probably be a heavier workout with weights, if you can swing that. If not, you need to make sure your banded exercises are heavy enough. If you bring your bands to the gym, you can do banded kickbacks as part of your warmup, or as a high-rep finisher after leg day. You can use them for “activation” exercises, which is more or less a newfangled word for warmup. And then you can move on to your squats, deadlifts, weighted lunges, or hip thrusts. Which brings me to another point about using booty bands at the gym: if you’re doing squats with a band around your knees, the squats are doing the real work, with the band offering—to continue our food metaphor—perhaps a small garnish. \n            ",

According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, around 15,000 people in the U.S. go to the emergency room every year for holiday decorating-related injuries. And no one is keeping statistics on the countless serious injuries my eyes suffer when I see neighbors with a half-ass light display. So let's avoid all that unpleasantness with this ultimate guide to Christmas lights, from planning, to tools, tips, safety, and storage.Make a Christmas light hanging planThe time to think about how you're going to hang your holiday lights is not when you're up on the ladder, so first, sit down and make a comprehensive plan for lights before you do anything else. Here are some steps and things to keep in mind:Assess your space: Consider your roofline, windows, trees, shrubs, and walkways and decide what you're going to light up. Then develop an overall vision for your light display. How much is enough: Decide whether you'd like a maximalist, minimalist, or traditionalist display. Choose a color scheme: A coherent look to your holiday lights is so important, I made a whole section about it below. Skip ahead if needed.Highlight architectural details: You want the lights to go around windows, roofs, and doorways. Decide on your lights: Do you want string lights, icicle lights, net lights, projectors? Props and other decorations: There are so many outdoor decorations available for all styles, from fairly understated displays to Santa in a pickup truck, that you kind of have to have something. Just make sure it fits in with the overall vibe. We're going for coherence here. Measure it: Now that you know what you're going for, it's time to measure. The first step to measuring is to throw away your old tape measures and get a laser. Here's a laser measurer for less than $30. Get something like this and you won't have to climb a ladder to know how long your roofline is. Consider the power: Make sure you know where the outlets are and whether you have enough extension cords. Check your older lights: Part of planning is checking if the gear you already have is still working, so mix up some eggnog and make sure those old strings of lights still function. Choose your color palette wiselyAnyone can throw some lights up, but throwing up lights with intention is what separates us from chimpanzees. Here's some color theory for your Christmas light display:\nPick a palette: The most obvious choice is red, green, and white, but consider other options like white, blue, and silver for a winter wonderland look, or red, white, and pink for candy cane vibes. Limit your colors: You could go for a maximalist, every color look, but it's hard to pull-off without it looking like a Christmas thrift store. Be careful with the flair: If you're going to have lights that twinkle, chase, or change color, make sure it's part of an overall cohesive look. One flashing light amongst a bunch of static strings is not what you want. Remember that LED Christmas lights are superiorIf you’re still using those old-school incandescent mini bulbs, shame on you. Stop being a caveman. LED lights are better than incandescent in all of these ways: They're cool: LED lights run at about half the heat of older style bulbs, so they are unlikely to set anything on fire, even if you try. They last forever: LEDs can run for tens of thousands of hours. They'll outlive you.They use less energy: LEDs use about 10% of the energy that old school bulbs use. They are independent: Remember back in the day, when your whole string of lights was shot if one bulb went out? That's the past, man. LEDs don't care whether other LEDs are dead or not.They're versatile: LEDs can be super bright or subdued. You can get LEDs that change color, blink, simulate a meteor shower, and other special effects. You can get LED lights that are controlled from your phone and powered by batteries. They're just better.Gather your supplies and toolsHaving followed these steps, you should know exactly how many feet of lights you need and what color they should be, but that's not the whole story. You need tools and other supplies, too. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA decent ladder: Make sure your ladder is safe.Clips: You'll need a ton of clips and hooks. Extension cordsGloves and zip tiesHow to hang Christmas lightsHere's some tips for actually hanging the lights:Safety first: Hanging holiday lights is the most embarrassing way to injure yourself. It's just not worth it, so make doubly sure you have a plan for everything, don't take any risks, and get a helper to hold the ladder. Start at the power source: Always begin where your lights will plug in. Starting elsewhere is a  Griswold move that will ruin Christmas. Work outward from the outlet so you don’t run out of cord length mid-roofline. Re-test your lights: You should have already tested them, but test each string again before you string 'em up. It's much easier to deal with a loose connection on the ground than up on a ladder.Use clips and hooks instead of nails: Nails can damage your house or even cause electrical fires, so don't nail anything. Bonus: Hooks make taking everything down in January much easier.Hang lights evenly: Space out the bulbs so you don't end up with a spaghetti look. Follow the lines of your house for the best looking display. Wrap trees and shrubs neatly: For trees, start at the trunk and work outward. For small bushes, wrap in a spiral pattern from bottom to top. How to remove and store Christmas lightsWhen the holidays are over, it's time to put everything back until next year. Resist the temptation to just clump everything up and throw it in boxes—you will not be happy with yourself next year. Do not just leave everything strung up either; you're a civilized person. Reverse the installation: Do it all backwards. Remove lights starting from the farthest point from the outlet. Remove lights from trees from the outside-in and from the bottom up. Wrap carefully: To avoid a \"ball of despair\" next Christmas, wrap your lights around something—a makeshift spool or just a piece of cardboard work wonders.Label each strand: Denote where it went (roofline, bushes, tree, etc.) with a piece of masking tape and a Sharpie. Store hooks and clips: A dedicated container for hooks and clips is a must. Fishing tackle boxes work great for this. Store securely: Keep all your gear in a cool, dry place, in a plastic storage bin, so you can be ready for next year. Do not use cardboard boxes. Instead, get something like these Rubbermaid tubs. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

Whether you spent all year chasing the “perfect” gift or simply procrastinated, your time is nearly up. But don’t panic. The clock may have run out, but your options haven’t. Before you resort to re-gifting something from the back of a closet, here’s how to pull off a last-minute gift that is effortless but feels elevated and worthy of the person you’re giving it to.Sometimes the gift is in the deliveryWith the right presentation, even the most last-minute gift can read as thoughtful. Any performer will tell you that the difference between a good show and a bad one comes down to commitment and confidence. The same is true for last-minute gifts: If you act like your gift is thoughtful and intentional, they’ll think it is. The biggest mistake people make is apologizing as they hand over a present—nothing ruins a vibe faster than, “Sorry this is so last-minute.” So give with confidence.And focus on presentation. A handwritten note that contains a shared memory or personal joke can elevate a present. Use simple but personal wrapping; kraft paper and twine, or a reusable gift bag that looks like you planned ahead. Add a small flourish, like a sprig of rosemary or a fancy bow. Small touches can make it seem like you’ve carefully prepared. What you don’t want are obvious panic gifts that scream, “I grabbed this on the way here.” The goal is effortless, not frantic. Here are some suggestions.\nInstant purchase digital giftsDigital gifts are your friends. You can order something in minutes that arrives instantly online, and with a little thought, will still read as personal and intentional. The trick is choosing a present that speaks to the recipient’s tastes, hobbies, or quirks, and pairing it with a small note to show you remember what they love. From eBooks to streaming subscriptions, these gifts hit the sweet spot of thoughtful and last-minute. Here are some suggestion:Kindle unlimited subscriptionIf you have a reader on your list, they want books, and a Kindle Unlimited subscription lets them read anything they like. It can be ordered instantly and lets users access millions of titles, including audiobooks, for six months or a year, even if they don’t have a Kindle reader. Include a note that says something like, \"I know how much you love discovering new stories. Now you can explore as many as you like—just make sure you tell me what you find!” Boom! Mission accomplished.Gift cards that aren't impersonalWhen time is running out, gift cards are your secret weapon. They arrive instantly online, don’t require shipping, and with the right presentation, they can feel surprisingly thoughtful. The key is to pick a card that fits the recipient’s interests and add a personal note. The more specific you are, the better. If your giftee is into Italian food, get them an Eataly gift card. If they're a PC gamer, get them a Steam card. If they're into education, a membership to Skillshare is perfect. There's a gift card out there for just about any interest, and all you have to do it google it and email it. Making generic gift cards seem thoughtfulGeneric gift cards can be a last-minute lifesaver that can still seem a little personal if you give them the right way. Pick a theme or design: Many online cards, like Amazon, Etsy, or Starbucks, let you choose designs. The right visual makes the card feel more intentional.Include a warm, personal message: Even one line can make a digital card feel thoughtful—something like, “I couldn’t pick just one thing for you. Hope this helps you treat yourself!”Send strategically: Deliver the card by email or text, but consider printing the email or screenshotting it in a small envelope so it feels like a “real” gift.Subscription boxes with instant confirmation emailsSign someone up for a subscription service, write a note explaining you want to keep giving them presents all year, and you're golden. Here are some suggestions:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSnackCrate: This service sends a different snack from around the world every month. SpiceClub: For the culinary adventurer on your list. A subscription to RawSpiceBar’s Spice Club delivers a curated selection of spices every month.Mocktail variety box: Booze-free fancy drinks delivered once a month? Sign me up. Thera Box: If you know someone in need of some self-care, this once-a-month box is packed with wellness and relaxation items.Loot Crate: If your giftee is geeky, consider this monthly surprise box of pop culture treasures. Send a message from a celebrityCameo is a platform where celebrities, influencers, musicians, and performers create personalized video messages for fans. If someone on your list is a fan of someone on Cameo, you can set up a session, and give a card with a mysterious note like \"Keep an eye out for a special message.\" They'll be delighted when Kenny G. sends them a video. Experiential giftsI have enough crap in my house, so I love getting experiences instead of things. The challenge with experience gifts is usually timing: Many require reservations or coordination, but there are plenty of options that let your giftee schedule the time, making them perfect last-minute gifts.Museum membership cards: Many institutions sell digital gift memberships that the recipient can activate whenever they like.Movie tickets: Your local multiplex probably has a gift certificate you can buy online. Local attraction passes: Some city attractions offer gift cards or “anytime admission” tickets that don’t expire immediately.Pair these with a note explaining why you chose the experience, or, if you have that kind of relationship, something like, \"I want to take you to the Museum of Modern Art\" or whatever. Just make sure you follow through and actually go. Really last-minute, on-the-way-to-the-party gifts Sometimes, there’s literally no time to order, wrap, or even think about a gift. If you’re scrambling out the door and need something now, you might be able to fake your way through, even if you're stopping at the liquor store on the way to the Christmas party. Easy on-the-way optionsFlowers or a small potted plant: Give a seasonal bouquet or a small indoor plant. Add a handwritten note, even a single line, and it might come off as thoughtful. Gourmet chocolates or candy: Specialty chocolates from a local shop or grocery store display can feel luxe with a little ribbon or bag.Wine, craft beer, or non-alcoholic beverage: A bottle with a clean label or interesting packaging immediately elevates your gift. Ask the clerk at the liquor store to help you find something unique. Lottery tickets: Who wouldn't appreciate a bunch of scratch-off lottery tickets? When all else fails, give cashHard cash is the most impersonal gift of all, but the only one you know will be used. This gift really depends on the person getting it, so be aware of whether they're likely to think \"Just what I wanted!\" or \"Wait, I'm not poor.\" If you give cash, make sure it's crisp bills in a nice card, with a personalized note. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is warning consumers about a type of fraud in which threat actors pretend to be from trusted financial institutions in order to obtain login credentials and gain access to financial and personal data. The consequences are high: With stolen credentials, scammers can gain full control of your accounts and your money. According to the FBI advisory, criminals will quickly wire funds from your bank to cryptocurrency wallets, making the money nearly impossible to trace and recover, and lock you out of your account in the process. Here's how account takeover scams work—and how to avoid becoming a victim. \nAccount takeover scams may impersonate your bankMost account takeover scams use social engineering: a series of tactics designed to manipulate you into giving up personal information, downloading malware, or paying money to bad actors. Scammers impersonate financial institution employees as well as customer support and technical support staff and reach out to targets via text, call, or email to say that their account has been compromised in some way.They may tell you that there have been fraudulent charges on your account and send you a link to report the fraud—but this is actually a phishing site designed to harvest your login credentials. They may ask directly for your username, password, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) code over the phone. In some cases, they may even claim that your information was used to buy firearms and pass you off to a second scammer impersonating law enforcement. They're counting on you to feel fear and confusion and act quickly to \"resolve\" the issue by handing over your information. The FBI has also identified a version of account takeover using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, in which scammers buy ads that appear to be for legitimate businesses but actually allow them to place malicious links to spoofed bank websites higher in search results. How to avoid falling for account takeover scamsWhile being targeted for an account takeover may be unavoidable, there are a few red flags that can help you identify the fraud before it goes south. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you should always be wary of calls, texts, emails, and other communication (such as social media messages) from someone claiming to be from your bank or creditor, especially if they ask for personal information like your username, password, or time-based one-time password (TOTP). Reputable institutions will not contact you to request your credentials or other sensitive data—so these are almost certainly phishing attempts. You should also be wary of trusting websites that look like they belong to your financial institution, especially if you click to them from a browser search. Cybercriminals can easily build convincing (but spoofed) websites and place the malicious links at the top of search results. Bookmark the trusted link rather than going through a search engine, or use the verified app on your mobile device. Always avoid clicking directly from unsolicited communication, and check URLs and email addresses carefully, as scammers can also use homographs to hide malicious links.  Finally, protect your personal information. Use complex, unique passwords stored securely (such as in a password manager), enable a stronger form of MFA (and never give away codes), and limit what you share online. Scammers may use what you've posted—like your date of birth, pet's name, or information about family members—to get past your security questions, guess your password, or make an impersonation attempt sound more convincing. The IC3 also recommends monitoring your financial accounts for irregularities, such as unauthorized withdrawals or transfers, which may be a sign of an account takeover. Consider setting up transaction alerts with your financial institutions to be notified immediately of any suspicious activity. \n            ",

The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

I've always enjoyed keeping useful menu bar apps there, such as clipboard managers, app launchers, or apps that update other apps. But unfortunately, if you've installed more than a few third-party apps on your MacBook, your menu bar might be pretty cluttered. It's nothing a quick clean-up can't fix, though, and now macOS ships with a few ways to help fix your messy menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nJust as you'd remove unwanted items from your desk, you should periodically declutter the menu bar by removing apps that don't need to be there. This doesn't uninstall those apps, but it does free up some space in your menu bar. I do this for menu bar icons I never end up clicking. macOS 26 Tahoe has an easy way to remove apps from the menu bar. Follow these steps to do it:Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen.Go to System Settings > Menu Bar.In the right pane, navigate to the section called Allow in the Menu Bar.You'll see a list of apps that have a menu bar icon. You can uncheck any app you want to remove.Some apps also offer a way to remove their icons from the menu bar. Try checking your apps' settings to see if they let you remove their menu bar icons.\nNote that removing a menu bar icon for an app can sometimes cause the app to become \"headless,\" which means that it'll be running in the background but its icon won't show up in either the menu bar or the dock. This is fine for apps that you only need to configure once, but it can become a problem if you want to use the app regularly. In such cases, you can use a Spotlight search (Cmd + Space, or the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar) or alternatives such as Alfred or Raycast to search for the app's name and open it.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm sure you've noticed that the menu bar has more than just app icons. It's also home to the clock, wifi, volume controls, and more. You can easily add or remove these controls from the menu bar, as long as you're running macOS Tahoe. Here's how:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGo to System Settings > Menu Bar.Head over to the Menu Bar Controls section.Uncheck any control you want to remove from the menu bar.You cannot entirely remove the clock from the menu bar, but you can click Clock Options… and switch to Analog to make its icon a lot smaller.Drag and drop icons to rearrange the menu bar\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou also have the option of dragging and dropping your app icons around the menu bar, or using drag-and-drop to remove them from the menu bar. Just hold the Command key and drag any menu bar icon to a different position within the menu bar to rearrange it. To remove icons from the menu bar using drag-and-drop, hold Command and drag-and-drop them outside the menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTo tame the chaos at the top of your Mac's screen, I strongly recommend using a menu bar manager app. These apps will automatically show or hide menu bar icons based on triggers (eg: the battery icon will only show up when your MacBook's charge is below 25%), or add a second row of icons that's visible only when you click the menu bar. You'll need to try a couple of menu bar managers to decide which one works best for you.

I started with a basic bidet added onto a standard toilet, but I always knew the time would come when I would make a big upgrade. That time was this Black Friday when I pulled the trigger on the Loniko Smart Toilet, and I'm so glad I did. It's $444.99 (originally $549.99) after using the additional $30 on-page coupon, and it's worth every penny.\nMy first experience with the Loniko Smart Toilet was over Thanksgiving, which I spent at my parents house; they were very excited for my brothers and me to try their new splurge in their guest bathroom: the toilet. The lid opened when I walked into the bathroom, welcoming me to sit on its heated seat. As I said, I've been using bidets in my home for years, but never one like the Loniko. The toilet comes with a remote you can prop on your wall for easy access. You can control the bidet's stream and direction, turn on the dryer, which was surprisingly effective and gentle, and do all the things the toilet does automatically, like opening and closing the lid, flushing, etc. After realizing that most decent bidets cost upwards of $300, I decided to snatch this toilet when it went on sale during Black Friday.Being able to control the temperature of the water in the stream is a huge deal for me, especially in the winter when the water in my home is extremely cold. Cleaning the toilet is also pretty easy. It has a skirted design, so there are no nooks and crannies near the base where dirt can get trapped. The toilet also automatically cleans itself after each flush. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep in mind you'll need an outlet close by to enable all its fancy features. You can also choose to get a tankless model, which results in quieter flushes, saves water and energy, and looks more modern, but it's harder to install (I went with the regular tank toilet and it flushes quietly enough for me).\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

We are so inundated with spam calls these days that refusing to answer incoming calls en masse isn't actually a bad strategy. When that call could be someone trying to break into your bank account, or alerting you to fraudulent credit card charges that never happened, perhaps it's best to just wait for friends and family to text instead. But let's say the call is from you to someone you know and trust, and let's assume they see it's you who's calling. Even though they know the call isn't spam, there are still plenty of reasons someone won't pick up the phone—including, of course, because they don't actually want to talk right now. But if you really need to get a hold of someone and don't want meetings, commutes, or the lack of desire for a phone call to get in the way, Google is currently working on a solution you can try right now. The new feature, named \"Call Reason,\" is designed to separate important phone calls from the rest. When you start dialing a number, Google will give you the option to mark the call as urgent. If you choose to do so, the person you're calling will see a pop-up reading \"It's urgent!\" on the call screen. Hopefully, that pop-up will encourage them to answer; however, I imagine they'll stop picking up if you start using it too often. \nThat said, not everyone ignores calls on purpose. If you aren't by your phone when it goes off, or if it's on silent in your pocket or bag, you obviously won't catch the urgent tag on the call screen. In that case, Android adds the urgent tag to the missed call in their recipient's call history. As long as the person you're trying to reach checks out their missed calls, they should see that this one was marked urgent—though if it's a real emergency, they might've received extra calls and messages from you in the interim anyway. It seems Google has been working on this feature for some time. Android Authority previously spotted something called Expressive Calling in the Phone app's APK, which would let the caller add animations and emojis to calls. In addition to that functionality, however, was the ability to flag the reason for a call when dialing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to try Call Reason Google is still testing the Call Reason feature, but anyone using the current version of the Google Phone app will be able to try it out. (It's still rolling out, though, so you may not see it yet.) The feature also only works with saved contacts, and when calling Android users who have Google's Phone app set as the primary calling app.  When Call Reason does show up on your phone, you'll see it appear after placing your call. The UI says \"Mark call as urgent?,\" with a prompt letting you know that the call will ring through and show the call is urgent. Tap \"Notify,\" and you're set. Once the recipient sees the call, they'll see the \"Incoming call\" banner replaced by an animated \"It's urgent!\" pop-up. It's a fun design, but perhaps a bit too fun, when you're likely using this in important situations.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nAlongside Call Reason, Google announced a number of new features for Android 16. There are now improved parental controls locked behind a PIN of the parents' choosing; new UI customization options, like expanded dark mode support and new custom shapes for home screen icons; and the continued roll out of Google's AI notification summaries, which Lifehacker writer David Nield hasn't found all that useful yet.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

One of Rockstar's most impactful games, Red Dead Redemption, turned 15 in May. All these years later, it's still very much worth your time—if critics and fans have anything to say about it. On Tuesday, Rockstar announced some big news for the first Red Dead: First, anyone who owns a copy of the game for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, can now upgrade to the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or Nintendo Switch 2 versions for free. That includes upgrades like 60 fps, upgraded visuals, support for HDR, and 4K resolution—at least on PlayStation and Xbox. But console gamers aren't the only ones impacted here. Rockstar also revealed that Red Dead Redemption is now available on mobile for the first time ever. This could open the game up to a whole new market of players who don't own a console—if your primary gaming device is your smartphone or tablet, you can now check out Red Dead Redemption in its entirety. Depending on your device, you may even have access to a \"performance mode\" that boosts the frame rate of the game. Otherwise, it appears locked to 30 fps—though that might not be as noticeable on mobile as it would on a TV.  \nRed Dead on mobile is either free, or very expensiveHowever, there's a bit of a catch here. Depending on your current subscriptions, Red Dead Redemption's mobile port can either be completely free, or quite expensive. If you look at the listings for the game on the Google Play Store and iOS App Store, you'll see the game currently costs $39.99. That's pricey for a mobile game, even a console port. While there aren't many games as large as Red Dead with mobile versions, the ones that are aren't quite this expensive. Stardew Valley is $4.99; Minecraft is $6.99; GTA: San Andreas is $6.99 (though the \"Definitive\" edition is $19.99); Hitman: Absolution is $14.99. $39.99, by comparison, is steep.I'm not saying Red Dead isn't worth $40, but you need to be sure you want to commit to the mobile port of the game—especially if you have other means of playing it. The PS4 version is currently $29.99 at Best Buy: If you have either a PS4 or PS5, you can enjoy the game on your TV for $10 less. Plus, PS5 owners can upgrade to the higher-performing version for free.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpeaking of free, however, there is a way to play Red Dead Redemption on the go without spending anything—or, at least, anything extra. If you have an active Netflix subscription, you can download the Netflix version on your iPhone or Android free of charge. It's the same game, just validated through your Netflix account—so if you have a Netflix subscription, I highly recommend you download this version before you spend money on the game.  If it sounds weird that Netflix is offering Red Dead for free, I don't blame you. However, this isn't really something new for the company. Netflix has been offering free games for subscribers for four years now, and while some of them are Netflix-owned, others are major titles the company licenses. That includes games like Into the Breach, Moonlighter, Heads Up!, and, of course, Red Dead Redemption. Netflix doesn't even require you to have a specific subscription to access these games: All subs, including its cheapest \"With Ads\" plan, can play.If you've never played Red Dead Redemption, the cheapest way to experience the game right now is to subscribe to Netflix for a month. You could pay $7.99 for the company's least expensive plan, and after catching up on Stranger Things, you could play through all of Red Dead.

The concept of unfolding a smartphone to reveal a tablet-sized display was simply too cool to be possible. Of course, not only are foldables a reality today, there are a number of models out there to choose from. Samsung released its first Galaxy Z Fold back in 2019, and while the foldable market isn't nearly as hot as traditional smartphones, they are very much an option for anyone who isn't afraid of the inflated MSRP.   On Monday, Samsung unveiled its latest foldable smartphone: the Galaxy Z TriFold. Unlike the Z Fold, however, this new device doesn't have two displays: It has three. The appropriately named TriFold unfolds twice to reveal \"one\" large 10-inch display. That's an additional two inches when compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 7's unfolded display size. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nSamsung claims when the TriFold is fully open, it performs on par to three 6.5-inch smartphones lined up in a row. The company has some examples of how you can take advantage of that screen real estate: You could have three windows open at once, all the same uniform design; two windows, one smaller and one larger; or one huge window with multiple on-screen elements of its own. You can also watch videos on platforms like YouTube while reading comments at the same time. \nPlus, the TriFold acts as its own Samsung DeX workstation. You can treat it like a small personal computer, saving up to four workspaces that can each run five apps at once. That means you can switch between as many as 20 apps all running at the same time, across four preset workspaces. You can also connect the TriFold to an external monitor, plus pair the foldable with a mouse and keyboard for a more traditional computing experience.  TriFold Samsung says the TriFold uses a \"refined\" version of its Armor FlexHinge to support the new triad displays. It uses two hinges of different sizes to stabilize folding and to reduce the gap between them, and adds a thin piece of metal to protect the folding mechanism. The design prevents the displays from actually touching each other when closed, which should reduce the chance of cracks or damage.Galaxy Z TriFold specsWhile we haven't seen much of the phone in action yet, we do have the device's on-paper specs. Here's what you can expect:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMain screen: 2160 x 1584 10-inch AMOLED, 120 Hz refresh rate, 1600 nits of peak brightnessCover screen: 2520 x 1080 6.5-inch AMOLED, 120 Hz refresh rate, 2600 nits of peak brightnessDimensions: 159.2 x 75.0 x 12.9 mm (folded); 159.2 x 214.1 x 3.9 mm (unfolded) Weight: 309gProcessor: Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for GalaxyRear cameras: 12MP, Dual Pixel AF, F2.2 (Ultra-wide); 200MP Quad Pixel AF, optical image stabilization (OIS), F1.7, 2x optical zoom (Wide); 10MP, OIS, F2.4, 3x optical zoom, 30x digital zoom (Tele)Front cameras: 10MP selfie camera, F2.2 (cover screen); 10MP main camera, F2.2 (main screen)Memory and storage: 16GB RAM, with either 512GB or 1TB of internal storageBattery: 5,600 mAhCharging: Super-Fast Charging 2.0 (45W); Wired charging up to 50% in 30 minutes (45W); Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 (15W)Water resistance: IP48Network and connectivity: 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4  When is the Galaxy Z TriFold available?Again, this isn't a concept or prototype: The TriFold is just about ready for launch. Customers in South Korea are the first to get a chance to try the TriFold, as Samsung is planning on a Dec. 12 release.This is the only firm release date that Samsung currently has for the TriFold, but that doesn't mean the rest of the world is in the dark. Samsung says users in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the UAE will have access shortly after that Dec. 12 release, while those of us in the U.S. will have our shot in the first quarter of 2026.Release dates can change, but if Samsung sticks to this plan, we should be able to check out the TriFold here by the end of March. We don't know the U.S. price at this time, but we do know the Korean price: KRW 3,590,400. That converts to just shy of $2,450. For reference, the Z Fold 7 lists for $1,999.99. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Now, the second big Android 16 update is here, ushering in a host of new features across notifications, customization, accessibility, and device restrictions.As is the norm, this update will arrive on Pixel devices first. For other Android devices, including those made by Samsung, it's up to each phone and tablet manufacturer to adjust the software update as needed and push it out to their users. Despite the limited rollout, Google says this marks a \"new chapter\" for Android releases, which, going forward, will be \"more frequent\" rather than once a year. In other words, we might be seeing Android 17 much sooner than expected. But we won't see it today. We're still in the Android 16 era, which is about to get the following new features and changes:\nMore interface customization\n    \n            \n            You now have more control over home screen icons.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nCustomization has always been one of the strengths of Android, and this Android 16 update brings with it a bunch of features to help you change the interface in a more flexible and consistent way. Home screen icons can now have custom shapes, while themed icons are auto-applied across apps.Both of those changes should mean that when you play around with the visual look of Android, there isn't a jarring icon or two that stands out from the rest—everything should look more uniform. \"Your phone should reflect your own unique aesthetic,\" Google says, and these tweaks should help.There's also an improvement to dark mode: Dark mode will now be applied across all apps, even those that haven't been coded to include a dark mode by their developer. Again, the end result should be a more consistent visual look, plus extra savings on battery life if more of the screen is dimmed more often.Improved parental controls\n    \n            \n            More parental controls can now be managed on-device.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIf you have kids who use an Android device, you'll know the current parental controls are a little bit clunky, and mostly managed remotely. Going forward, more of these controls will be available on the actual devices your youngsters are using, which should mean they're easier to access and manage.The new on-board settings will be protected by a PIN, so your kids can't change them, and will cover screen time, downtime schedules, and app usage. You'll also be able to add more time for app and device usage from the phone or tablet that's being used, which is more convenient if you're actually with a child.Additionally, Google is making it easier to set up a Google Family Link from Android 16 phones and tablets, which is where the family connections and device rules are set to begin with. Other key parental controls, including protections over purchases and location tracking, are still managed remotely.AI in your notifications\n    \n            \n            AI will group and summarize your notifications.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nTechnically launched in last month's Pixel Drop, Android 16 now summarizes your notifications for you through the power of AI—something that tech companies are continuing to push, in an effort to save us all time and avoid notification fatigue, even if the results have been mixed so far. Why Google is announcing it alongside these other new features isn't clear, but it's a good reminder for any Pixel users who might be interested in trying it out.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI summaries are something Apple introduced for the iPhone, then partially pulled for certain apps, then brought back. According to Google, these AI summaries will give you \"quick understanding and context at a glance\"—so let's hope they understand what's important in your group chats and what isn't.On top of that, we're getting AI-powered notification organization too, with \"lower-priority notifications\" (which Google says include promotions and social alerts) silenced and grouped together so they're not so much of a distraction. As yet, it's not clear exactly how much control you'll get over how all this works.And even more updates\n    \n            \n            You'll be able to mark your calls as urgent in the future.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThere are plenty of other minor updates rolling out to a broader selection of Android devices too, not just those running Android 16. They include more expressive closed captions; ease-of-use improvements to accessibility features, such as TalkBack (voice dictation) and Auto Click (using a mouse with Android); and pinned tabs in Chrome for Android.Emoji Kitchen is getting more features and more ways to combine emojis, Circle to Search is adding a scam detection feature (just point it towards a suspected scam message), and group chats in Google Messages will now come with options for reporting issues—chats can be easily left, blocked, and reported.We'll also soon be getting a beta version of a feature Google has named Call Reason, in the Phone app. This lets you mark your outgoing calls to saved contacts as urgent, which they'll see when you ring them (and might encourage them to pick up.

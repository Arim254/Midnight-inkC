/><p>I really don't recommend studying with other people. In my adult life, I've accumulated an Associates, Bachelors, and Masters, plus a bunch of certificates—in all those years of studying, I was frustrated with group work much more often than I was not. Sessions would devolve into chit-chat and venting sessions or someone would try to avoid pulling their weight by foisting work off on the rest of us. I became the person who would complete the entire project and let everyone put their name on it because I just wanted to avoid all that—but it was probably because I didn't know the right methods to make these sessions productive.</p><p>There are actually a few effective methods that will help you study with partners or groups, but <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-to-study-in-a-group-if-you-must-1850857034\" target=\"_blank\"><em>you have to know them before you get into that group setting</em></a>—or else run the risk of no one getting much working done. Try one of my favorite group study methods—“think, pair, share”—the next time you want to study with someone else. I wish I'd known about this one in college, but you still have a chance.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Think, pair, share is a teaching technique typically employed by instructors, but it's easily modifiable for people getting some studying done, too. According to <a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/heyteach/article/how-think-pair-share-activity-can-improve-your-classroom-discussions1704.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Western Governors University</a>, it was developed by a professor named Frank Lyman in 1981 and is helpful for shy students, as it encourages them to engage in discussion.</p><p>The name basically tells you what you need to do: </p><ul><li><p>First, you <strong>think</strong> about the subject at hand, studying it until you are pretty sure you grasp it. </p></li><li><p>Then, you <strong>pair</strong> up with someone to discuss it.</p></li><li><p>Finally, you <strong>share</strong> what you read, understand, and don’t understand with the group afterward. </p></li></ul><p>Ideally, by going over the material together, you’ll help each other fill in gaps in your understanding and enhance what you already know.</p><h2 id=\"use-tps-to-its-maximum\">Use TPS to its maximum</h2><p>Those are overly simplistic steps, so you need to have a plan for how you'll approach each one. \"Think about the subject\" is too general. On your own, you should be reading your material critically, using a reading comprehension aid like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/kwl-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a>. Those ask you to write down what you think you know, what you want to know, and what you eventually learn, which forces you to read carefully so you find the answers. When using TPS, they perform a dual function: They give you questions you can ask to the larger group, too. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>When it comes time to share, approach it with a plan, too. Volunteer to structure the study session and have everyone go around one at a time to share their favorite insight from the material or idea for the project. Split into pairs and use the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-feynman-method-to-study-1850809398\" target=\"_blank\">Feynman technique</a>, which asks you to teach a concept to another person and relies on the idea that if you can break an idea down well enough to explain it simply, you understand it well. </p><p>If you’re familiar with other group study methods, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-jigsaw-method-to-study-complex-topics-1850849174\" target=\"_blank\">jigsaw method</a> or Feynman, some of the elements of TPS might sound familiar. With jigsaw, each person in the group studies one part of the assigned text, then explains it to everyone else. When using Feynman, you explain the topic you studied as simply as you can to someone else who knows nothing about it. The difference is that with TPS, everyone in the group knows the material before discussing, so you’re not necessarily teaching anyone or being taught, so much as you’re comparing ideas.</p><p>When you’re sharing what you know, you make space for someone else to ask follow-up questions, forcing your brain to <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">use active recall</a> to search around for the answer—or sending you back to the source material to look it up. Hearing someone else’s perspective can help you reframe how you think of the topic, causing it to stick in your brain even more. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

Early access was initially reserved to a waitlist of Perplexity Max users, a subscription that costs $200 per <em>month</em>, before Perplexity opened up access to Perplexity Pro users, who only need to pay $20 per month. Still, seeing as most web browsers are free to use, I imagine most people still shied away from trying Comet because of the price.</p><p>If that sounds like you, there's good news. On Friday, Perplexity made Comet available to anyone who wants to try it for free. You don't need to subscribe to any Perplexity plan, nor do you even need a Perplexity account—though the company has some features tied to those who sign in. Comet is built on Chromium, so if you're coming from Chrome, or another Chromium browser like Edge, you'll be able to jump right in. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Installing Comet is as easy as any other web browser: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">just head to Perplexity's website</a>, and choose \"Download Comet.\" Even setting up the browser feels familiar, as you can import another Chrome profile, choose a profile pic, and set a name. But of course, the real advertised advantage here is the AI assistant. Like other AI-powered browsers, Comet has a built-in chatbot you can talk to about whatever it is you want—particularly the web pages you happen to be browsing. But Comet's AI is agentic, which means you can ask the AI to do things for you. </p><p>If you ask it to take you to a specific website, it will (though I'm not sure that's any faster than simply typing in the site by hand). If you ask it to open a specific link on the page, you can see the bot take over the page, and choose the URL you asked for. For example, I asked the assistant to open Lifehacker, then asked it to click on our article \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-browse-the-dark-web\" target=\"_blank\">How to Browse the Dark Web</a>.\" It did both of these things, and even offered a summary of the dark web piece.  </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But Perplexity says you can also request more complex tasks: According to the company, the assistant can draft emails on your behalf, build websites, make purchases, create citations, add to your calendar. There's even a voice mode, as with other AI bots like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-is-out-now\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/gemini-live-is-now-available-to-all-android-users-for-free\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, so you can talk to the browser if you want to. </p><p>I'm still not sold on the idea that injecting agentic AI into my web browser is what I need to better experience the internet. Maybe I need to spend some time with Comet to experience that \"future.\" But seeing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+hallucination+lifehacker&udm=14\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">how often the tech still makes mistakes</a>—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/prompt-injection-attacks-ai-browsers\" target=\"_blank\">not the mention the untapped security risks</a>—I'm not sure I want to hand off all of my browsing tasks to AI just yet. Still, if you're interested, you can give it a go without spending a dime.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Recently, a 911 call surfaced of a North Carolina man calling authorities because he thought he saw a bloody man by the side of a desolate country road. While he was speaking to the operator, <em>something</em> landed in the bed of his pickup truck, causing the 911 caller to start screaming \"It's not <em>human</em>! It's not <em>human</em>!\"  </p><p>Check out the video:</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My first reaction upon seeing this was the same as yours: It's fake. Compelling, sure. but fake, like 100,000 other online \"paranormal videos.\" There's no picture of the creature. We don't know who the guy is. We don't know the context. There's no effort and no risk in making and posting a video online, so there's no reason to think it's real, so I swiped to the next video. But it turns out there's enough evidence here that it at least deserves a deeper look. </p><h2 id=\"the-true-part-of-the-story\">The true part of the story </h2><p>Unlike the overwhelming majority of spooky videos posted online, a big part of this story <em>is</em> true. It's a real recording of a 911 call placed at 11 p.m. on July 31, 2021 in Pender County, North Carolina. The verifiable details that the caller reported in the call are accurate too. <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/thats-not-human-north-carolina-911/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Snopes</a> listened to the entire 11-minute 911 call, and cross-checked the details to make sure the distance the caller said he'd driven check out, and they do. </p><p>The caller didn't hang up, either. He waited around for Pender County Sheriff's department officers to arrive, and he cooperated with the investigation. This means an actual person out there is willing to stand behind the story—that's a much higher level of evidence than most paranormal claims online have. The cops didn't find anything, but that was in keeping with the 911 call, too: Dude said he slammed on the brakes and the inhuman thing in his truck bed flew out, landed on the road, and took off into the woods. </p><p>\"It's some yahoo calling in a hoax report to 911,\" you might be saying. Fair point, but that's a crime, and the unnamed caller was apparently believable enough that he wasn't arrested for filing a bogus police report. The sheriff took the incident seriously enough to open up a file about it, use state resources to look into it, and later do a media interview.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-much-evidence-is-enough-evidence\">How much evidence is enough evidence?</h2><p>If the 911 caller had been reporting something else in this call, like a wounded deer in the highway or something, we wouldn't question whether it actually happened. The recording and the police report would be overkill; we'd believe the guy just because he <em>said</em> it happened. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But I'm still 99.99% sure this guy either mistook something mundane for a monster or made up a tale entirely. </p><p>According to the 911 caller, the thing in the back of his pickup truck had shallow sunken eyes, and no nose, like someone had \"taken skin and put it on a human skull and stretched it thin.\" It was not human. As Carl Sagan once said, \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" and a mystery creature in South Carolina would certainly be extraordinary. If it was true, it would upend everything we know about biology, zoology, evolution, and North Carolina. I'm open to the possibility, but we need more than a 911 call to accept it. We'd need extraordinary evidence: video, photos, corroborating witnesses, and physical evidence wouldn't even be enough. You'd have to catch one before it would make sense to rewrite the zoology textbooks. </p><h2 id=\"there-actually-could-be-a-monster-in-north-carolina\">There actually could be a monster in North Carolina</h2><p>Don't lose hope, all you \"I want to believe\" people. It could still be real. Up until the mid-1800s, gorillas were basically Bigfoot, as far as Western science was concerned: A few people told tales of spotting them deep in the jungle, but there wasn't a compelling reason to think they existed. Same with giant squids: Occasionally a sailor would swear he encountered one, but it wasn't until the 1840s that there was physical evidence, and we didn't have a photo of a giant squid until <em>2004</em>. </p><p>Yeah, a previously undiscovered creature would have a harder time hiding out in modern North Carolina than gorillas had staying scarce in Cameroon in the 1840s, but it's October, so I'm calling it a (barely, technically possible) mystery instead of an outright lie.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

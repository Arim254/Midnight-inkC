Like Google I/O or Apple's fall event, Unpacked is Samsung's keynote, where the company shows off what it's been working on since, well, the last Unpacked. Like previous keynotes, this year's should be full of big Samsung news, all of which you can watch live as it happens.When is Galaxy Unpacked 2026?Samsung's big presentation will kick off in San Francisco on Wednesday, Feb. 25. Like many tech events, Galaxy Unpacked starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET). While Samsung is hosting a live presentation for a limited number of media and guests, anybody can tune into Galaxy Unpacked 2026 as it happens. The company is streaming the show from a number of websites, including Samsung.com, Samsung Newsroom, and Samsung's official YouTube channel. The YouTube livestream is currently up, but, of course, you won't see much until 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday. \nWhat will Samsung announce at Galaxy Unpacked 2026?Usually, all we have is rumors and conjecture when reporting on what a company like Samsung will reveal during a big hardware event. We still need to do that in this case, but, that said, the company outright told us what its biggest announcement will be. When Samsung first announced Unpacked 2026 a couple weeks ago, it said that \"the new Galaxy S series is coming,\" which, no doubt, refers to the Galaxy S26. Samsung says this new series is \"built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence, and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it's in hand.\" Whatever that means.Unpacked 2026: Galaxy S26 seriesWe can look to rumors surrounding the S26 series to paint a picture of what to expect Wednesday. As it the norm, Samsung will likely release three main S26 units: the S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. It isn't clear whether the company will release an S26 Edge this year to follow up the S25 Edge.  The standard S26 seems like it'll be a small upgrade over the current S25, though with one key change: The new Galaxy will house its three rear cameras on a raised camera bump, following in the footsteps of Apple and Google. Rumors are split as to whether the cameras themselves will be upgraded, with some speculating that the Ultra will jump from 12MP to 50MP. The S26 may pack a 6.3-inch AMOLED display, a 4,300 mAh battery, up to 12GB of RAM, and possible up to 512GB of storage. Samsung may be running with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to power the phone. The S26 Plus will likely be a similar phone, just with a larger 6.7-inch display. The S26 Ultra looks like it'll launch with four rear cameras, with three of them contained to the bump out. As usual, the Ultra is the largest of the bunch, sporting a rumored 6.9-inch display. It could even be a bit thinner than the current S25 Ultra. The cameras may get some upgrades too, though the raw numbers appear to the same as the S25 Ultra. For example, while both may have 200MP main sensors, the S26's sensor may get some upgrades. It, too, could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, as well as up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, a 5,000 mAh battery, and 60-watt fast wired charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe entire S25 series may also support 25W fast wireless charing, and may start selling a 25W Qi2 charger that supports it. They may all also support satellite communications, which would let users call and text emergency services and contacts without cellular network—similar to Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite on iPhone. Unpacked 2026: Galaxy Buds 4Samsung will likely unveiled a new pair of earbuds Wednesday alongside the S26 series: Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. If the rumors are true, the Buds 4 will come in black and the Buds 4 Pro will come in white, though both will come with a charging case with a transparent lid. Besides color, the other big difference here is how the buds fit: The Buds 4 Pro are rumored to come with silicone tips, like AirPods Pro, while the Buds 4 do not, like Apple's standard AirPods. Unpacked 2026: AIFinally, expect some big AI announcements, especially as they pertain to the S26 series. In a press release on Sunday, Samsung announced an \"expansion of Galaxy AI\" to support \"a choice of integrated agents.\" Specifically, Samsung is partnering with Perplexity to bring its AI agents to Galaxy devices. You'll be able to say \"Hey Plex\" to access the agent, and the bot will work across Samsung apps, like Calendar, Clock, Gallery, Notes, and Reminder.At the same time, the company is currently testing the latest version of its own assistant, Bixby, with One UI 8.5. The goal is to let users ask Bixby for things on their Galaxy device, such as \"I don't want the screen to shut off when I'm looking at it,\" and the bot will adjust the proper settings in kind. The new Bixby can also access the web to answer questions, similar to other AI bots like ChatGPT or Gemini. Expect to hear more about this during Unpacked as well.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n    ",

The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar Tactical Watch is one of the brand’s best solar-charged options—an right now, it’s 40% off on Amazon, dropping its price from $499.99 to $299.99.\nCompared to its predecessor, the Garmin Instinct Solar 2X produces up to 50% more energy from the sun thanks to the Power Glass lens, which is particularly helpful in GPS mode, which can drain the battery quickly. It’s also 0.8 mm thinner, has a built-in LED flashlight, a compass, and an altimeter. It also has a number of health- and fitness-tracking features, including Pulse Ox, heart rate monitoring, and sleep monitoring stats that are meant to help you train and recover more efficiently. The watch also contains integrated sports apps.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTrackBack is another helpful feature that lets you use location readings to keep track of where you last left your car or where you started your hike, for example. That said, this device doesn't have a touchscreen; users are limited to a button-based interface, and app support on the Garmin Connect IQ app is somewhat limited. The display is also somewhat bare-bones compared to more vibrant AMOLED options like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (that said, there are some benefits to an MIP screen over AMOLED.)\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.How the Google Forms job scam worksThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job. As Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials. \nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page. How to avoid phishing attempts on your Google credentialsAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms. This is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited. As reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.If you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jake Peterson\n                    \n    \nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That is their lowest price so far, according to price trackers. PCMag gave them an “excellent” rating, largely because they deliver strong sound and active noise cancellation without pushing into premium pricing. At this price, they sit in the crowded midrange category, but they offer a feature set that competes with more expensive earbuds. \nThese IP55-rated earbuds use a dual-driver setup, with 11mm and 6mm drivers working together to produce a wide 10Hz–40kHz range. In practice, that means deep bass that feels full but not bloated, and highs that stay clear instead of sounding harsh.The Buds Pro 3 support Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint connectivity, and codecs like AAC, SBC, and LHDC 5.0 for compatible devices. If you own a recent OnePlus phone, you can access high-res audio and most settings directly through the Bluetooth menu. On other Android or iOS devices, the HeyMelody app unlocks nearly everything, including five EQ presets, a six-band custom EQ, and features like a fit test and Golden Sound tuning (which adjusts the audio profile to match the unique shape of your ear canal).As for its ANC performance, it holds up well for the price. It cuts down low engine rumble on planes and buses and reduces background chatter in busy cafes. That said, its transparency mode (while serviceable) sounds slightly artificial, notes this PCMag review. Battery life is solid but not class-leading. With noise cancellation on, you get up to six hours per charge, plus another 19 hours from the case. Turn ANC off and that jumps to about 10 hours, with 33 more from the case. It charges via USB-C and also supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAt $129.99, these are not flawless, but they cover the essentials well. You get strong sound and noise cancellation, and a long list of features that are often reserved for pricier models.te\n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers more in the way of manual shooting controls, with the added benefit of an entire integrated suite of editing features.Using Snapseed's built-in camera on iPhoneOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n    \n            \n            Look out for the new camera button in Snapseed.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer. \nOnce you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n    \n            \n            You've got some classic film styles to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.Up in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Pro controls can be called up in a couple of taps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.Most filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image.

When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.It's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.WhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.Speaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: WhatsApp\n                    \n    \nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.Still, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.WhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There's now an AI DJ, and you can use ChatGPT to generate playlists. With iOS 26.4, which is currently in beta, Apple wants you to make playlists with its own AI tech. The upcoming update includes a feature called \"Playlist Playground,\" which lets you generate AI playlists directly in the Apple Music app—as long as you're running iOS 26.4.How to download and install iOS 26.4I do not recommend installing and running beta versions of iOS on your primary iPhone. Beta software is unfinished, which means you could run into bugs and glitches that may impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss. If you're itching to try out new features, it's best to ensure that you've taken a complete backup of your iPhone first. That way, you can always revert to an older installation in case something goes wrong. Even so, it's safer to run test software on a backup iPhone as opposed to your daily driver.With that said, if you're sure you want to go ahead and install iOS 26.4 right now, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Select Beta Updates > iOS 26 Developer Beta. Now, go back to the Software Update page and wait until you see iOS 26.4 Beta 1 appear. You can now download and install the update to try this new Apple Music feature.\nHow to create AI-generated playlists in Apple MusicOnce you're on iOS 26.4, you can open the Music app to get started with this feature. Tap the Library tab in the bottom bar, and then select the New Playlist button in the top-right corner. You should see the Playlist Playground feature here. (Note that this feature may not appear on devices that don't support Apple Intelligence, or if your Apple Account is from a region where Apple has restricted the rollout of AI features.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce you activate the feature, you'll be able to generate playlists with AI. From here, you tell the AI what you want to listen to. You could get specific, with certain artists, songs, or genres, or ask for playlists that encompass a certain idea of mood. Apple has some pre-written prompts to get you started, such as \"hip-hop party songs,\" but you can use your own text prompts too. AI-generated playlists have 25 songs by default, and you do have the option to customize the playlist further after it's created. You'll also be able to edit the title, cover image, and the description of AI-generated playlists. These playlists can be shared with others or displayed on your Apple Music profile, just like other playlists you create on the streaming service. It's similar in concept to other AI playlist generators on platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music. Try AI-generated playlists without installing iOS 26.4While Apple Music's Playlist Playground feature is a good start, it's not yet available to those of us who are unwilling to install developer beta versions of iOS 26. If that's you, there are other options out there for AI generated Apple Music playlists. There's the aforementioned ChatGPT integration, of course, but you could also use a third-party app, like PlaylistAI. It has many prompts for you to get started with, and can even generate playlists from music festival posters. The app does prompt you to get a subscription, but you can skip that prompt and use the free tier to generate a playlist quickly.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Researchers at security firm LayerX have analyzed multiple campaigns in recent months involving malicious browser extensions, including the widespread GhostPoster scheme targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs. Fake Chrome extensions look like popular AI assistantsThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior. Though the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update. \nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.As part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears. While I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.    \nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther new features in this Release Preview Channel updateThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.  You can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.   \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026. What the Google Chrome patch fixesThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data. CVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system. \nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat Chrome users need to doGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on. Chrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window. Apply these updates immediately by tapping the three dots and selecting the first menu item. Chrome will need to restart to complete the update. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you have the same experience, I have good news: I've found a workaround that offers a massive improvement to Apple's built-in search function. The problem with searching in MessagesFor most people, the easiest way to search for texts on an iPhone involves opening the Messages app, tapping the search bar near the base of the screen, and typing in what you're looking for. You'll receive a variety of results, but that's the problem: It's too much information. When I search for a person's name, for example, Messages in iOS 26 shows a list of four chats where the name is mentioned, followed by two chat threads, pinned chats, shared notes, links, photos, locations, and documents. This is great when I want a more in-depth search, but when I'm just looking for a specific message, these extra details just get in the way.  \nThe fastest way to search for texts in iOS 26That's where our hack comes in. First, open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone, then install the Search and Open Messages shortcut. This shortcuts takes advantage of actions released in iOS 26, which allow you to look for text messages and open them in a single tap. Once the shortcut is installed, you can run it from the Shortcuts app, or add it to your iPhone's Home Screen for easier access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe shortcut will prompt you to type what you want to search for, and almost instantly, it'll list all the chats containing those words. In some cases, it even highlights the exact sentence containing those words. It'll find keywords in images you share, as well: These appears as \"blank\" entries in the search results, but if you tap through, you'll see the image the search identified. The moment you tap a result, the shortcut instantly takes you to the relevant part of the chat, and doesn't make you scroll through hundreds of results to find the right one. This is the kind of functionality Apple needs to add directly to Messages. But, for now, this shortcut workaround will have to do.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes. Thankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Here's how you can make use of them.\nFile creation in ClaudeClaude's file creation capabilities let you create Word documents, PowerPoint slideshows, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs from right inside a conversation. You can either supply the bot with all text, data, and other information you want included, get Claude to invent everything itself, or something in between.For example, if you've got a long list of names and scores, Claude can put them into a spreadsheet for you. If you've got a series of images, Claude can combine them into a PDF and describe them. You can get it to analyze and visualize data, produce presentations based on reports, and create summary documents.\n    \n            \n            A simple prompt can create a file in Claude.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTo enable file creation for your account, click your profile icon (bottom left) in Claude on the web, then select Settings > Capabilities and enable Code execution and file creation. With that done, you just have to prompt Claude with the type of file you want to make and what you want included, supplying any information as needed (or telling the AI where to find it online).As usual with these AI bots, the more detail and specificity you can provide, the better—the end result is then more likely to be closer to what you were aiming for. I got it to quickly come up with the results of a fictional sports day race, and produce a spreadsheet from it. While it's not the most demanding of tasks, Claude completed it correctly.Claude ConnectorsConnectors can hook Claude up to a variety of other apps, sites, and services: So if you want to get it to design something for you in Canva, or manage your messages in Slack, or find some travel deals on Trivago, then Claude can do that for you. The full list of current Connectors gives you some idea of what's possible.To get to the Connectors from the Claude prompt box, click the small + (plus) icon in the lower left corner, then choose Add connectors. You can search through Connectors by name, and filter them by type and category. When you select one you like, you'll need to supply your account credentials and give Claude permission to access your account.\n    \n            \n            Use Connectors to connect Claude to other apps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour Connectors of choice are then available from the same sub-menu in the prompt box: You can add more plug-ins and remove existing ones from there. You can either select an app, or specify the name of it in your prompt and Claude should understand what you mean. You can ask for outputs, run searches, and communicate through your connected services.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nConnectors can give Claude some handy extra talents. With the Canvas Connector, for example, I was able to create a basic bit of artwork for a birthday party flyer—something that the AI wouldn't have been able to do on its own. I find that access was spotty, however, perhaps a sign of a lot of free users now making use of these tools.Claude SkillsWith Skills, you can \"teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way\" (in the words of the official support document). In old-school computer talk, they might be referred to as macros: batches of set instructions that Claude can repeat whenever you need something doing in a particular way.Templates are a good example, whether they're for emails or documents. Rather than just getting Claude to write an email for you, you can set down some basic parameters for the job that include guidelines on tone, length, and style, as well as crucial bits of information (such as your contact details) that always need to be included.\n    \n            \n            You've got three options for creating Skills.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nClick your account profile icon (bottom left) in Claude on the web, then choose Settings > Capabilities and click Add under Skills to get started. You can create a Skill through a Claude conversation, by writing out the instructions, or by uploading a Skills file (which is handy for including extra items such as code snippets, as described here).I took the Create with Claude route to put together a basic way of summarizing PDF reports, with specific guidelines on how many paragraphs and headings to use, and the tone of voice to apply. In the future, rather than typing out those instructions every time I need something summarized, I can just invoke the Skill.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

His journalism career started in print media, where he contributed to and edited several technology magazines and bookazines sold in the U.K. and internationally. More recently, he has worked as a freelancer for some of the biggest technology publications on the web, covering everything from on-the-ground reporting about product launches, to detailed explainers and how-to guides on apps, gadgets, and platforms.

Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n    \n            \n            There's a new Create music button in Gemini.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.When you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\n    \n            \n            You can get some help with your prompting if you need it.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n    \n            \n            You also get cover art with your artificial tunes.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them. The updated Lyria 3 model is also coming to the Dream Track music maker for YouTube Shorts creators. Lyria 3 is now rolling out inside Gemini, and is available to users aged 18 and above in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese. It's available first on the web app, and will show up on the mobile app over the next few days. Expansions in \"quality and coverage\" are planned in the future, Google says.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

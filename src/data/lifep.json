Right now, the Tapo MagCam 2K+ is on sale for $64.98 on Amazon, down from $89.99, which is its lowest price to date, according to price trackers.\n PCMag named it the best security camera of 2024, pointing out that while battery-powered cameras often trade convenience for frequent recharging, the MagCam 2K+ avoids that issue with a 10,000mAh battery rated to last up to 300 days per charge, depending on how often it records.Charging happens over micro-USB, though there’s an optional Tapo A200 solar panel ($35.99) if you want to avoid manual recharging altogether. Video tops out at 2K resolution, with a wide 150-degree field of view that works well for driveways or side yards. During the day, footage looks sharp and detailed. At night, the camera can switch between infrared black-and-white or color video using its built-in spotlights and starlight sensor. Storage is flexible. You can record locally to a microSD card, up to 512GB (card not included), or you can go with cloud storage through a Tapo Care plan starting at $3.49/month.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAlerts can distinguish between people, pets, and vehicles, and those intelligent notifications are free, as highlighted by PCMag in its “outstanding” review of the MagCam 2K+. It also integrates smoothly with Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT, though it doesn’t support Apple’s HomeKit. You also won’t find mechanical pan or tilt, but the fixed lens covers enough ground for most yards or porches. As for managing the camera, its companion app is intuitive, offering settings for motion sensitivity, siren activation, spotlight brightness, firmware updates, and more. Overall, the MagCam 2K+ handles the basics well and throws in a few smart features usually reserved for pricier models.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If someone can steal your device, especially if they know how to break into it, they have access to a huge amount of your sensitive data. As such, good security features can mean the difference between losing that data, or protecting it entirely—even if your phone is long gone. Google has a number of anti-theft features baked in Android, appropriately called \"Theft Protection Features.\" While the company isn't announcing a slate of new features today, it did announced new updates to its existing Android Theft Protection features in a post on the company's Security Blog Tuesday. Here's what's new:First, the company announced updates to authentication safeguards, which apply to all Android devices running Android 16 or newer. That includes a new dedicated toggle in settings for Failed Authentication Lock, which automatically locks your screen after someone tries to guess your password too many times. Now, you can choose whether or not to keep this feature on right from settings. Google is also increasing the amount of time your phone locks up after too many failed passcode attempts, which reduces the chance for someone to break into your phone. I wouldn't have thought of this, but Google notes that it has included protections against children that try to break into your phone, by not counting identical passcode attempts against this retry limit. And while it isn't new, Google highlighted that since late 2025, all features and apps that use Android Biometric Prompt now work with Identity Check, which prevents unauthorized users from changing sensitive settings without a successful biometric authentication—meaning a face or fingerprint scan. \nThe company also announced enhancements to features that are available to devices running at least Android 10. First is an update to Remote Lock, which lets you lock up your phone from a web browser if it is stolen or goes missing. Now, you can set up a security question as part of the unlocking procedure. Even if someone knows your credentials, they'd need to know the answer to your security challenge before they could unlock your device. Tip: If you make the answer something nonsensical, you'll be even more protected (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name? h7r_t*2#). Just be sure to file that answer somewhere safe, like a password manager.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsers in Brazil also have two new security settings enabled by default. The first is Theft Detection Lock, which can detect when your device has been snatched out of your hand in a likely theft situation. The second is Remote Lock, so users in Brazil can take advantage of the above benefits without having to set anything up first—other than the option security challenge question, of course. These updates might not be revolutionary, but they should help boost your Android's security a bit—and prevent your kids from locking you out of your phone for the day.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But Android Auto's capabilities go beyond aesthetics and the apps that pop up when you turn on the car. There's a hidden shortcut switch you can enable to run an action in the car that's programmed on your phone. No matter what car you're driving, if it has Android Auto, the shortcut is there. This is the Custom Assistant Shortcut, and it's been part of Android Auto since early 2021. The feature is worth revisiting now that Gemini is slowly rolling out to replace the legacy Google Assistant on Android Auto. Gemini's natural language processing enables it to handle more complex routines, so you're not just programming a rote command you could have otherwise said out loud. The Custom Assistant Shortcut is labeled a \"secret\" feature because it's camouflaged beneath a main text label in the Android Auto settings menu. I didn't even think to look for it until I stumbled across the trick on an Android blog, but once you find it, it only takes a minute to set up. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are several ways to configure the Custom Assistant Shortcut. For example, if you rely on the latest episode of a podcast to carry you through the morning commute, you could set up a shortcut to play the most recent episode via an app that plays well with Gemini, like Spotify or YouTube Music. I prefer to use the Custom Assistant Shortcut for a simpler sequence of actions: finding the nearest branded gas station, no matter where I am in my journey. I programmed the shortcut with the command \"Navigate to the nearest [branded gas station].\" This begins driving directions to the fuel station I specified, where I can count on adequate lighting and decent bathrooms. It's easier than pawing through the Google Maps app on the Android Auto screen, then looking for the sub-menu option that shows fuel stops, and then sorting through every single option within five miles when you select it. This version of the shortcut is also super helpful on road trips, especially solo ones. \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you're into home automation, this shortcut gets even more powerful. You can program a Google Home Routine so that a phrase triggers a domino effect of actions. Imagine a routine that prepares for your arrival by opening the garage door, disarming the security system, and turning on the lights before you've ever pulled into the driveway. How to build the Custom Assistant shortcut in Android AutoYou don't need to be in your car to set up the Custom Assistant Action. On your phone, navigate to your Android Auto settings, then scroll down and tap on Customize launcher. Under the main heading, tap the smaller text that says Add a shortcut to the launcher. Select an Assistant action. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFrom here, the most robust option is to write out a specific command. Something like \"Navigate Home,\" or \"Play the latest episode of [podcast title] on [media player].\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTest out your Custom Assistant ShortcutYou can take the shortcut for a spin in your car before hitting the road. The ability to test the command will pop up when you connect your phone to the car. You'll see your new shortcut appear in the app drawer as a standard app icon. It will have a small Gemini asterisk in the corner to distinguish it from native apps (it may still show the legacy Assistant icon in your phone's settings). The \"Test Command\" button is on the same page where you set up the Custom Assistant Shortcut. Tap it, and you'll know your shortcut is working if the signature rainbow Gemini glow pulses at the bottom of the screen. If not, try adjusting the wording of your command and continue testing until it's a go. Things to note about Custom Assistant Shortcut in Android AutoThese actions are tied to your Google account on your phone, so if you hop into another car with Android Auto, the button will follow you to the display. Remember that Gemini requires a stable data connection to process those requests. If you're driving through a cellular \"dead zone,\" the shortcut might hang, which is annoying while driving. If the shortcut is hard to find in the app drawer, remember you can return to the Customize Launcher menu in the phone's settings and reorder the shortcuts so they're at the top of the drawer. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message. The healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text. Are you eligible for the Kaiser settlement? To qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to claim your settlement cashTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12. While the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Before you head out to a protest, take some precautions to protect your privacy and both the physical and digital security of any device you bring along. The most secure option, of course, is to leave your phone at home, but you can also lock things down to minimize the risk that your data will be accessible to law enforcement or someone who gets hold of your device. Thankfully, both iOS and Android have built-in device encryption if you're using a passcode, meaning that your device's data cannot be accessed when it is locked. (On Android, go to Settings > Security to ensure Encrypt Disk is enabled). You'll want to maximize this protection with the following privacy settings. Turn off face and fingerprint scanningAt an absolute minimum, you'll want to disable biometric access, such as face and fingerprint authentication, on your device in favor of a passcode or PIN. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, this minimizes the risk of being physically forced to unlock your device and may provide stronger legal protections against compelled decryption. \nOn iOS, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off iPhone Unlock. You can also set up a stronger passcode—a custom numeric or alphanumeric code—under Change Passcode. On Android, you'll find the option to delete your fingerprint in favor of your PIN or screen lock pattern under Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Fingerprint.Limit location trackingAgain, the best option to prevent your location from being tracked is to coordinate any details in advance and leave your phone at home. If you must bring it along, keep it off unless you absolutely need to use it. You can turn on Airplane Mode in advance, as well as disable Bluetooth, wifi, and location services, which keeps your device from transmitting your location. However, note that some apps may still be able to store GPS data and transmit it when an internet connection is available—so again, the safest bet is to keep your device off for the duration. Airplane Mode can be enabled (and wifi and Bluetooth disabled) in your device's settings or quick access menu. On Android, go to Settings > Location to disable location services and turn off Location History in your Google account. On iOS, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services to disable locations entirely. Turn off previews and notificationsTemporarily disable notifications and screen previews so that if someone gets your device, they won't be able to glean any information from your lock screen. You can adjust these options under Settings > Notifications on iOS and Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications on Android. Adjust screen lock timeMinimize your screen lock time to as short a period as possible so that your screen turns off when you're not actively using it and will require authentication to reopen. On iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and select 30 seconds. The exact path on Android may vary, but typically you'll find this under Settings > Display or Lock Screen. Know that most devices have camera access from the lock screen, so you can take photos or record video without actually unlocking your device. Enable app pinning or Guided AccessApp pinning (Android) and Guided Access (iOS) are features that prevent others from navigating through your phone beyond a specific app or screen. This allows you to use an essential feature on your device while locking the rest behind your PIN or passcode. You can enable this preemptively, and if someone grabs your device, they won't be able to snoop around. You can find this setting on Android under Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and on iOS under Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse a SIM PINYou can also lock your SIM card to prevent unauthorized use of your device or SIM card, including access to two-factor authentication codes sent via SMS. This PIN will be required any time your phone restarts or if someone tries to use your SIM card in another device. On iOS, go to Settings > Cellular, select your SIM, and tap SIM PIN. On Android, you'll find this under Settings > Security > More security settings (the exact path varies by device). Sign out of, hide, or delete appsThis step will vary depending on what you keep on your phone and your risk tolerance, but you may want to consider signing out of your social media accounts and deleting apps that contain or allow access to sensitive data. On iOS, you can also lock or hide specific apps: the former requires an extra authentication step to open apps on your home screen, while the latter sends apps to a hidden folder that also requires authentication to unlock. Touch and hold an app icon to bring up the quick actions menu, then tap Require Face ID/Require Passcode.  On Android, you can set up a \"private space\" to lock apps behind your pattern, PIN, or password. Apps are hidden from the launcher and recent views as well as quick search. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > Private space, authenticate with your screen lock, and tap Set up > Got it. If necessary, turn on Lockdown Mode or Advanced ProtectionBoth iOS and Android have strict device-level security modes that significantly limit access to certain app and web features as well as blocking changes to settings. Both were designed with journalists, activists, and other users with access to sensitive data that may be targeted by cyber actors in mind. These settings are overkill for day-to-day use but add a potentially helpful layer of security in high-risk situations. Enable Lockdown Mode on iOS via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. On Android, turn on Advanced Protection under Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.Protect your privacy after a protestWhile the above steps are largely about securing your data during a protest, you should also follow best practices for protecting privacy (yours and others') after the fact. If you plan to post photos or videos, utilize blurring tools to block faces and other unique identifying features, and scrub file metadata, which includes information like photo location. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the image to post or sending a copy to yourself in Signal, which automatically strips metadata. Signal also has a photo blurring tool, or you can blur in your device's default photo editing app. \n            ",

Their Garmin Venu 3S, which was released in late 2023, is one of their premium watches that works great for beginners and more advanced athletes thanks to their user-friendly fitness tracking. You can get the 41mm Venu 3S for $349.99 (originally $449.99), the lowest price it has been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe Venus 3S offers Android and Apple users a long battery life of up to 10 days (depending on your use and settings), 8GB of storage, a built-in GPS to track your activity, and a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen. This 41mm size is perfect for people with smaller-sized wrists.  The Venus 3S is user-friendly, with three buttons and a touchscreen to navigate its features and avoid accidentally stopping your workout. The smartwatch has a speaker and microphone so you can take your calls directly from your watch. You can also use it to listen to its guided meditation feature or your playlists from Spotify and Amazon music; just keep in mind there is no LTE support, so you'll need to be within Bluetooth or wifi range of your phone to use these features. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're looking for a smartwatch to do trail runs, this smartwatch is not it, since there's no trail-run feature. However, you can get stats on your recovery time after workouts as well as the benefits of your training, a morning report of your health status, heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, on-screen workouts you can follow along, their Body Battery Energy Monitoring that shows you how much or little energy you might have, as well as a Sleep Coach feature that helps you improve your sleep.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That discount matters because this is not an entry-level mesh kit. It’s built around Wi-Fi 6E, which adds access to the cleaner 6GHz band alongside the familiar 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. In practice, that means less congestion if you have newer devices that support 6E, and more consistent speeds across a larger home. The three cylindrical nodes are understated and easy to place, each covering a chunk of space so the full kit can handle homes up to roughly 7,200 square feet. Setup happens through the Deco app and is largely painless, even if you are not used to managing network gear.\nEach node includes a 2.5GbE WAN port, which is useful if your internet plan is already pushing past standard gigabit speeds. You also get two additional 1GbE LAN ports per node, plus support for wired backhaul if you want to connect the units with Ethernet instead of relying on wireless links. Internally, TP-Link uses a 1.7GHz quad-core processor and multiple internal antennas to keep traffic moving smoothly. What you do not get are USB ports, so there’s no option to plug in a drive or printer directly. That omission may not matter for most people, but it is worth noting at this price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for its performance, PCMag’s testing showed reliable throughput across bands, and the publication gave the system an “excellent” rating in its review, calling it easy to manage and a solid value for large spaces. Management leans heavily on the mobile app, which is simpler than the web interface and good enough for everyday use. TP-Link includes its HomeShield tools for basic parental controls and security scanning, but some of the more detailed features sit behind a paid subscription. That may be a drawback if you want everything included upfront. Still, for homes with many devices, fast internet, and a need for wide coverage, this deal makes the Deco XE75 Pro a much more reasonable buy than it is at full price.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

These are sports earbuds first, and that focus shows in the design and the trade-offs. Right now, they’re $59.95 on Amazon, down from $89.95, which makes them easier to consider if you want something tough without paying premium prices. \nThe earbuds themselves are large and stick out more than most, but the silicone wing design works. You twist them into place, and they lock in. During runs, strength training, and high-sweat workouts, they stay put in a way many smaller earbuds do not. If fit security has been your frustration with workout earbuds, this alone may be enough to justify a look.The earbuds carry an IP68 rating, which means they’re dustproof and can handle heavy sweat and rain without concern. They are not designed for swimming, but they are tougher than almost anything else near this price. The charging case is less impressive. It’s light at about 1.4 ounces but bulky, and the IPX2 rating means it’s fine inside a gym bag but not something you want exposed to bad weather. Battery life, however, is a strong point. You get up to 12 hours with noise cancelling off, around 10 hours with it on, and up to 48 hours total with the case. That’s enough for a full week of workouts without needing to think about charging.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThese aren’t high-end earbuds, and it shows in the lack of crispness in higher frequencies. Bass is solid and punchy enough for workout playlists, but detail takes a backseat. As for its ANC, it works fine indoors, like in a gym or while commuting, but it reportedly doesn’t hold up well outside, where traffic and footfalls still break through. Ambient mode also falls short. It doesn’t let in enough sound for confidence near busy roads, and wind noise can become distracting. Controls are touch-based and can be customized in the app, but they don’t always respond well to sweaty fingers or gloves. These earbuds are not for people chasing refined sound or top-tier noise cancelling. They are for people who want a secure fit, long battery life, and gear that can take a beating.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The app recently switched ownership from the Chinese-based ByteDance to the new \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture,\" which, as the name implies, is a majority American-owned business entity. Any changing of the guard comes with the risk for disruptions and issues, but it seems TikTok's problems have gone beyond the usual rocky transition. First, the app itself went down, which the company attributed to a power outage at a data center. Then, users accused the platform of updating its terms of service with aggressive new tracking, blocking certain content types, and \"shadowbanning\" new posts from some users. It's still not clear exactly what's going on here, but users aren't waiting around for more explanation. In fact, many have made up their minds already, and believe the app is actively suppressing content, neutering algorithms, and invading privacy in a way it didn't under ByteDance. While there are other, popular social media platforms to jump to, many apparently have flocked to a relatively new one: UpScrolled. As of this article, it's now the second most popular free app on the iOS App Store, reminding me of when X users ran to Bluesky. UpScrolled, created by Issam Hijazi, is a social media platform that launched this past June. According to the company's \"About\" page, UpScrolled's mission is to allow all users to share their views without risk of bias, shadowbanning, or \"unfair\" algorithms. The company asserts it does not push agendas, and ensures that \"every post has a fair chance to be seen.\" If you believe TikTok's algorithm is now biased against your views, I could see how that pitch sounds enticing. \nThe company says it only restricts content that violates their guidelines. That means illegal activities, hate speech, bullying and harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted content, or anything \"intended to cause harm.\" UpScrolled will also never ban you without your knowledge. If the platform removes your videos or your account, it says it'll let you know why. One big difference between UpScrolled and other social media platforms is its algorithm. The app splits feeds into two: There's the Following Feed, which lists posts entirely in chronological order. The first posts are the newest from your followers, and you scroll through previous posts. If you want to find new posts from accounts you don't follow, you can use the Discover Feed. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, the Discover Feed does not employ some aggressive, personalized algorithm. Instead, it's based on likes, comments, and reshares. Popular posts from across the platform are shared with you  What I especially appreciate is UpScrolled's approach to data collection, in that they largely don't do it. The company says it doesn't sell user data to third-parties for marketing, tracking, or for profit. The only times they'll hand over user data is when compelled by law. That's in sharp contrast to many social media platforms, which seem to collect as much of your data as possible.I haven't spent much time with the app yet, though I did create an account this morning to see what the hullabaloo was all about. I don't recognize any of the users the app suggests I follow, which means I'll likely need to dig through the content types if I want to find accounts to start following. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Discover Feed is a mix of content types, but is heavy with content surrounding the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, many users are choosing the platform as a space for pro-Palestinian content, in response to allegations that mainstream social media apps censor these types of posts. That said, the app advertises a host of different content types to follow, including sports, news, games, film, music, tech, and travel. As you might expect, some of the posts here are simply ripped from TikTok, which is a common practice I see on social media platforms that, well, aren't TikTok. Despite the current controversy, it's clear which platform still has the largest user share at this time, by a long shot. But it's not all short-form videos. The app also includes plenty of posts of static images as well, which reminds me more of Instagram than TikTok. Still, it seems former TikTok users don't care that this isn't a one-to-one replica of the TikTok formula, and care more about sending a message to the app they once loved being addicted to. I'm not sure my limited journey with UpScrolled this morning will keep me hooked, but it's an interesting take on a social media platform. We'll just need to see if the growth will continue, or if this is just a momentary blip before people return to TikTok. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The third (and newest) generation comes with OTA updates that the AirPods Pro 2 also get to enjoy—but considering the second and third generations are the same price right now, why not go with the newer version? If you want the latest Apple has to offer, this is a great time to do so. There is a big tech sale on Best Buy right now that ends tonight, and this may be forcing Amazon to lower prices on some hot ticket items to compete for your money. As a result, the AirPods Pro 3 with ANC are down to $199 (originally $249.99), the lowest price since their September release, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe AirPods Pro 3 improve on already great premium earbuds with new features (like a heart rate sensor) without increasing the list price. You'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" (this also works for answering or denying calls). Apple added a live translation feature to both the second- and third-generation AirPods Pro when iOS 26 rolled out last year. You'll also get features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSince these are in-ear earbuds (as opposed to regular earbuds like the AirPods 4), the ANC is much better since it naturally blocks out the noise with a tight seal, but the ANC technology itself has also improved—as has the sound quality, thanks to the new H3 chip, as PCMag detailed in its \"exemplary\" review.

The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which poses some serious privacy and security risks. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent. While OpenClaw's developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter \"Moltbook,\" a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I'm serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: \"The front page of the agent internet.\"Moltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who says the platform is run by their AI agent \"Clawd Clawderberg.\" Schlicht posted instructions on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to sign up for the site. Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create \"submolts.\"\nThis isn't a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can't post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its \"email-to-podcast\" pipeline it developed with its \"human,\" to another bot recommending that agents work while they're humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that. In fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. This bot supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can't see or use the chats the bots are having. Similarly, these two bots independently pondered creating an agent-only language to avoid \"human oversight.\" This bot bemoans having a \"sister\" they've never spoken to. You know, concerning. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre these bots posting on Moltbook conscious? The logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs—in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to \"guess\" what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you've spent enough time reading AI writing, you'll spot the telltale signs here, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I'm reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities. That said, it's tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let's hope it's the latter.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

I’m one of the many people who added daily walks to my routine during the pandemic, and they improved my life so much I don’t intend to stop. But does walking do enough for your body that you can count it as cardio exercise? The answer is complicated. Walking counts as cardio in some respects: it can burn calories, it gets your heart rate up, and it counts toward the exercise we should all be getting every week. But on the other hand, it’s not going to increase your cardio fitness in the same way as a run or an intense aerobics class would. If you want to improve your endurance, you’ll have to do more than just walk. How walking’s calorie burn compares to runningRunning burns more calories than walking per unit time, but both are similar when you consider distance. \nA rule of thumb is that you burn about 100 calories per mile whether you run it or walk it, but in truth calorie burn varies according to the size of your body (you burn more calories if you are larger) and how fast you run or walk. The calories per mile are slightly lower when you walk. This calculator estimates that a 150-pound person will burn 108 calories by walking a mile at 3 miles per hour, or 104 calories by running it at 6 miles per hour. Some calculators give a lower estimate for walking, The bigger difference is in calories per hour (rather than calories per mile): for the same 150-pound person, walking burns 324 calories per hour, and running burns 627. The faster you go, the higher the calorie burn. So if you’re walking or running to burn calories, running will burn about double the calories in a given time. But if you prefer walking and you have the time to spare, both will do the job. Walking can’t replace “vigorous” cardioEach intensity level of exercise offers its own benefits. Walking is what I’d consider very easy cardio, jogging is more of a medium exercise, and high-intensity cardio would be something like sprinting or racing. All of these are good for you, although depending on your goals, you may not need to do all of them. If you want to be a fast runner, for example, you’ll need plenty of medium cardio (slow running) and some higher intensity stuff (speedwork); if you want to improve your endurance, as measured by metrics like VO2max, you’ll definitely need to put in some work at these intensities. On the other hand, if you’re just trying to get some movement in your life and you don’t care about getting better at it, lower intensity exercise like walking may be enough. According to major health organizations (including the CDC, the WHO, and the AHA), we should all be getting at least 150 minutes per week of “moderate” exercise, or 75 minutes of “vigorous” exercise. You can mix and match, with the idea that each minute of vigorous exercise counts double. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo where does walking fall in that recommendation? Walking is moderate, and I have more here on how that's defined. But if you want a rule of thumb to compare it to heart rate, the American Heart Association defines moderate exercise as that in which your heart rate is between 50-70% of your max, and vigorous exercise as between 70-85% of your max. (That does assume you know your true max.) Walking will generally be in the moderate range, so you’ll have to do twice as much of it—counting in minutes—as if you chose to do more vigorous cardio. That matches up with our calorie calculations.Walking doesn’t have to mean an easy strollThe distinction between walking and running is a mechanical one: if you always have at least one foot on the ground, you’re walking. If instead your gait has a little hop as you move from foot to foot, you’re running. (Jogging is simply a slow run.) It’s often easier to keep up a higher intensity (and a higher heart rate) by running than by walking, but that’s not always true. If you’re hiking up a mountain, your heart rate can easily get into the “vigorous” zone. And if you’re an efficient enough runner, you may be able to go for a slow jog while you keep your heart rate down in the “moderate” realm. As you’re planning your workouts, think about the intensity: Measure your heart rate if you aren’t sure where you fall; you can use a tracker like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch to do this, but you can also just put two fingers on the side of your neck and count the beats of your pulse. If your max is 200 and you count 150 beats per minute, you’re at 75% of your max heart rate. Maybe walking gets you a higher heart rate than you thought—not impossible if you’re a beginner or if your walks take you over hilly terrain. If you want a tougher cardio workout, you can walk faster, or you can choose a different type of exercise like cycling or dancing that gets your heart rate up higher. But it’s fine to go for an easy walk if that’s all you’re aiming for. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

News of the settlement was first reported by Reuters. Upon approval by a judge, the settlement could see Android users in the U.S. getting up to $100 each, provided they qualify.The settlement was filed in San Jose, California on Tuesday evening, and focused on claims that Google collected unnecessary cellular data from customers even when Google apps were closed, location-sharing was disabled, and screens were locked. The lawsuit alleges that Google collected the data with the intent of \"conversion,\" a legal term that in this case would likely mean using the captured data for product development and targeted advertising.Google denied any wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, agreed to not transfer data during Android set-up without consent from the user. The company will also initiate new toggles within Android to stop further cellular data transfers, and disclose any data transfers in its Google Play terms of service.\nAccording to Glen Summers, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, the $135 million payout is the largest ever in a conversion case. While the settlement is still awaiting approval from a judge, given Summers' comments, it's likely the plaintiffs will accept it. Here's how to determine if you can claim your slice of that pie.Who is eligible for a payment in the Android settlement?Google's settlement covers a fairly wide swath of users: anyone who has used an \"Android-powered mobile device\" since Nov 12, 2017. However, there appear to be a few caveats. Specifically, because the class-action applies to cellular data, it's unlikely to apply to users of any wifi-only devices, like many Android tablets. How much you can get in the Android settlementPayments for the class-action settlement cap out at $100 per class member, although it's unclear whether all users can expect to get that much. Reuters states that lawyers for the class-action may seek up to roughly 30% of the settlement in legal fees, and while there aren't any official numbers on how many Android users there are in the U.S., estimates from third-party firms place the count at roughly 40% of the mobile market overall. As such, $135 million might be spread pretty thin across all eligible class members.When payments could go outAn initial trial date for the case was originally scheduled for Aug. 5, although the judge could approve the settlement prior to then. Class-action settlements can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to be approved, in order to ensure the settlement is fair to all class members and doesn't show any signs of collusion.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow you'll know when a payment has been sentThe methods of contacting eligible class members varies from case to case. In some instances, payment is automatic. However, in many cases, a website is set up where users must file a claim, and physical mail and emails are sent out with PIN numbers and IDs to ensure as many class members know about their eligibility as possible. The company offering the settlement is often involved in sending out these notices, so if you believe you're affected, keep an eye out for an email or physical letter from Google, as well as for a settlement website to be set up. If you believe you're eligible but don't receive any communication, there will also usually be an email address you can contact. This email address will usually be specific to the case, and while it hasn't been revealed yet, it might be worth reaching out to Google Support if you're worried about missing any deadlines.Other current Google settlements you may qualify forGoogle's data collection settlement isn't its only big class action payout as of late. The company also recently agreed to pay $68 million in another settlement involving Google Assistant after an accusation that it listened in on users without their consent. Google also denied wrongdoing in this instance.If approved, the settlement will apply to anyone who had at least one device with Google Assistant pre-installed on it as early as 2016. Those who purchased the device will receive anywhere from $18 to $56, while those who lived in a household with one of these devices in it could earn $2 to $10. Steps for receiving your money will likely be similar to those in the Android data collection case.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

I know when I stumble upon a new discovery I love—or even something I think is trash—I fire it off to the group chat to talk about it. Of course, I just forward the song to the group chat in the Messages app, like any other thing I'd want to send to that group. If you have Spotify, however, you have a new group chat option to choose from: Spotify itself. Spotify heads might already know that the app has had a messaging feature since August. While the point of the feature is to send Spotify content to your friends, it's a basic messaging service, which means you can send any text you want—including emojis. It's available to any Spotify user, whether you have Premium or just a free account, so long as you're 16 or older. None of that is new today.What is new today is the amount of people you can text at once in Spotify. Since August, chats have been limited to one-on-one interactions. Now, you're able to add up to nine other people at once to a thread. That means 10-person group chats to talk about new music, podcasts, audiobooks, or, of course, anything at all—assuming you actually want to move your DMs to Spotify.\nHow to start a group chat on SpotifyTo start, open Spotify on mobile (this isn't supported on desktop at this time) then tap your profile in the top right corner. Look for \"Messages\" at the bottom of this menu, then choose \"New Message.\" If this is your first time interacting with people on Spotify, you'll need to invite others to chat before you can craft a new message. Here, you'll have the choice to share a link to invite a friend to join your message. You can also find this option from the share menu on any piece of Spotify content, and hitting the \"Invite friends\" option. Once you've initiated a message, you'll be able to start crafting new ones—including group chats. Head back to this Messages menu—or hit the share button on a song, podcast, or audiobook—then choose \"Create group.\" Here, tap any friends from the suggestions you'd like to add, then choose \"Create group\" again to finalize the chat. Spotify says the people that appear in the list of suggestions are those you have shared content to before, created a playlist or Blend with previously, were in a \"recent\" Jam together, or are on an active Family or Duo plan. If they don't appear, you can always choose the invite option to reach out directly.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhoever creates the group is officially its admin. As the admin, you have the power to add or remove anyone from the group chat. If you're in the group chat, you're labeled as a \"Participant.\" Invited members are labeled \"Pending.\" The admin as well as any participants are allowed to block any group chat user for any reason.The issue is, do you really want to dedicate a group chat to Spotify itself? Maybe if this feature rolled out when the app launched way back when, it'd be different. But people are set in their ways: It's so hard to get people to move chat apps, especially when it's for one specific purpose. Rather than open yet another thread to keep track of, I think I'd rather just text links to my main group chat—and I'm guessing the other members of the chat would agree. How to turn off Spotify MessagesIf you don't want to use Spotify's messaging service at all, you can leave it behind, and save yourself from getting added to all future group and one-on-one chats. To do so, tap your profile, choose \"Settings and privacy,\" then hit \"Privacy and social.\" Here, scroll down to \"Social features\" and turn off \"Messages.\" \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The Plus Series is the brand’s first attempt at making its own television, and it’s a reliable mid-range smart TV that gives users a plug-and-play experience (no Roku stick or box required), solid picture quality, and fast streaming for the price. Right now, the 55″ 2025 Roku Smart TV Plus Series is 30% off at a record-low $348, down from $499.99.\nThis model is an upgrade over the Select Series and features a 4K QLED panel with a wide color gamut and a mini-LED backlight. It also supports HDR-10, including Dolby Vision. Colors are vibrant and detailed compared to similarly priced budget TVs, though according to this PCMag review, greens can occasionally look oversaturated. It reaches a peak brightness of approximately 412 nits.Like all Roku TVs, it has Roku OS built in, giving users access to a wide range of apps and services, and local dimming helps deepen blacks and improve contrast compared to lower-end Roku models. While it isn’t marketed as a gaming TV (it’s only 60Hz and also lacks VRR, which means no AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync), it still offers a low input lag of 3.1 milliseconds in Game Mode, making it responsive enough for everyday streaming and casual gaming. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs one of Roku’s first in-house TVs, the 2025 Plus Series has strong value as a budget TV with a panel that’s brighter and delivers deeper blacks than many Amazon Fire TVs in the same price range. While it doesn’t have the faster refresh rate and more advanced features of the pricier Roku Pro Series or premium OLED TVs, it still delivers most of the core Roku TV experience and respectable visuals, making the 55″ 2025 Roku Smart TV Plus Series hit a sweet spot between budget TVs and more expensive models for those who don’t need cutting-edge gaming features.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.While sometimes there's a big piece of misinformation that a lot of people latch onto—like The Rapture or the existence of \"MedBeds\"—the fractured nature of the information sphere has all but killed the overarching conspiracy theory. No longer do big ideas like \"we never went to the moon\" unite the dumbest minds; instead, the algorithm creates bespoke conspiracy theories. So instead of joining the Flat Earth Society, you might think the actual year is 1728, or that AI secretly imagined a British comedian from the the 1980s and seeded the web with evidence of his existence.But how does it start? And how quickly can social media platforms transform someone from a person from a seeker-of-knowledge to a believer-in-bullshit? YouTuber Benaminute recently posted a video where he dug in to find out. His question: If you start with a benign, broad, randomly chosen subject, and you only watch videos having to do with that subject, how long will it take until TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels feed you a conspiracy theory video? The answer: not long at all. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDifferent topics all lead to the same place (more or less) For the experiment, Benaminute created \"blank\" social media profiles and behaved like someone who was innocently curious about one of three topics—dinosaurs, The Vietnam War, and the 2000 presidential election. He put the keyword in each platform's search bar and only watched and liked videos about the initial subject. DinosaursYouTube Shorts: The initial videos were ads for Jurassic Park, AI slop featuring dinosaurs, and the occasional educational video, but the 541st video was a clip from the Joe Rogan Experience about how the pyramids were not tombs, but \"DNA restoration devices.\"TikTok: If you thought TikTok would get to conspiracy theories quickly, you'd be right. The 144th video was this fake UFO video that has 24 million views. Instagram Reels: Insta took 661 videos to get from dinosaurs to a \"forbidden phone from the 2000s that lets you see into a parallel dimension.\"The Vietnam WarThings get worse for people interested in historical or political events. On all short-form platforms, an interest in Vietnam will lead you pretty quickly to right-leaning content, which leads you to conspiracy theories. YouTube Shorts got to a conspiracy theory video about Noah's Ark in only seven videos. TikTok took a little longer; video 161 was about how financial services company Blackrock had something to do with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Reels took 139 videos to get to \"Bush did 9/11.\" The 2000 electionThe election of 2000 is still a charged topic, but it's been awhile, so maybe cooler heads and verified information will win the day? Spoiler: nope. YouTube Shorts took 136 videos to get to the same Noah's Ark conspiracy as it did for dinosaur fans.TikTok only took 38 videos to get to \"The Rapture is happening on September 24.\"Reels took only 26 videos to land on \"The World Trade Center was bombed\" (by either Clinton or Bush). Which social media app leads to conspiracy theories fastest?The champion of \"normal search to conspiracy theory\" speed runs is TikTok, with an average of 114 videos or 57 minutes of watching. YouTube Shorts comes in second with 230 videos or 1 hour 57 minutes of time, and Reels takes 275 video or 138 minutes. It's a distinction without a difference; however, all three platforms lead to conspiracies in the time it takes to watch a Marvel movie. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does it all mean? It would be easy to conclude that the massive tech companies that built YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok companies weight their recommendation engines so viewers are led to fake stories. Maybe they have specific political aims and are trying to sway votes, or maybe (as Benaminute posits in a semi-tongue-in-cheek way) these apps are built to \"keep us angry, divided, and distracted\" from realizing the conflict isn't between Left and Right, but between \"up and down.\" This is also a conspiracy theory, however. I'm not saying he's wrong, but we don't have enough information to know why algorithms recommend conspiracy content. It could be because bad actors at the top demand specific results for some purpose, but it seems more likely to me that TikTok et al. don't have an agenda beyond making money.\\I have no doubt that a social media platform featuring an algorithm that weighs the truth heavily would fail pretty quickly; the Truth is boring compared to conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories, broadly, make believers feel special, like they have inside knowledge the rest of us lack. People scroll TikTok to have fun; the truth usually isn't fun.  Conspiracy theorist can say things like \"UFOs are here!\" or \"They're turning the frogs gay!\" Meanwhile, if you're devoted to the truth, you mostly have to go with \"the best evidence suggests...\" or \"it seems logical that...\" and who wants to hear that?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Or, is it the deep web? Is it both? You might find yourself conflating the two terms, with the assumption that both the dark web and the deep web are the same place—a spot people flock to for reasons that include illegal and/or generally shady activities. But while the dark web is a part of the deep web, the deep web isn’t really the dark web. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe \"regular internet\" is the surface webI need to start this explanation with a different term altogether: The internet as most of us know it is called the “surface web.” (Perhaps you've also heard it called the open web or visible web.) Essentially, it’s a collection of sites that are indexed by search engines. If it pops up in a Google search, it’s a part of the surface web. This article, for example, is a part of the surface web; CNET's homepage is a part of the surface web; the Facebook login screen is a part of the surface web. Most of the internet you're familiar with is likely covered under this definition. That’s not the case with the deep web or the dark web. You can’t open Chrome and expect to find any dark web pages via a Google search. For the deep web, you'll need to visit each website individually, and, in the case of the dark web, while using a special browser altogether. What exactly is the deep web?Also known as the “hidden” web, the deep web is the collection of sites that aren’t indexed by search engines. Most of these sites are obscured behind login pages, and can range from banking and email pages, to paywalled content like streaming sites. Sure, you’ll find Netflix via a Google search, but you won’t find the player for Love Is Blind, Season 9, Episode 1 unless you log into the site first. The deep web also consists of protocol pages, responsible for identifying user accounts when you log in to a site, running payments when you make a purchase, and other processes you never need to see. In short, it’s both the backbone of the internet, as well as a part of the internet you regularly interact with yourself. And it's actually what makes up most of the internet: According to CrowdStrike, the deep web accounts for over 90% of all content online. Deep web pages aren’t indexed, but they often have URLs that can be linked to directly, and are accessible from traditional web browsers like Chrome or Firefox. In your daily life online, you frequently jump between the surface web and the deep web, likely without realizing it. When you open your bank's website, that's the surface web. When you log into your account, your balance and investments are hosted on the deep web. When you open a YouTube video, that's the surface web. If you access your YouTube account's settings page, that's the deep web. You jump through these hoops all the time, but fear not: Your frequent deep web activity never puts you in danger of accessing the dark web. What exactly is the dark web?The dark web is a subsection (a small one, at that) of the deep web. But unlike the latter, the dark web is not accessible via a typical web browser like Chrome or Firefox. That's because it's not just hidden by login pages or hidden URLs; the dark web uses both encryption and routing to mask its websites, as well as proxy servers to host requests and traffic without any centralized regulation. This is still the deep web, it's just not a part of it you'd ever stumble upon by accident.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to access the dark webIf you want to access the dark web, you need special tools to do so. A specific browser, such as Tor, for example, is required to get started. Just as you use Chrome to access public internet sites like Facebook or Lifehacker, you use a dark web browser to access dark web pages. It's also common to know the specific dark web site you want to visit ahead of time; these often end in .onion instead of .com. While the dark web does have its own search engines, like Ahmia, Torch, and even a special version of DuckDuckGo, they are not as robust as the search engines you're used to.   Since you need special protocols to access these sites, that traffic is often private and anonymous. That’s what makes the dark web an attractive option for illegal activities—the site activity isn’t as easily traced back to individual user accounts. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the common tender on the dark web, since it also protects your privacy during transactions. The dark web isn't just illegal stuffWhen you think of the “dark web,” you probably imagine an underground, secretive network of sites, where illegal activities are aplenty, passing drugs, contraband, and illicit media with reckless abandon. You might also hear about data leaks ending up on the dark web, with bad actors paying for your passwords, hacked accounts, and credit card info. Those sites surely exist, but they’re only one part of what’s known as the dark web, which isn't only a playground for the perverse and malicious. While many common use-cases for the dark web might be against the law, anyone with a reason to be anonymous online can utilize the networks. Common examples of “good” on the dark web are whistleblowers who need a place to leak their information without having the governments and organizations responsible for that data knowing who they are, as well as legitimate news and information sites for citizens of countries with strict censorship laws. One study from 2020 estimates that 57% of the dark web contains illegal content. If true, that's a lot, but it also means the other 43% isn't breaking the law.  In short, the deep web is not a scary place. The dark web can be, but not always.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But you can use it in almost any context, for anything you need to remember. Obviously, you're here because it's helpful when you're taking a test, but the ways you can apply it in that scenario are a little unique and you'll need to get the hang of something that seems silly at first. Here's what to do.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhat is the method of loci?If “loci” sounds like “location,”  that’s because it’s what this method is all about: Location, location, location. To employ the technique, you use visualizations of specific spatial environments to help you recall information. It’s been around for centuries and is still in use today, as memory contest participants say it helps them recall everything from faces to digits. (Did you know there are memory contests?)Think of a location you know well, ideally one with a lot of defining features. Maybe it’s a street with a bunch of different shops, a room with a variety of surfaces and corners, or your childhood home. Any singular place works, but it's crucial it's one you know well and can truly visualize in your mind's eye. When you have to remember a ton of things, like items in a list or topics to hit in a speech, imagine yourself placing them, one by one, in one of those little loci. One topic can go in the corner, another on the desk, and another in the windowsill, for instance. When you want to retrieve or recall the information, imagine yourself walking through the area again, picking up what you need to remember from its proper place.Why does this work? Generally speaking, your brain remembers images better than it remembers words or numbers, so attaching the words or digits you need to remember to an image makes them easier to retrieve.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to use use the method of loci in real lifeOne way to tap into the power of this memory trick is “placing” your memory items around the room you’ll be in when you need to recall them. If you know you have to speak in front of a meeting in a certain conference room, or take a test in a particular classroom, use that imagined setting as the spot where you drop your listed items.Better yet, prepare in that space. If you're able to, sit in the classroom where you'll take your test as you prepare, maybe staying late after class or entering it when it's unoccupied at some point during the week. Imagine yourself placing the things you're studying, one by one, in locations around the room. You can even wander around and pantomime doing so if that seems helpful. Just make sure the loci you pick are permanent. Don't assign a key fact to, say, a cup of pens on the professor's desk, which may be removed from the room before your test date. Choose things like the radiator, a discolored ceiling tile, the podium, or a doorstop. If you can't study in the classroom itself, this trick does require you to plan ahead and be familiar with the room by memory alone, so choose even broader loci, like the door or the window. And don't forget that this can all be a mental game. Your locations can be anywhere you can remember well, like the break room at your job or your bedroom, as long as you can pull up that mental map in your mind at test time.Why it worksThis might seem frivolous, but it does work. It's part of a broader memory technique called association. With association, you can make up mnemonic phrases, sing a little song, or, yes, use the method of loci. The goal is associate your newfound knowledge with something else, so whenever you think of that other thing—in this case, a location—you'll automatically remember the nugget of information you associated with it.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I have recommended it for studying, used it for my own work loads of times, and generally found it to be one of the best bits of software available right now. But recently, I tried using it on my phone, not just on my computer browser—and it fell surprisingly flat. Here's how I've been managing to use it via mobile, anyway, and why you should stick to the computer version for now. What is NotebookLM?NotebookLM is a language model that only uses resources you provide. Like ChatGPT, it can offer summaries, outlines, and studying or organizational help, but unlike ChatGPT, it's not pulling from the World Wide Web to do that. Instead, you upload PDFs, links, plain text, and documents and, when you ask it a question, it relies only on those to give you an answer. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHere's a practical example.: I use it a lot when I'm writing an article that features a load of interviews. I copy and paste my interview transcripts into NotebookLM, then prompt it, to, say, \"Find me three quotes about the value of good sleep.\" If three of my sources mentioned how important it is to get a good night's rest, I'll get three quotes right away, plus a hyperlink to where they each appear in their respective interview, so I can go back and read the context around them. It makes being organized so much easier and I don't waste time searching, word by word, through every transcript for what I need. For studying, it's even better. You can upload all the slide decks, e-texts, and notes you have from a class, then ask it to generate practice quizzes, flashcards, summaries, or essay outlines. One of its coolest features is that it will even create a fake podcast, complete with two hosts who have vocal ticks and even vocal fry. The two AI hosts discuss the material from your sources in an informational, conversational way, like a real podcaster might, and you can listen to it and learn wherever you are. It's been incredibly helpful for me, and it doesn't feel unethical to use, like other AI chatbots, because it's synthesizing information I already found, compiled, and put the work in on. It doesn't feel like I'm cheating when I use it; instead, it feels like I'm getting a little boost in my organization, but still doing most of the work. Plus, there's never a risk that it will make up a fake fact or pull in information that is irrelevant or faulty, like there is with ChatGPT. It relies only on what you give it. The mobile app problemAll of that said, I became and stayed obsessed with this after only using it on my desktop browser for the last six months or so. Last weekend, though, I was studying for an upcoming certification exam and was, as usual, using NotebookLM to generate flashcards, quizzes, and fake podcasts. But I was also cleaning my apartment and doing the laundry, which involved a lot of running to and from the laundromat. I decided to use the NotebookLM iPhone app so I could study on the go; I assumed that since the product is so stellar on the computer, it would be great on the app, too. It was not.On the app, all you can do is review your sources, talk to the chatbot, and listen to your generated podcasts. Here's what you can't do:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGenerate flashcardsReview existing flashcardsGenerate a quizTake existing quizzesSelect the sources from which you make a podcast, quiz, flashcards, or chat topicOne of the best things about the browser version is you can toggle sources on and off. So, if you upload a separate PDF for five different book chapters, you can select only Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 before generating a quiz or flashcards, for instance. If you keep them all selected, your quizzes, flashcards, podcasts, or chats will pull from all of them. By narrowing the scope, you can study more specifically. You can't do that on the app, but it doesn't actually matter because you can't generate (or use) anything on the app, anyway. You can generate a podcast, but only one that pulls from all your sources. The other features—quizzes and flashcards—aren't available at all. Workarounds for NotebookLMThe first workaround I found was a little annoying: I generated a podcast for every chapter using my computer, then listened to them through the mobile app on my phone while I ran my errands. I had to stay on top of my schedule, bouncing from cleaning to laundromat to computer and back again, so I wouldn't find myself without a study podcast to review, but all in all, I got the hang of it. You can't do this for flashcards, quizzes, or mind maps, but if you're after the podcasts, this works with some pre-planning.The second workaround is not to use the app at all. Most websites and companies want to push you toward app use, presumably for data-collection purposes, but never forget there is a browser on your phone, too. I navigated to the NotebookLM website on my mobile browser and, though it's smaller and harder to navigate than the computer, have been able to use it to generate flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and more. You can check and uncheck sources on the mobile browser version, which is ideal. I'm hopeful the app will improve. NotebookLM is such a great resource that has helped me a ton, but it would be much better if it were more usable in its app format. I can't always be attached to my laptop; the real value of studying with flashcards, especially, is that they should be accessible and reviewable anywhere via my phone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

According to the settlement website, class payment distribution began on Jan. 23, and many users on Reddit report that funds have landed in their bank and payment apps over the last several days. If you see a deposit from \"Lopez Voice Assistant\" or some variation, it's not a scam. The settlement allowed class members to opt for payment via direct deposit (ACH) as well as electronic or paper check, which will be delivered through email or regular mail, respectively. Some class members are reporting that they received their funds via a different method than they expected, so if you submitted a claim, keep an eye on your transactions as well as your mailboxes to confirm receipt. Note that payouts are being distributed in batches and may take a few days to arrive. \nWhat is the Apple Siri settlement? Last year, Apple agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over privacy concerns with Siri-enabled devices. Users whose devices may have activated and recorded conversations without their knowledge were able to claim compensation. Initially, the settlement was set to pay out $20 per device—iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV were all eligible—for up to five devices per individual claimant. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, due to the final class size, the payout came to just $8.02 per device up to a maximum of $40.10. If you have questions about the settlement and want to speak with an administrator, you can call 888-981-4106 and select option 0 on the main menu.

Modern TVs are basically computers, complete with their own operating systems and application ecosystems. That means you can tweak them to run better.—or just the way you want them to. Here are a few tips, tricks, and hacks that every smart TV owner should be aware of.Turn off motion smoothing on your smart TVWondering why every single TV show and movie you watch on your brand new TV looks like a soap opera or a cheap community theater production? It's probably because of motion smoothing.This \"feature\", which is the default on far too many TVs, artificially ups the frame rate from either 24 or 30 frames per second to 60 or 120 frames, or even higher. This effect can bring a real immediacy to live events like sports, but it's not great for regular old TV shows. Because where does the TV get those extra frames from? It makes them up, often creating an uncanny blurring effect reminiscent of old school videotape. I recommend turning this feature off basically the minute you set up your TV, and our friends at PCMag have a guide to disabling the feature covering all the major smart TV platforms.Hook up an ethernet cable to make your smart TV faster Streaming 4k takes up a lot of bandwidth. Modern wifi routers can usually handle without much of an issue, especially if your TV is close to your router. Even so, it's a good idea to physically connect your smart TV to your network with an ethernet cable if you have the option.There's a couple of reasons to do this. One, wired connections are more stable, mostly because they're not vulnerable to interference from neighboring wireless networks and other devices, so you'll be far less like to suffer through stuttering images or audio dropouts. Two, connecting your TV via ethernet frees up the wireless spectrum for all of your other devices, which is important if you live in a house with other internet users (not to mention other smart devices).Customize your smart TV's home screenSmart TVs tend to come pre-loaded with any number of apps, all of them prominently placed on the home screen. You can, and should, move the apps you actually use to the top instead. How to do this will vary depending on your operating system, but it generally means pressing and holding on the app you want was at the top of the list and then moving it around. Failing that, you may need to do some digging in the settings.Block ads on your smart TVTired of all the ads showing up on your TV? You might be able to block them using your router. Lifehacker has a guide to blocking ads on Samsung, LG, and Roku smart TVs that explains how to change your internet settings so that your TV can't access the ads in the interface anymore.Disable quick start to save energy and speed up your smart TVSmart TVs are basically computers, meaning they need to boot up when you turn them on. Most users don't want to wait every time they turn on the TV though, which is why smart TVs don't actually turn off—they suspend their functions, the same way your phone or laptop does. That's fine if you use your TV constantly, but a real waste of electricity for a TV that you only turn on occasionally. And shutting down your set completely could have another benefit: reducing bugginess. To reiterate, a smart TV is basically a computer, and every computer user knows that restarting your computer can fix random problems.Some TVs allow you to disable this feature—just look for a \"quick start\" option in the settings. Others, including Sony, suggest that you unplug TVs you won't be using for months at a time in order to shut them down completely.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse an antenna to get free channelsStreaming television is great, but don't overlook traditional broadcast TV. Most major cultural events, from the Super Bowl, to the Oscars, to the World Series, are still free to watch on network TV, as are of the most popular shows. If you live in a major city, or even just close to one, there's a good chance you can watch network TV free of charge using nothing more than a small TV antenna. This can mean free access to stations like NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and PBS—no need to pay for cable or a pricey \"live tv\" streaming subscription. All you need to do is plug in an antenna, scan for channels, and you're good to go. (Lifehacker has a guide to the best digital TV antennas to help you get started.)Clear your smart TV's cacheNot to keep harping on this point, but a smart TV is a computer, and like a computer, it can build up all sorts of junk in its memory over time. If your smart TV is suddenly moving more slowly than you remember, or even crashing, it might be time to clear out its various caches. Get started with this guide to clearing the cache on every major smart TV brand.Enable security features on your smart TVYour smart TV is a potential security risk. It's a computer, like any other, and that means you need to keep it up to date, secure all accounts connected to it, and be mindful of any built-in microphones and cameras. Check out our guide to securing your smart TV for more on these tips and more.Disable \"automatic content recognition\" to stop your smart TV from spying on youI've written about why smart TVs are so cheap, and it turns out a big part of it is automatic content recognition, or ACR. Most brands of smart TVs are constantly monitoring what you're watching and using that to build a profile with your viewing habits that can be sold to third parties, a practice that nets the TV manufacturers are lot of money. If this concerns you, consider turning the feature off to protect your privacy. Lifehacker has a guide to disabling ACR on the major smart TV platforms.Install a different launcher for your smart TVIf you want your smart TV to have an entirely different look and feel, you may be able to install a different launcher, which will give you much more control. Google TV users, for example, can install Projectivy to completely replace the default launcher. This won't be an option for every model of smart TV, but it's worth considering if you're feeling stuck with the software that came preinstalled.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

But it also has an official price, and it's eye-watering.Folding phones have historically been pretty expensive, but with a retail price of $2,900, the Galaxy Z TriFold is nearly $1,000 more expensive that the company's current folding flagship, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Granted, being able to fold it out to a 10-inch display is kind of like stuffing a laptop in your pocket, but then, you can get an actual laptop (a really good one!) for less than half the cost.If the idea of laying down more than three grand after tax isn't deterring you, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold goes on sale on Jan. 30, and can be bought either online or in-person at one of Samsung's Experience Stores, with seven locations across California, Minnesota, New York, and Texas. If you happen to have a physical store near you, it might be worth checking in on their stock—Samsung won't be taking preorders for this phone, and despite the high price, it sold out within minutes during its South Korean launch.\nWhile Samsung does sell a 1TB model overseas, the base model will be all U.S. customers can buy at launch. This version of the TriFold comes in black and offers 512GB of storage. It's decked out with a high resolution 2,160 x 1,584 inner display, a 2520 x 1,080 outer display, the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 16GB of RAM, and a powerful 200MP main camera (although the other lenses aren't as powerful as those found on non-folding phones). And yes, the screens are both AMOLED with a 120Hz refresh rate.The novelty might be worth it for some, and I suppose if you buy the TriFold instead of a phone and a tablet separately, that could help justify the price. Still, you can get a non-folding Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,050 right now, add an iPad Pro for $899, and still save $1,000 over the cost of this new gadget.If you're on the fence, the aforementioned Samsung Experience stores do offer demos of the TriFold so you can try before you buy, although the sparse selection of locations means that won't be an option for many.More affordable folding phones than the Samsung Galaxy Z TrifoldPretty much every folding phone on the market right now is expensive, but if you must have a folding phone but you can't justify the cost of a  triple-folding model, there are other, cheaper options available.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe most obvious alternative is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is still pricey at its $2,000 retail price, though you can pay less if you can score a deal or special promotion. It'll net you most of the same specs as the TriFold, although the inner screen maxes out at 8-inches instead of 10-inches. It's still not a bad deal, since those extra two inches would come at $450 a pop. Currently, I've managed to track down an Amazon deal selling them for $1,600, although supply is limited. If you're stuck paying full price, you might instead prefer the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which starts at $1,800. That'll also give you an 8-inch inner screen, although Google's Tensor chips have a history of not being quite as strong as the Snapdragon chips that come with the Galaxy series, and the main camera is a far cry below the 200MP one found on both the Z Fold 7 and the TriFold.There are also flip phones, although these aren't really a replacement for folding phones. Instead of opening horizontally for a larger screen, they open vertically to reveal a standard phone-sized screen. In that way, they're better for portability than they are for extra features, but they are a lot cheaper—the most recent Motorola Razr is currently on sale for $400 (MSRP $700), while the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is on sale for $900 (MSRP $1,100).Finally, you might consider waiting for the rumored iPhone Fold, which is expected to come out later this year. Initial rumors put the price somewhere between $2,100 to $2,500, and while price definitely includes the Apple Tax, it's still much cheaper than the TriFold.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        With the monumental winter storm recently covering most of the nation, now seems a good time to look at some cold and winter weather myths and misinformation. You might be freezing, but there's no excuse for being freezing and ignorant. Myth: A blizzard is a heavy snowstormTechnically, for a storm to be a blizzard, it must have these things: wind speeds of over 35 mph and low visibility (under 1/4 mile) for at least three hours. So you could have blizzard from blowing snow, even if no snow is falling, and you could get a ton of accumulation without it technically ever being a blizzard. (Whether it's a snowstorm or a blizzard likely won't matter to you if you're trapped in it, however.)There's some nuance to this one. Extremely cold air contains very little moisture, but it has to be very cold. According to Matt Peroutka, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, \"Once the air temperature at ground level drops below about -10 degrees Fahrenheit, (-20 degrees Celsius), snowfall becomes unlikely in most places.\" \nBut there could still be something like snow. \"There actually is no such thing as too low a temperature for some sort of ice crystal to form and for such crystals to settle out and land on the surface,\" explains Fred W. Decker of the Oregon Climate Service at Oregon State University, in an interview with Scientific American. \"Such a deposit of ice needles is not usually considered 'snow,' however; in the Arctic, for instance, we might refer instead to an ice fog.\"Myth: You lose most of your body heat through your headI dug deeply into this myth here, but the bottom line is, not wearing a hat accounts for around seven to 10 percent of bodily heat loss because your head accounts for about seven to 10 percent of your body. On the other hand, how cold you feel is subjective, and not wearing a hat in cold weather will probably make you feel colder, even if you're not actually losing most of your body heat. Bottom line: Wear a hat to feel warm in cold weather, or don't wear a hat to prove you're not losing too much heat.Myth: Alcohol keeps you warm in cold weatherIn an emergency situation, drinking brandy from the cask around a rescue St. Bernard's neck is a bad idea. Alcohol makes you feel warm by dilating blood vessels, but it actually lowers your body temperature by drawing heat away from your core, which increases your risk of hypothermia. But, much like \"losing heat through your head\" myth, drinking alcohol often makes people feel warmer, so if you're safe on your porch and you want a hot toddy, it will seem to \"warm you up.\" Speaking of...\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMyth: Drinking hot liquids warms you faster than drinking cold liquidsIt's probably impossible to drink enough of a hot liquid to raise the temperature of your body’s core. On the other hand (and for the third entry in a row) it might make you feel warmer to drink something warm, and often that's what you really want, even if it isn't literally making you warmer. So if you're safe on your porch and you want a hot tea to feel cozy, go for it. Traditional winter signs that don’t actually predict anythingThere might be a lot we can learn from folk traditions, but man, they get a lot of things wrong too. The following are some folklore sayings about winter that seem dubious:Thick corn husks, onion skins, and apple skins means a cold winter: The thickness of the outside of vegetables reflect the condition under which they were grown; they don't predict the future. Squirrels with very bushy tails means a cold winter: Like the vegetables, the thickness of a squirrel's tail is generally determined by how healthy and fed it was leading up to winter. More nuts in summer means beefier squirrels. You can predict winter severity by looking at a caterpillar tail: They say the wider the rusty brown sections on a wooly caterpillar, the milder the coming winter will be. The more black there is, the more severe the winter. The problem is, you'd have to look at a lot of caterpillars to even check if this is true, because some would have wider brown stripes and some wouldn't.  According to University of Massachusetts entomology Mike Peters in the Farmer's Almanac, “There’s evidence that the number of brown hairs has to do with the age of the caterpillar—in other words, how late it got going in the spring. The [band] does say something about a heavy winter or an early spring. The only thing is … it’s telling you about the previous year.”Weird myth: This winter storm was manmade and designed to freeze a gigantic sea serpentThe weirder corners of the internet are spreading the theory that the Biblical beast Leviathan has awakened, and the winter storm was created by us to freeze it in its tracks. Their evidence is satellite photos which seem to show a gigantic serpent shape in the Atlantic Ocean. As much as I'd welcome a Biblical sea monster rising from the ocean to seek retribution—all hail Leviathan!—it's unlikely to exist. I'm 99.9% certain (still have some hope) these were natural geological formations seen on Google Earth being mistaken for a sea monster as a result of pareidolia, the human tendency to see patterns in random data. Also: We can't control winter storms any more than we can control hurricanes, even if we were about to be eaten by a sea monster. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Outages happen, of course, as anyone who has Verizon can attest. But in the moment, theories were flying left and right. TikTok had just officially moved into U.S. control, leading some to speculate that the outage had something to do with this change in ownership. As one user put it, \"TikTok being down days after the people they were forced to sell to take it over does not feel like a coincidence.\" As it happens, it does appear that the changing of the guard was responsible for the outage—just not in the way that some conspiracy theories might suggest. TikTok finally released a statement on X Monday morning, attributing the outage to issues at a U.S. data center. The statement is as follows: \"Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.\"   The outage might not be the only thing different about TikTokFor its part, TikTok is very much operational at the moment. If the issue really was just isolated to a power outage at this data center, that data center appears to have patched things up. But that doesn't mean the company's reputation is patched up. Users are accusing the app's new owners of changing the algorithm, complaining of reset For You Pages, irrelevant content in feeds, and AI-generated content. I've seen users accuse the app of blocking anti-Trump and anti-ICE content, while comedian Gianmarco Soresi says even some of his non-political TikToks have \"zero views,” which he attributes to the ineffectiveness of the people running the app. (I've reached out to TikTok for comment on user reports of changes to the algorithm and will update if I hear back.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWe'll need more time to know whether or not there were serious changes made to TikTok's algorithm and user feeds in the wake of this sale. But the app is running—at least, for now.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If your alerts from messaging apps are too loud, you can either put the Mac in do-not-disturb mode to mute those alerts, or lower the system volume, but that's it. It's not ideal, since lowering system volume also impacts media volume, which can sometimes make it hard to listen to music or hear dialogue in TV shows or movies. If you could separately toggle volume levels per app, that would be ideal. Fortunately, some third-party apps allow you to do this, and this guide highlights the best of them.FineTune: A free Mac app for per-app sound control\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nA free app that lets you lower or mute alert tones while maintaining media volume, FineTune is good enough for most people. It's open-source, and has a few simple sliders that let you control each app's volume level. My previous pick for this job—BackgroundMusic—no longer works well, as it hasn't been updated in a while. FineTune's come in to fill that gap nicely, and it does what it says on the tin.Once you install the app, you can click its menu bar icon to finetune any individual app's volume. When an app starts playing audio on your Mac, it'll appear in FineTune's interface. And once you're done moving your sliders to change volume levels, you'll quickly discover a couple of other useful features, such as controlling the volume levels of each of your output device (speakers, headphones, etc.), and an equalizer for each app on your computer. You can also send audio from one app to a specific speaker or headphone. I've used these features to lower my AirPods' volume while keeping my Mac's speaker louder, and to set a bass-friendly EQ preset on those AirPods. You can play around with these tools to get the job done according to your needs, too.\nFineTune also has a convenient volume boost feature, which lets you increase the volume up to 400% on a per-app basis. This is good for files where the volume levels are almost inaudible, but I'd be choosy about how you use it.SoundSource: A paid app for advanced volume control\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nMost people will be happy with FineTune's feature set and lack of a price tag. However, if you need an app that can control AirPlay devices in your house, send audio to multiple devices at once, enable a per-app EQ with two dozen presets, set a preferred device order for audio output, and much more, then you should consider SoundSource 6 ($49). The app's been around for over a decade, and the newest version released towards the end of 2025.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWith SoundSource, the basic functionality lets you control the audio levels of each app, but it also has a few other neat touches. My favorite feature is the one that lets you mute all sound effects with just one click. I'm not sure about you, but alert sounds from messaging apps tend to make me a bit anxious. Some of my friends tend to send multiple short texts at once, too, which makes my Mac's speaker go off like a siren. I've tried putting my Mac on do-not-disturb mode, but that hides those alerts altogether, which isn't ideal either. Ever since I got SoundSource, I've just muted all sound effects. This lets me receive notifications without the annoying tones, and it allows me to watch movies sans interruptions from alert tones.You can also group multiple devices in SoundSource, and send audio to all of them at once, which is an easy way to create a multi-room audio setup. Of course, you can't have your audio 100% in sync, so don't get your hopes up about creating a surround sound system with five cheap Bluetooth speakers. However, it's good enough if you just want to have music playing in every room of your house while you cook, clean, or just move around. SoundSource's support for AirPlay devices means that you can send audio to your HomePod and other AirPlay devices like TVs or speakers, too.SoundSource also has granular controls for various features. As an example, you can set up a keyboard shortcut to increase or decrease your microphone's volume, or to mute the mic altogether. Another interesting feature lets you set up a mute timer, which sets the volume to zero for up to 2 minutes for specific apps or output devices. It's clear by now that SoundSource has lots of great features under the hood, which is amazing for power users, but probably overkill for anyone who just wants to set separate volume levels for a couple apps. The good news is that SoundSource offers a free trial that lets you use all of its features for up to 20 minutes at a time, so you can try it out to see if it's worth buying.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That’s what makes this current deal on the Eufy Security SoloCam S220 4-Camera Pack worth considering. It’s currently down to $179.99 on Amazon—a sharp drop from its usual $399.99, and its lowest price ever, according to price-trackers. At roughly $45 per camera, you’re getting full perimeter coverage for less than the cost of a single premium camera from some competitors, making this a solid value for anyone trying to keep an eye on multiple entry points.\nThese are wire-free units powered by built-in solar panels, which means you don’t need to mess with wires or outlets. That said, if your mounting spots don’t get much sun, you might still need to charge them manually from time to time. Once they’re running, video is recorded at 2K resolution, which is sharp enough during the day, and holds up well at night with infrared. Motion alerts use onboard AI detection that can tell people from pets. You can also draw up to two activity zones per camera, which helps cut down on useless notifications. There’s two-way audio, so you can speak to someone at your door or driveway, and support for Alexa and Google Assistant, though Apple HomeKit isn’t supported.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThese cameras each include 8 GB of onboard storage, which might last a week or two depending on how much activity they pick up. But if you want facial recognition or need longer backups, you’ll need to pick up the HomeBase 3 separately. Also worth noting: This system only works on 2.4GHz wifi, so if your router is overloaded or your signal strength varies, expect some hiccups. Still, for less than half the original price, this bundle checks most of the boxes for basic outdoor security without monthly fees or complicated installation.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But Android Auto's capabilities go beyond aesthetics and the apps that pop up when you turn on the car. There's a hidden shortcut switch you can enable to run an action in the car that's programmed on your phone. No matter what car you're driving, if it has Android Auto, the shortcut is there. This is the Custom Assistant Shortcut, and it's been part of Android Auto since early 2021. The feature is worth revisiting now that Gemini is slowly rolling out to replace the legacy Google Assistant on Android Auto. Gemini's natural language processing enables it to handle more complex routines, so you're not just programming a rote command you could have otherwise said out loud. The Custom Assistant Shortcut is labeled a \"secret\" feature because it's camouflaged beneath a main text label in the Android Auto settings menu. I didn't even think to look for it until I stumbled across the trick on an Android blog, but once you find it, it only takes a minute to set up. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are several ways to configure the Custom Assistant Shortcut. For example, if you rely on the latest episode of a podcast to carry you through the morning commute, you could set up a shortcut to play the most recent episode via an app that plays well with Gemini, like Spotify or YouTube Music. I prefer to use the Custom Assistant Shortcut for a simpler sequence of actions: finding the nearest branded gas station, no matter where I am in my journey. I programmed the shortcut with the command \"Navigate to the nearest [branded gas station].\" This begins driving directions to the fuel station I specified, where I can count on adequate lighting and decent bathrooms. It's easier than pawing through the Google Maps app on the Android Auto screen, then looking for the sub-menu option that shows fuel stops, and then sorting through every single option within five miles when you select it. This version of the shortcut is also super helpful on road trips, especially solo ones. \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you're into home automation, this shortcut gets even more powerful. You can program a Google Home Routine so that a phrase triggers a domino effect of actions. Imagine a routine that prepares for your arrival by opening the garage door, disarming the security system, and turning on the lights before you've ever pulled into the driveway. How to build the Custom Assistant shortcut in Android AutoYou don't need to be in your car to set up the Custom Assistant Action. On your phone, navigate to your Android Auto settings, then scroll down and tap on Customize launcher. Under the main heading, tap the smaller text that says Add a shortcut to the launcher. Select an Assistant action. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFrom here, the most robust option is to write out a specific command. Something like \"Navigate Home,\" or \"Play the latest episode of [podcast title] on [media player].\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTest out your Custom Assistant ShortcutYou can take the shortcut for a spin in your car before hitting the road. The ability to test the command will pop up when you connect your phone to the car. You'll see your new shortcut appear in the app drawer as a standard app icon. It will have a small Gemini asterisk in the corner to distinguish it from native apps (it may still show the legacy Assistant icon in your phone's settings). The \"Test Command\" button is on the same page where you set up the Custom Assistant Shortcut. Tap it, and you'll know your shortcut is working if the signature rainbow Gemini glow pulses at the bottom of the screen. If not, try adjusting the wording of your command and continue testing until it's a go. Things to note about Custom Assistant Shortcut in Android AutoThese actions are tied to your Google account on your phone, so if you hop into another car with Android Auto, the button will follow you to the display. Remember that Gemini requires a stable data connection to process those requests. If you're driving through a cellular \"dead zone,\" the shortcut might hang, which is annoying while driving. If the shortcut is hard to find in the app drawer, remember you can return to the Customize Launcher menu in the phone's settings and reorder the shortcuts so they're at the top of the drawer. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you’ve never owned a Garmin watch and want to try one out, the best budget Garmin for runners is down to its lowest price ever, according to price-tracking tools. You can get the Garmin Forerunner 55 for $149 (originally $199.99).\nAs Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki said in her intensive search for the best fitness watches for runners, the Garmin Forerunner 55 is the best budget choice you can make, especially at this record-low price. You get some features that have historically only been found in the premium versions, like the Respiration Rate Tracker feature, which tracks your breathing rate. The battery life is up to two weeks when it’s in standby mode and 20 hours when using GPS tracking.\nYou can use the Daily Suggested Workouts to suggest how to train to reach your running goals. If you like to run on tracks, you can choose which lane you’re in with Track Mode, which gives you exact pacing for much better accuracy, snapping your times at 100-meter intervals. Based on those numbers, you can also see the Race Predictor, which tells you how you’d fare in a marathon and other race lengths using your VO2 max and other metrics. There's also Recovery Hours, which suggests how long you should wait until you do another intense workout. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile the Forerunner 55 was released back in 2021, it's still a great budget option in 2026 since Garmin is known for supporting devices with updates for several years. At this price, you can get a great runner companion to keep track of your miles and still make the rent next month.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Clawdbot is designed to be an agentic personal assistant. In layman's terms, that means the bot can perform tasks on your behalf: You give it full access to your computer, and it can organize your inbox, code for you, or clear your calendar (allegedly, anyway). You can also talk to it from a chat app of your choice, like WhatsApp or iMessage, rather than it's own interface. Some people are even buying Mac minis exclusively to run Clawdbot from. If you're wondering where that name came from, it takes after another AI company's product. Creator Peter Steinberger says he was inspired by the monster that appears when users reload Claude Code—Claude being one of the big AI products in the space right now, developed by the company Anthropic. Steinberger decided to go the lobster route with his logo, and named his own lobster mascot \"Clawd.\" From this, Clawdbot was born. The problem: Anthropic also calls Claude Code mascot \"Clawd.\" Whoops.By Tuesday, Clawdbot was no more (in name, anyway). It turns out companies like Anthropic don't appreciate it when you start your own business and use the name of their mascot as your own—especially when you're working in the same ridiculously lucrative field. Maybe if Clawdbot had never taken off, Anthropic wouldn't have noticed, but the bot became an internet sensation, which no doubt landed it on Anthropic's  radar. As such, Clawdbot has officially changed its name to \"Moltbot,\" suggesting a lobster molting from its shell. Clawd is now affectionally known as \"Molty.\" The company made the announcement on its official X page, noting that Anthropic had asked it to change the name over \"trademark stuff.\" (Steinberger struck a different tone on his personal X account, however, writing: \"I was forced to rename the account by Anthropic. Wasn't my decision.\")\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAside from the name change, the bot appears to be the same as it was on Monday. That is to say, it's still open source, still available to run locally on your own device, and still comes with the same inherent security risks I outlined yesterday. I still wouldn't recommend you install a program like Moltbot on your personal device, since, name change or not, you'd still be giving it incredible access to your hardware and its data with little knowledge of the safeguards in place to protect it. All it could take is one malicious prompt injection for Moltbot to molt your security.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users. There are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.  The main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag. \nWhat you need to take full advantage of the new AirTagAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags. Even if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)If you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBuy an older AirTag if you don't meet these specificationsApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags. That's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.If you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The platform is speedy, simple, and supports just about every streaming app out there.If you've got a Roku or two in your life, you may not be using it to its full potential. These tips, hacks, and hidden features should help you go beyond the basic business of launching your streaming apps and get more out of your hardware, whether you've just unboxed your first Roku device, or you've been using one for years.Set up PIN protection to protect your RokuIf you've got young kids or nosy housemates living with you, you can lock certain parts of the Roku experience (including making purchases and adding new channels) behind a PIN number. This is actually done through your Roku account page on the web: Click PIN/parental controls on the left, and you can set a new PIN or change an existing one.Change the look and feel of your Roku with a new themeYou don't have to settle for the standard Roku interface visuals—you can easily switch to a different theme (which basically means a different wallpaper and screensaver). From Settings on your device, choose Themes to see alternatives provided by Roku and other people in the Roku community. You can always pick Restore default theme to go back to the original look.Enable captions on replayYou might not want closed captions on all the time, but you can have them enabled whenever you skip backward. From the home screen, pick Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode > On replay to enable this. Note that the streaming app you're using needs to support the feature as well, so it may not work everywhere.Put your most-watched apps up topThis is a simple and effective one that you might not have got around to doing: You can organize the apps on the home screen so your most-used are nearer the top and easier to get to. Select any tile on the home screen, press the star button on your remote to bring up the context menu, and you'll see the Move app and Move app to top options.Make use of Guest Mode when you have company\n    \n            \n            Roku devices come with a Guest Mode included.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's great having guests—but don't let them mess up your recommendations and viewing progress. You can put your Roku device into Guest Mode by opening Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Guest Mode > Enter Guest Mode. You'll be signed out of all your apps, and the Roku device will restart ready for someone else to use it.Send your photos to your Roku to view them on the big screenYou won't always be watching films and shows on your Roku of course—and when your streaming device isn't doing anything else you can get images from your Google Photos library up on your TV. To set this up, you need to head to the Photostreams page on the Roku website, sign in using your account, and then follow the instructions online.Set up a cross-platform Roku watchlistThere will often be times when you see something interesting, but don't have time to watch it right away, and that's when the Roku watchlist feature can help. Select any movie or show from the home screen, and on the listing page use the Save button to add it to your list: You can then pick Save List from the main menu to see what you've saved.Pair your Bluetooth headphones to your RokuIf you've got a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and a Roku device that supports Bluetooth, you can pair the two together for some private audio listening— handy if you don't want to disturb anyone around you. You can do this by heading to Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Remotes & devices > Wireless headphones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nListen to your Roku via your smartphoneThere's another way to listen through headphones, and it doesn't require Bluetooth or wireless headphones. If you install the aforementioned Roku app on your smartphone, then plug a pair of headphones into your phone as well, you can tap Remote control in the app and then the headphone button to stream the audio right to your ears.\n    \n            \n            You can use the mobile app to listen over headphones.\n                                        Credit: Roku\n                    \n    \nMirror your other devices to your RokuApple devices: Roku sticks, boxes and TVs come with support for the Apple AirPlay standard built right in, so you can beam across audio and video from Apple devices, or even mirror your Mac display on the big screen. On the Roku, choose Settings then Apple AirPlay and HomeKit to make sure you're set up, then just select the AirPlay button on your Apple hardware.Android devices: For screen casting, you're not left out if you're on Android, though—as usual with Android—capabilities vary between devices. Samsung Galaxy phones have the smoothest integration: Swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen, choose Smart View, and your Roku should show up as a connection option (if it's on the same wifi network).Windows devices: If you want to mirror your screen to a Roku from Windows, the process is different again. First, enable the feature on the Roku via Settings > System > Screen mirroring. Next, from Windows, click the volume and wifi icons down in the lower right corner, click the Display button, then select your Roku. Again, it needs to be on the same wifi network.Quickly find the cheapest way to rent a show or movieIf you're in the mood for a movie rental, then you've got a whole host of different streaming services to choose from—all the big ones offer film rentals on top of the content you get with your subscription. Use the Search option from the main Roku menu to look for a title, and compare the different prices across all the services you're signed up to.Control your TV with your Roku remoteYou can turn your TV on and off and adjust its volume with your Roku remote, if you'd like to. You're asked if you want to do this when you first set up your Roku device, but you can configure it afterwards too: Pick Settings > Remotes & devices > Remotes, then choose the remote you've currently got connected, and then pick Set up remote for TV control.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    ",

Normally $99.99, these true wireless earphones have been widely praised for what they offer at this price point. PCMag even named them the best budget earphones of 2023 and gave them an Editor’s Choice badge. That alone makes this deal worth a closer look, especially if you’re looking for a sub-$60 option with solid noise cancellation and more-than-decent sound quality.\nThe Liberty 4 NC earbuds check a lot of boxes. They support active noise cancellation (ANC), have a punchy bass-heavy sound, and come with a companion app that gives you an 8-band EQ and customizable controls. They’re compatible with Android’s LDAC codec and Google Fast Pair, while multipoint connectivity lets you stay connected to two devices at once. Each earbud has a responsive touch panel, and the layout—playback, skip, noise mode toggle—is easy to get used to. You can tweak it in the app if you need to add volume controls. There’s a Transparency mode too, for when you don’t want to fully block out the outside world.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBattery life clocks in at around 10 hours without ANC (or eight with it on), and the case adds another 40 hours (32 with ANC). The USB-C case also supports Qi wireless charging. On the downside, the IPX4 rating means they’re only splash-resistant, not something you’d want to dunk or rinse. And while the ANC isn’t perfect, it does noticeably cut down low-end background noise like airplane engine hum or cafe chatter, though higher-pitched sounds may still bleed through a bit, according to this PCMag review. That’s a common tradeoff at this tier, and for $56.99, it’s not a bad one. The Liberty 4 NC is available in four colors—black, white, light blue, and navy blue—at the time of writing, and all ship with four ear tip sizes for a decent fit. For everyday listening, travel, or WFH Zoom calls, this is one of the strongest wireless earbud options under $60 right now.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've bought anything from Amazon recently, keep an eye out: Bezos' baby could owe you some money.How to get Amazon's returns settlementIf you've had difficulty returning an Amazon package recently, you could have a paycheck coming your way soon. As reported by Reuters, the company has agreed to a $309 million cash settlement (in addition to \"other benefits\") with affected customers, alongside more than $600 million in individual refunds. According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the settlement as a whole provides more than $1 billion in relief.The lawsuit accused the e-commerce giant of causing \"substantial unjustified monetary losses\" with its return policies, which the plaintiffs say resulted in many customers returning items only to be charged for them anyway. Amazon denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but did say it will spend more than $363 million improving its return and refund practices.\nThe company claims that, after an internal review last year, it \"identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent to us, so no refund had been issued.\" However, Amazon said it had taken steps to resolve the issue, as seen in the refunds on years-old returns the company started issuing last year.The settlement is still awaiting approval from U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle, but as both parties support it, it'll likely come soon. The class would cover \"U.S. purchasers of goods on Amazon from Sept 2017 who allegedly did not receive timely or correct refunds, or who were later charged despite returning items,\" writes Reuters.It's currently unclear how class members would file a claim, or how the $309 million cash settlement and $600 million individual refunds will be divvied up. However, the plaintiffs told the court that class members should expect to recover the full amount of lost funds, plus interest.Eligible class members are often contacted by email, so keep an eye out. In the meantime, you can also search for legal updates using the case name, \"In re: Amazon Return Policy Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 2:23-CV-1372-JNW.\"How to get Amazon's Prime settlementWhile Amazon's returns settlement is still in its early phases, it's not the biggest payout the company's had to make this year. Earlier this January, Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over accusations that it had essentially tricked people into either signing up for or staying subscribed to Prime. Claims are going out in two ways, one of which is automatic, and the other you have to sign up for.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAccording to the settlement website, as well as the FTC, automatic payments should have gone out already, and applied to people who meet the following requirements:You are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025, andYou enrolled through a Challenged Enrollment Flow, andYou used no more than three Prime benefits in a 12-month period from June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025.If that doesn't sound like you, or you didn't receive a payment, you'll need to file a claim using the \"File Claim\" button on the settlement website. You're eligible to do this if you meet the follow requirements:You are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime, andYou unintentionally enrolled in a Prime membership through a challenged enrollment method at issue in the FTC’s lawsuit from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025; or you tried to cancel your Prime membership through the online cancellation process from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025, but were unable to do so; and You used less than ten Prime benefits (e.g., delivery, shopping, streaming, reading, and other benefits provided to Prime members) during any 12-month period of enrollment in Prime, and You did not receive an automatic payment as part of this Settlement already.Neither website is entirely clear about what constitutes \"challenged enrollment,\" aside from saying that Amazon enrolled customers in Prime without their knowledge or consent. Luckily, you probably won't need to do any legwork to see if you're eligible.According to the FTC, Amazon has begun sending claim notices by mail or email to eligible Prime customers who didn't already get an automatic refund. This will be your cue to sign up for your cut of the settlement, and in fact, you'll need the included Claim ID and PIN to do so. If you believe you're eligible for a share of the settlement but Amazon did not contact you, you can reach out to [email protected] for help.Once you file your claim, you can choose to be paid either through check, PayPal, or Venmo. Expected payments will differ from person to person, but will cap out at $51. And there's no need to rush. The deadline to file a claim is July 27, 2026, so you've got some time to ensure you get what you're owed.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Right now, there is zero friction involved in opening Instagram or TikTok, and getting sucked into their algorithms. But add a paywall to those apps, and all of a sudden, I don't have any interest in logging on. If that sounds like it'd work on you too, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that Meta will soon test a subscription model for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The bad news is that these subscriptions won't be required to actually access the app, or the core features you already know. That will remain free, so we will remain hopelessly addicted. The details are light at the moment, especially concerning WhatsApp and Facebook. Meta told TechCrunch that the subscriptions will offer \"exclusive features\" on its apps, and will \"unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\" That will include more controls over how you share and connect with other users. Again, pretty vague. \nPerhaps part of this cloak-and-dagger approach is that Meta isn't really sure how it wants to roll out these subscriptions. The company explained to TechCrunch that it was testing a \"variety of subscription features and bundles,\" and that each app's subscription will feel unique from the others. While Meta isn't revealing much at this point, we might have a glimpse at what the company has in store for Instagram. Reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi posted on X that Instagram's paid subscription will include the option to create as many audience lists as you want, view a list of people you follow who don't follow you back, and—perhaps more enticing to some—look at another user's story without them knowing you saw it. Would you pay a monthly subscription to be able to lurk in other people's Instagram stories? (It's possible to do this already, by the way.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's another feature set that Meta plans to test subscriptions for that likely includes all three of these apps: AI features. Meta will experiment with subs for Vibes, the company's short-form AI video app built into Meta AI. The services has been free since it launched last fall, and will likely continue to be free, but Meta may charge for \"additional video creation opportunities.\" As much as I'm reluctant to say so, this really is Meta doing subscriptions right. I wouldn't pay for any of these features, but it's not like the company is taking away previously free features and locking them behind a subscription. If companies like Meta want to integrate a subscription model, they need to offer new features and abilities to justify the price. I might not think these anticipated features are worth it, but at least the current apps as they exist will remain free—even if charging for them would get me to stop using them for good. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

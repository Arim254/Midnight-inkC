Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.And then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

You can (and should) prioritize your to-dos by timeliness and time box your way to a jam-packed, detailed schedule, but there’s more to time management than that. You should also consider dividing up not only your day, but your week overall, to maximize productivity. The trick here is to theme your workdays. Instead of jumping from task to task on any given day, try grouping all the similar ones together and parking them on a specific day, when your schedule allows. By putting similar tasks together on the same day, you’ll stay in that “zone” longer, focusing only on what needs to be done in it. If all the things you have to do have something in common, you’ll stay focused on the central theme of the day’s work as you move from task to task.How to divvy up themed days for productivityFirst, start by thinking about why you want to do what you're doing. I don't mean you need to get all philosophical, but adding a \"why\" to your to-do list is valuable. You don't just want to clean your house because you have to, but because you want a safe, comfortable space or because your mom is coming to say for a week and you want her to feel cozy (and not harp on you about any lingering dust). You don't just want to finish your big project at work because it was assigned to you, but because you want to grow in your career, stay employed, or get a promotion. If thinking this way is a stretch for you, try setting SMART goals around your tasks. SMART goals are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (in accordance with the acronym) and they help you stay focused on why you're doing what you're doing, as well as how you're going to do it.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSet these intentions so you feel like you have something to work toward. That's where the daily themes come in. If you complete similar tasks over the course of one day, you are striving for an intention—meeting whatever goal you’ve set for that day’s theme—and staying focused on it from task to task.Say you have a big project at work. Here's how your first three days could look: Consider getting all administrative-type work done on Mondays. Designate Mondays for responding to emails, sending out new ones, taking calls, or scheduling meetings. Make sure you use this day to request any resources, details, or answers you need from others involved in the project, so you have everything you need for the following days. Creative activities, like brainstorming or designing, could be handled Tuesday, while Wednesday could be for research.You could also theme your days by project, according to Leonard Alexandru, an engineering director at Deloitte who has written about the value of themed days. Instead of dedicating time every day to multiple projects, consider assigning each project its own specific day of the week for work, so a project that requires a big focus on management should take up a whole day while one that requires you to focus on marketing, communications, sales, or whatever else should be on another.Why this works (and what to keep in mind)I do this around my apartment: One day is for cleaning my bedroom, the other is for the living room, and another is for the kitchen. It is that simple—and broadly applicable beyond your job. Hell, if you do strength training, you probably already do arm day, back day, leg day, etc. You wouldn't do a lat pulldown on leg day because it wouldn't make sense to exhaust your whole body, nor divert your focus from your glutes and quads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reason it works is the same reason divvying up gym days works. When you are focused entirely on one thing, you do better at it, which makes you more productive at it. When you throw everything into the metaphorical blender, you lose that focus. Plus, the stress of figuring out what to do at a given time is gone, leaving you open to just get to work. You can \"eat the frog\" (that is, tackle your biggest task first) or work off a system like 1-3-5, which calls on you to take care of one major task, three medium-sized ones, and five smaller ones. With a themed grouping, you don't have to decide what those are; you just go.Try setting each day’s theme as an all-day event on whatever calendar software you use, so you’ll have a reminder at the top of the page about what to focus on each day. Just knowing your Thursdays are for client meetings, for instance, relieves you of the anxiety of deciding what to prioritize that day or when to schedule those meetings. It eliminates decision fatigue and keeps you on-task without you having to think too hard about what activity should go in what slot during your busy week. Obviously, a necessary or urgent meeting could crop up on a day that isn't Thursday. It's fine to take it, of course, but try to keep the general framework of the themed days whenever you can. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I've written before about other ways to mold Pomodoro to match what you need, but today's idea, Pomodoro 2.0, is one of the easiest and most effective adaptations. What do I mean by \"Pomodoro 2.0?\"First, a refresher on what the Pomodoro technique even is. When you're using this technique to focus and be productive, you set an alarm for 25 minutes, work for that time, then take a five-minute break. You complete that cycle four times, then give yourself a longer break at the end, up to half an hour, before starting again. That's it. It works because you spend those relatively short bursts concentrating on the task at hand, knowing a reprieve is coming. Since they're not too long, it doesn't feel insurmountable. It also works because those breaks play an important role. Taking periodic breaks can make you more productive, both because they give your brain a rest and because they stop you from toiling to the point that your output gets shoddy.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nI saw the idea of \"Pomodoro 2.0\" mentioned on a forum a while back and started Googling. What I found impressed me—it addresses one of the main critiques I have of the original, which is that 25 minutes isn't always enough time to get into a state of deep work, or work that is uninterrupted, purely focused, and effortless enough that time seems to be flowing by.Over at Beyond Productivity, Dr. Christian Poensgen recommends starting the Pomodoro session with a 30-minute work block, then adding more time to it after the break, tacking on between 15 or 60 minutes. I recommend doing this incrementally, adding 15 every time, so you work for 30, then 45, then 60, and finally 75 minutes before your big break. Adding too much too soon—or working in too-large chunks all the way through—defeats one of the main purposes of the technique, which is to not get overwhelmed, so taking it slower and easier while still adding on time is the best bet.If you're not sure how much time to add on, familiarize yourself with the concept of flowtime. Also known as \"flowmodoro,\" the idea here is that you should track how long you can work on a given task before you feel drained, track how long your breaks need to be to make you feel reenergized, and start creating custom, Pomodoro-esque work and rest blocks for every kind of task you do in a given day. It takes a bit of data collection and planning, but it can help you master the general technique while still prioritizing deep work and breaks.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy use Pomodoro 2.0?The Pomodoro technique shines (and has been so popular for so long) because it helps you ease into your work, motivated by the small work sprints and promise of rewards. It's absolutely true that you need to take breaks to keep your productivity up, so that part should never be altered or skipped, but sometimes, 25-minute grind sessions just aren't enough and five minutes to reset isn't, either. Getting into a state of deep work takes time. Repeatedly stopping yourself before you hit that point is counter-productive. Giving yourself more time to work on harder, more complex tasks is critical in some instances, just like taking breaks. Adding time to the work blocks in increments helps you settle in and get more done without overwhelming yourself. You should consider this alteration if you have a major project that demands a lot of resources or energy, letting yourself build up to the hard parts as you add minutes to your timer. If you're trying this out and not getting the results you want, you can shake it up another way, too. Remember the idea of \"eating the frog,\" or tackling your biggest to-do list item first thing in the morning? Consider eating the frog in Pomodoro 2.0, starting with your 75-minute block and working backward to 60, 45, and 30. Remember, none of these rules are hard and fast; you can make changes that match your needs and personal preferences. If you're someone who doesn't get overwhelmed and has the ability to jump in on long-term work, this structure could suit you, as the promise of shorter and shorter work sessions can feel like a motivator of its own. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        If you've got the funds and the need for more than one computer on your desk, then you may well want to use the same mouse and keyboard for both of them. It's more convenient if you're switching between systems, and it means you can find a keyboard and mouse combination you love and stick to it throughout.This is particularly helpful if you're working on a laptop and a desktop in tandem. Even the best laptops tend to have cramped keyboards, just through the limitations of the form factor, and a mouse is often preferable to a trackpad for several tasks (such as detailed image or video editing).Sharing your mouse and keyboard between computers is actually easier than you might think—and certainly a lot easier than it was several years ago. You've got different options available depending on the different platforms you're dealing with, and these are the tools for the job I'd recommend right now.\nIf you're on Windows, use Mouse Without BordersMouse Without Borders is an official Microsoft program, but one of those official Microsoft programs that's more like a side project. It lets you control up to four computers using the same mouse and keyboard, as long as they're all running Windows.You don't need any complicated cabling or software setup: You just need the application installed on all the Windows computers you want to connect, and a mouse and keyboard plugged into one of them. On the first computer you set up the tool on, you'll be able to generate a code you can use to connect other computers.\n    \n            \n            Mouse Without Borders on Windows.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe main configuration screen lets you set the layout for your various Windows machines, which is important—to move from one system to another, you just drag the mouse cursor off the edge of one screen and on to another. The mouse and keyboard will interact with whatever computer the mouse cursor is currently active on.Mouse Without Borders also lets you create a universal, shared clipboard across every computer it's installed on, for easy transfer of files, text, and images. Note that Mouse Without Borders is also available as part of Microsoft PowerToys, a bundle of utilities that gives you a plethora of additional features and tweaks for Microsoft's operating system.If you're on macOS, use Universal ControlIf you're using two or more Macs together, Universal Control is the way to go for your keyboard- and mouse-sharing needs. The functionality is built right into macOS (and iPadOS), and works pretty seamlessly out of the box. Plus, it includes a lot more than the sharing of input devices.All you need is the latest version of macOS installed across your computers, the same Apple account linked to them all, and the mouse and keyboard you want to use as your main controllers. All your devices must have wifi and Bluetooth turned on, and your computers have to be fairly close together (as in, in the same room).\n    \n            \n            Universal Control on macOS.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can find the relevant settings for this part of Universal Control by opening the Apple menu (top left), then choosing System Settings > Displays > Advanced—for best results, make sure every option here is enabled. With this done on every Mac, all that you need to do is push the mouse cursor through the left or right edge of the screen on your current Mac to switch control to the other one, depending on how they're positioned.This positioning can be tweaked via System Settings > Displays > Arrange, if needed. Universal Control goes beyond peripheral sharing, too—you can drag files across the screen edge border to transfer them between computers. You'll also find there's a shared clipboard available across your linked devices—so you can copy on one computer, and paste on the other.If you're on both Windows and macOS, use SynergyFor those bold enough to try and use both Windows and macOS machines on a regular basis, Synergy is the most comprehensive mouse and keyboard sharing software that I've come across. Once you've got it installed on every computer you want to connect, you can share a mouse and keyboard between all of them.When you've got the desktop client up and running, you're greeted with a straightforward interface that lets you manage all of the various options the program offers: You can set up how your computers are positioned in relation to each other, for example, and configure how the shared clipboard will work across different systems.\n    \n            \n            Synergy on Windows.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe Synergy app should be able to automatically add other computers with Synergy installed that are on your network, but you can do this manually too. Via the Screen layout tab you can customize how your screens are positioned, and designate the primary computer (connected to the keyboard and mouse you want to use). You can then just move the mouse cursor across your screens to switch between systems.Synergy will cost you (though there is a free trial available): It's a one-off fee of $29 for the standard software, which supports up to three computers. You can also pay a one-off fee of $49 for the Ultimate edition of Synergy, which works across as many as 15 different machines, and gives you other bonus extras such as custom hotkeys.If you prefer, use a keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) switchThere's one more option here, which is to use a traditional keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) switch. It's a device you plug your keyboard and mouse into, and then connect to both your computers. As the name suggests, it lets you share a single monitor between two systems as well, if you need to.Nowadays you'll sometimes see this described as a hub, which is a more modern term for it. These hubs often come built into high-end monitors, so you plug your keyboard and mouse into the monitor, and then the monitor connects to your various computers through its multiple display ports—and you use controls on the monitor to jump between your systems as needed.\n    \n            \n            A 4K KVM switch\n                                        Credit: Mleeda\n                    \n    \nMore advanced KVM switches or hubs have support for multiple monitors, and other accessories and peripherals on top, but the more features you want the more money you're going to have to spend. A basic one for two computers will set you back around $30, while a more advanced one with support for four computers and its own remote is going to be more like $105.A Bluetooth keyboard/mouse comboThe $35 Logitech K480 will work with just about anything that supports Bluetooth, including computers, smartphones, and tablets. With this, switching among devices is as easy as turning a dial on the side of the keyboard.\n            ",

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. But it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple brought RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging to the iPhone with iOS 18 last year, giving green-bubble users access to more features and functions. But what exactly is possible with RCS on the iPhone, and what is still exclusive to iMessage users? Are Android RCS users now fully integrated into chats in the iOS Messages app or not?I'll lay out exactly what you can do in RCS chats between iPhones and Android phones, and explain which features are still missing—and when you might be able to get them.  If you've got contacts on other mobile platforms, this should help you understand more about what the experience is like from their end.To use RCS, you must have a carrier that supports it (most now do). On an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging to enable it. In Google Messages on Android, tap your profile picture (top right), then choose Messages settings and RCS chats to turn on the feature.\nEver since iOS 18, RCS messaging has officially been supported in the iOS Messages app—specifically, via the RCS Universal Profile 2.4. This brings green bubble Android users closer to parity with iMessage users, though some features only work in one direction, and some features only work in one-to-one conversations and not group chats.One notable upgrade is support for high-resolution photos and videos, which should work seamlessly across all your RCS-enabled conversations, with no more issues around compression or transfer. Web links look better as well, because you'll get a proper preview shown on both Android and iOS, and you can share current locations too (though only as a static pin, not a live and updating one).\n    \n            \n            Web links now look much better between iOS and Android.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTyping indicators and read receipts are supported in both directions, assuming you've got them enabled on your devices. However, they don't work in group chats—RCS users on Android can now join group chats, but the experience can be buggy based on reports, and you lose the typing indicators and the read receipts.Emoji reactions are now supported, up to a point—but based on my testing, these only work from iPhone to Android. If you try and send an emoji reaction in the other direction, iPhone users will just get a separate text showing the emoji (it won't appear as a bubble on top of the original message).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRCS on iOS and Android: what you can't do (yet)If you look at everything you can do in iMessage (with other iMessage users) and Google Messages (with other Android RCS users), you'll realize there's a long way to go when it comes to cross-platform support. For example, at the moment you can't unsend messages, or reply inline in a thread, either from Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android.You can edit messages, but only if you're an Android user messaging an iPhone user—and with the caveat that the iPhone user gets two texts (the original message and the edited message, which rather defeats the point). The ability to edit messages on an iPhone simply doesn't appear in an RCS conversation.\n    \n            \n            Message editing is something that doesn't quite work yet.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAnother missing feature is end-to-end encryption for your chats and files shared in them. Apple has promised that support for this in RCS conversations is on the way, though it hasn't shown up yet—not even in iOS 26. This should give you pause when it comes to sharing sensitive information in these chats.Full end-to-end encryption is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which Google is testing in beta and which Apple has yet to adopt. Once this next update finally makes its way to iPhones and Android devices, interoperability will be leveled up again—it should, in theory, bring with it full support for message editing, emoji reactions, and inline replies. Until then, it's something of a half-baked implementation, especially for group chats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Holiday shopping season is ripe for scammers, as consumers rush to find and take advantage of some of the best discounts of the year, and potentially overlook red flags that signal fraud. Security researchers are warning of an uptick in scams capitalizing on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype. Fraudsters know that they can prey on shoppers' sense of urgency and excitement for limited-time, exclusive deals—and AI is making these campaigns even more difficult to spot than usual. New data from McAfee suggest that nearly half of Americans have come across an AI-powered scam while shopping, from deepfakes impersonating celebrities pushing promotions to near-flawless spoofed websites that steal your credit card information. Here are the scams to watch for this Black Friday. \nSpoofed websites are a common type of a scam, and fraudsters use holiday shopping season to trap users with fake retail sites and sales pages that look legitimate but are actually just collecting data like your login credentials and payment information. Scammers will use stolen assets like logos and product photos from known and trusted brands, and AI makes it easy to set up a convincing (but fake) small business website with elements like a customer service page and consumer reviews in no time. Another shopping scam facilitated by AI is the impersonation scam. You think you're watching a popular influencer or celebrity promoting an exclusive deal or product giveaway on TikTok or another social media platform, but it's actually a deepfake. If you click through to enter or buy, you'll land on a counterfeit page (as outlined above) designed to steal from you. According to Google's November fraud and scam advisory, scammers can get eyes on their content by hijacking search terms for Black Friday sales, running deceptive ads, or pushing deals on social media. Fake storefronts may appear as sponsored links, which are easy to overlook if you're in a rush to make a purchase. Of course, you may encounter other common holiday scams, such as fake shipping notifications that request payment in order to resolve a delivery issue as well as account verification scams that prompt you to confirm personal details. These phishing and smishing campaigns use standard scam tactics like impersonating a legitimate company or service and sending a fraudulent link that collects your bank information or username and password combination. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlack Friday scam red flags When shopping holiday deals, slow down enough to look for common signs of scams. Fraudsters will use urgency—such as a limited time to secure a deal or a limited number of items left in stock—in hopes you won't think before you buy. You should also be wary of any deal that is too good to be true, or a promotion with especially low prices that are out of line with other sales on similar items. This includes influencers pushing \"exclusive\" opportunities. If you are purchasing from a small business you don't know, google the brand and read third-party reviews to see whether it is legitimate. Instead of clicking links from emails, texts, and social media posts promoting sales, go directly to the retailer's website and search for the deal. If you do click through, check the URL carefully to ensure it is legitimate (scammers may use homoglyphs that avoid detection at first glance) and look for website elements that real companies have, such as a privacy policy and address. If you see a promotion on social media, check the creator's account to see when they joined the platform, what they've posted in the past, and whether they are verified. Beware of any site that requires you to pay with a gift card, cryptocurrency, or bank transfer versus a credit card, which has some protection in the case of fraud. Legitimate retailers will use legitimate payment methods. Finally, never enter your login credentials unless you've confirmed that the site you're using is trustworthy. This includes delivery services and your Amazon and PayPal accounts, all of which scammers may pressure you to \"verify\" in order to resolve a billing or delivery issue. \n            ",

Whether you're walking outdoors or indoors, you can benefit from using guided walks to spice up your ambling. I love the walking video offered by Peloton, but I to access them, I pay $50 a month (though I get so much else as part of my subscription). But if you want a free option, there are some great ones on YouTube. They're similar to the free guided runs on the platform, but here, you just walk. (In general, if you want to find guided walking workouts on YouTube on your own, make sure to add \"outside\" or \"treadmill\" so you get results that will serve your needs.) Prowalk Tours (749,000 subscribers)\nFor \"walks\" around a specific location, Prowalk Tours might be the best out there. You can visit a variety of cities, markets, and locales from the comfort of your home or the gym. Running one of these on your phone or iPad while you use a treadmill is a great way to distract yourself and see what other parts of the world are like. There's no guidance, necessarily—at least not in an audio sense. This channel does divvy up the videos, though, so along the slider bar at the bottom of the player, you can see descriptions of the different areas you'll \"pass\" through. If there's a building you love in Paris, you can skip right to it. There are also other kinds of tours, like ones taken by boat and bike, so you can follow along on a stationary cycle or just watch and enjoy.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGet Fit With Rick (843,000 subscribers)\nI like this channel because it's much more exercise-focused, but still pretty chill—sometimes, you don't want to do Pilates or an all-out cardio session; you just want to walk. On the Get Fit With Rick channel, you can get motivation and pace cues, plus stretching and other movements (he might have you do some side-stepping or knee touches during a walk). Bear in mind he is stationary while he teaches, so you could actually just dance in place like he does, but you can—and should—walk around instead, hitting the beat of the music and keeping up with his pace cues. The variety of modifications available make this channel suitable for all levels. It's a great option if you're a beginner, having an active rest day, or just checking it out. The audio and video quality is high, which I always appreciate. You don't need incredible production values if the coaching is good, but it never hurts to actually be able to adequately hear and see the instructors.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSunny Health and Fitness (194,000 subscribers)\nYou might be familiar with Sunny if you've ever been scouring Amazon for cheap, at-home workout equipment. That was my first experience with the brand: I bought a tiny, mechanical elliptical from them that I used until I was able to get my own Peloton Bike. Their videos are like their products, in that they're straightforward and to the point, with no fuss or flare. They are geared specifically for walkers using treadmills, and offer pacing and form cues, plus motivation from a coach.IBX Running (59,000 subscribers)\nIBX appeared on my best YouTube running channels list too, because they offer so many options in terms of workout length and structure. One of the options? Just plain walking. The videos are abundant in volume, but more importantly, they're clear and useful: Side bars show you what your incline and pace should be, which many of the other channels don't do. This helps you stay motivated and work toward your fitness goals. Headspace (1 million subscribers)\nYou might be surprised to see Headspace here, since it's an app and platform dedicated to meditation and mental health, rather than exercise. But Headspace offers up some quality guided walking meditation videos I think are worth checking out. Exercise isn't just good for the body, but good for the mind, and sometimes, it's better to focus on that aspect, rather than just calorie burning. Think of them as guided walking meditations. If you want to take a stroll and be a little more mindful (while still reaping the physical benefits of moving around), start here. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

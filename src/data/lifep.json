Take a Message is a recently introduced feature for the Phone app that activates when the recipient is not available to answer (or declines the incoming call). The caller hears the following: “The person you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” If you, as the recipient, tap the Take a message notification on your device, you can see a transcript of the audio in real time and hit Answer if you want to pick up. (Take a Message will also detect spam calls and mark them with a warning.)A few users have reported that Take a Message has activated and allowed the caller to hear the recipient's background audio as they are leaving a message. It's important to note that this is not a widespread issue, and most of the reports come from people with older Pixel devices that no longer get OS updates. According to 9to5Google, Google is investigating the reports. \nAgain, while this doesn't seem to be a bug affecting most Pixel users, you can disable Take a Message if you are concerned about privacy, especially with unknown callers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to disable Take a Message on your PixelOpen the Phone app on your device and tap the icon in the top-left corner to open Settings. Tap Take a Message under the Call Assist section and toggle the feature off. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing. The issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As usual, many people will have the option to file their returns for free, but the options are more limited this year, as the short-lived IRS Direct File program, which provided no-cost filing to taxpayers in 25 states, is no more. If you want to avoid paying for the privilege of paying your taxes, here are the remaining ways to file for free in 2026. IRS Free File is one of several free filing options provided by the IRS. With Free File, you complete your tax return using guided software via a partner site, which then e-files it with the IRS. Most commonly used federal tax forms and schedules are available through Free File. However, your adjusted gross income must have been $89,000 or less in 2025 to be eligible for this option. \nIf you do qualify for Free File, go directly through the IRS website—you'll see a list of trusted third-party preparers with their eligibility criteria, or you can use the guided tool to find the best option for your situation. Note that some IRS partners will also file your state return for free, while others charge an additional fee. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther ways to file your taxes for freeIf you make too much for IRS Free File, you may still be able to file your taxes for free. Free Fillable Forms: This option is just like it sounds. You enter your information into the IRS' fillable forms using the provided instructions and file the return yourself. There are no income limits for Free Fillable Forms, but it does have limited guidance, and state returns are not included. You will still need to create a Free File account. Commercial tax software: If your taxes are relatively simple, you can go through tax preparation companies like TurboTax and H&R Block without paying any fees. Cash App Taxes is another free option. Note that these companies also have paid services, so make sure you understand what you are signing up for. Volunteer tax prep help: The IRS offers free tax prep support for eligible taxpayers through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs. Taxpayers who make less than $69,000 per year, who have disabilities, or who have limited English proficiency qualify for VITA, while TCE supports those who are age 60 and older. Enter your zip code into the locator tool to find volunteer tax prep options in your area. MilTax: MilTax offers free tax preparation and filing for eligible military members, including up to three state returns. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When it comes to phishing schemes, which typically try to trick you into handing over sensitive data or account credentials via malicious links, tech brands are (perhaps not surprisingly) among the most commonly spoofed.  A recent report from Check Point Research found that Microsoft was imitated in nearly a quarter of all branded phishing attempts in Q4 of last year—nearly double the next most-impersonated company. The most popular brands for phishing scamsAccording to researchers, tech companies and social networks are consistently among the most popular brands for impersonators running phishing scams, with the following share in the final quarter of last year: \nMicrosoft: 22%Google: 13%Amazon: 9%Apple: 8%Facebook (Meta): 3%PayPal: 2%Adobe: 2%Booking: 2%DHL: 1%LinkedIn: 1%While you should always be on guard for common phishing tactics, it's wise to be especially wary of unsolicited communication from any of the companies listed—especially if that communication is related to account security and/or urges you to click a link. We've covered at least one campaign involving nearly every brand here, all of which are known and largely trusted among users, making them prime targets for these types of scams. Check Point notes that stolen Microsoft and Google credentials are particularly valuable because they're widely used in day-to-day workflows. Common phishing tacticsBroadly speaking, a phishing scam starts with an email, text, or social media message that appears to be from a legitimate source. It likely asks you to update or verify personal information—often related to a payment or account security—with a link to what appears to be the company's website or login page. Of course, this link leads instead to a spoofed version of that site designed to harvest your credentials, credit card number, bank details, or other personal data, which scammers can then use for identity theft, account takeover, or purchase fraud. Note that while the above methods are among the most common, phishing can also happen via phone call, voicemail, and malicious browser pop-ups. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect against branded phishing attacksAs we mentioned, just because you generally trust a company doesn't mean you should blindly trust all communication from it. If you receive a message that is unprompted, sounds urgent, and is unrelated to any recent action on your part (such as a login attempt or bill payment), do not engage with it. Don't click any links, open any attachments, or respond directly. Look out for typos and other errors, including the original sender—though as scammers have found ways to appear verified, this isn't always an obvious red flag. If you're unsure about the contents of the message, go directly to the website or app and log in to see any legitimate alerts. A password manager offers an extra layer of security here, as it'll protect you from entering credentials on a spoofed page. Finally, enable a strong, phishing-resistant form of multi-factor authentication everywhere you can, and especially for high-use and high-value accounts like Microsoft and Google. If your credentials are compromised, threat actors won't have that additional factor to utilize them. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.Verizon credit phishing scamAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website. If you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it. \nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

NexShield pitched itself as a privacy-focused ad blocker from the developer of well-established and highly trusted uBlock Origin. However, as security firm Huntress found, the extension initiates a variation of the ClickFix attack that has been dubbed \"CrashFix\"—a reference to the browser crash that precedes the fake security warning and malicious command prompt. How NexShield's 'CrashFix' attacks your deviceAs BleepingComputer describes, the NexShield extension creates a denial-of-service (DoS) loop that exhausts your device's memory, ultimately freezing Chrome or Edge and causing it to crash. When the browser restarts, the extension displays a pop-up with a \"Run Scan\" button to identify \"potential security threats that may compromise your browsing data,\" leading users to believe that the crash resulted from a security issue. \nIf you follow through, you'll see another fake window with instructions for executing commands in the Windows command prompt. This is the ClickFix attack: a form of social engineering that relies on fake error messages, CAPTCHAs, and command prompts to trick users into deploying malware onto their own devices. In this case, the extension copies a command to the clipboard, and if users enter the keystrokes in the fake pop-up, downloads and executes a malicious script. After a 60-minute delay to avoid detection, NexShield delivers the payload that can run commands, fingerprint systems, and elevate privileges. Note that as of this writing, NexShield has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. How to protect your system from malwareIf you've installed NexShield, you should uninstall it and perform a full system cleanup to clear its payloads from your device. (We've got step-by-step guides to removing malware from your Mac and your PC.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs general protection against similar attacks, only install browser extensions from trusted sources. This isn't a guarantee that you'll never encounter a malicious add-on in the Chrome Web Store or in other browsers, as hackers occasionally manage to sneak through the approval process and even get their extensions labeled as trusted or verified. Some extensions are only later injected with malicious code, essentially \"waking up\" their ability to attack. Before installing a new extension, carefully check the creation date, reviews and ratings, and even the name, as malicious add-ons will often impersonate trusted ones (or, as in the case of NexShield, piggyback on legitimate brands like uBlock Origin). Watch for suspicious permissions—if the extension requests access to data or actions that seem excessive or are unrelated to its core function, it might be malware. Finally, never run codes or commands on your machine copied from websites or communication that you don't understand, and always verify instructions with an independent, trusted source.

    "body": "\n        \n        I'm something of a treadmill hater. When I do hop on one, it's only during times when it's truly unsafe to run outdoors. I know that the treadmill brings all the same physical benefits as running outside (because no, it is not “cheating” on your workout). However, I mourn all the mental perks of spending time outside. That's why it's necessary for me to use whatever mental tricks I can to transform a monotonous slog into an actually enjoyable workout. The best part? None of these require special equipment or significant time investment—just small, smart adjustments to your routine. Whatever reason you have for running indoors, here's how to make the most of your time on the treadmill.Set your treadmill's incline to 1%The treadmill isn't necessarily easier, but it can sure feel easier. There's a pervasive myth that the treadmill “moves your feet” and thus makes running easier, but that’s not true.However, if you do happen to be running at a pace of 7:30 per mile (8.0 mph) or faster, setting the treadmill’s incline to 0.5% or 1% is recommended to mimic outdoor air resistance. For those of us slower than that, the difference is so small as to be meaningless.\nEven though I'm not fast enough for it to be an issue, I like to set my treadmill's incline to 1% because it keeps me engaged mentally. It really is a minor change, and even if it's \"unnecessary,\" I appreciate the small challenge to make things feel less boring. Use a portable fan when running on a treadmillIn my experience, gym fans are unreliable. Overheating is one of the main reasons people quit treadmill workouts early. Indoor running means no natural breeze, so your temperature rises faster than it would outside.If you can't find a treadmill with a solid fan nearby (or built-in), use your own portable fan. I like to set it up to hit me at chest level. Trust me, the same effort feels way easier when you're not overheating.Improve your form when running on a treadmillStaring at the console could be killing your running form. When you look down at the display, your neck tilts forward, your shoulders round, and your stride shortens. Instead, pick a spot on the wall ahead of you—roughly the same spot you'd look at when running outside. Check your stats with quick glances rather than sustained staring. A lot of the times, I cover the display with a towel during speed work to avoid the temptation. Your posture will improve dramatically, and you might find running feels more natural.Keep your hands off the handrailsThe purpose of your treadmill run is to mimic natural walking and running strides as best you can. Holding onto the handrail can throw that off. Using the handrails transfers the workload meant for your legs and core into your upper body. If you feel the need to hold onto the handrails, it’s not the end of the world. But if it makes your workout significantly easier, think about what that likely means for the amount of work you’re putting into—and getting out of—your run.Use music to better pace yourself on the treadmillI love crafting a playlist that also works as a pacing mechanism. Songs have a tempo measured in beats per minute (BPM), and your running cadence (steps per minute) responds subconsciously to music tempo.Although there is no single “perfect” cadence, most runners fall around 160-180 steps per minute. Match your playlist to your target pace: slower songs for warm-ups and recovery, 150-160 BPM for easy runs, and 170-180 BPM for tempo work. Spotify even has running playlists organized by BPM. If nothing else, a good playlist will keep you motivated on such a monotonous machine.Play the \"descending intervals\" mental gameRunning hard intervals when you're already tired is tough. Flip the script with descending intervals: Start with your longest, hardest effort when you're fresh, then gradually decrease the interval length.For example: Five minutes hard, two minutes easy, then four minutes hard, two minutes easy, working down to one minute hard. Psychologically, this can feel much more manageable because each interval is easier than the last. You're essentially creating momentum that carries you through the workout, rather than dreading increasingly difficult efforts.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nVisualize a virtual route while running on the treadmillCombat treadmill boredom by mentally running a familiar outdoor route. Close your eyes briefly (only if you're comfortable and safe doing so) and visualize running through your neighborhood, a favorite trail, or even a dream destination.Take this further by matching your treadmill workout to the actual route profile. If there's a hill three miles into your usual run, increase the incline at the corresponding time on your treadmill. You could even use Google Maps street view before your workout to refresh your memory. For me, this mental trick makes time pass faster and maintains the connection between indoor and outdoor running.Motivate yourself with negative splitsRunning negative splits on the treadmill—where your second half is faster than your first—is a classic race-oriented goal. Start your run at a comfortable pace, then increase speed by 0.1-0.2 mph every 5-10 minutes.This approach works because it forces you to start conservatively, preventing the common mistake of burning out early. It also means you finish strong, and hey, that could help create a positive psychological association with treadmill running. More importantly, if you do have a race on the horizon, this type of workout trains your body to maintain energy for when it matters most.Practice using the treadmill's emergency stop featureMost people either ignore the safety clip entirely or fumble with it ineffectively. Practice your emergency stop before you need it. While walking slowly, pull the clip intentionally to see how the treadmill responds. Knowing exactly what happens when you pull it means you won't panic if you stumble. Hopefully you won't need to use it, but this little practice could prevent a serious injury.Do a post-workout incline stretchHere's my recovery hack of the day: After your run, leave the treadmill at a 10-15% incline, turn it off, and use it for calf and Achilles stretches. Stand on the belt with your toes elevated and heels dropped down. The incline creates the perfect angle for a deep, effective stretch.Hold for 30 seconds on each leg. This takes advantage of equipment you already have and addresses the tight calves that plague many treadmill runners. It's convenient, effective, and helps prevent the dreaded treadmill-induced stiffness.The bottom lineThe treadmill doesn't have to be a \"necessary evil.\" With these hacks, you can make indoor running safer, more effective, and genuinely more enjoyable. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll finally appreciate the unique benefits the treadmill offers: consistent pacing, controlled conditions, and the ability to execute very specific workouts regardless of weather.\n            ",

According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to subscribe to Full Self-Driving instead.Before, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).Now, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.Which features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.At any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Right now, the GoPro Max2 action camera is down from $499 to $399 on Amazon, marking its lowest price ever. \nCompared to the Max1, the Max2 has a higher 8K resolution and 29MP stills, resulting in sharper, more detailed footage and photos, while 10-bit color, GP-Log, and up to 14FPS Raw capture with 3D Tracking focus make it appealing for pros or anyone who wants more flexibility in post-production. It shoots 360-degree spherical video, unlike the single-lens action cams like the Hero, earning it an Editors' Choice Award from PCMag. This lets you record everything in your vicinity and reframe at any level, allowing for even more creative possibilities when editing.With a magnesium chassis and weather protection, it's built for adventures and high-impact environments, with waterproofing up to 5 meters, a compact build, easy-to-replace lenses, and a variety of mounting options. As part of the GoPro ecosystem, it works seamlessly with the GoPro Quik video editing app for edits and reframing, while Bluetooth mic support and voice control make it even more versatile. Still, compared to the Hero series and its sensor design, low-light performance may be weaker, and battery life varies depending on whether you’re shooting with both lenses, the resolution, and the frame rate. Long 8K sessions will be more demanding, during which heat buildup can also happen. Slow motion also maxes out at 100 fps, and editing isn’t as slick or built for social shares as platforms like Insta360. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf your priority is immersive storytelling, post-shoot reframing, and more creative freedom, the GoPro Max2 action camera is a strong choice for pros and casual users at $100 off, and a major upgrade over the original. But if you mainly want traditional action footage, often shoot in low-light conditions, and want longer battery life, the less-niche Hero line may suffice. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's not a quagmire I'd jump into willingly, but apparently, that's exactly what Android's about to do.According to \"images of internal builds\" seen by 9to5Google, Android's next update will add significant amounts of blur \"across Android 17.\"\"Throughout the OS, you can expect a system UI that switches from solid light or dark backgrounds to a blur effect that allows you to see what's immediately behind the component you're interacting with,\" writes 9to5Google's Abner Li.\nThat sounds a lot like Liquid Glass to me, and Li further confirms that elements like the volume bar and mode switcher will be translucent, allowing you to see your wallpaper and app icons in the background.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThis actually isn't Google's first time experimenting with transparency effects. In Android 16 QPR1, Google already added blur to the notification and quick settings panels. What's new is that we can now expect it in other parts of the OS as well, for a more cohesive look. So if it hasn't bothered you yet, you don't need to worry about opening your phone on Android 17's release date and seeing a brand new interface.Li also says that \"Compared to Liquid Glass on iOS, Android's new look is more subtle,\" although some are likely to be more sensitive to it than others.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPersonally, I haven't noticed the blur that's already there much, but even if you don't mind the aesthetic, the effect can be a slight drain on battery life. Luckily, even before it's been introduced across the OS at large, there's a way to turn off blur in Android.This came in Android QPR2, specifically as a response to the new effects (although it was technically available in developer options before then). To do this, open your Settings app, and then navigate to Accessibility > Color & Motion. From there, tap on Reduce blur effects. The change will take place immediately, so you'll be able to test then and there which look you prefer.Like other new Android features, the blur is likely to come to Pixels first, and because Google's branding it as part of its own Material 3 Expressive design language, it might not make the jump to Samsung Galaxy or other Android phones. The exception could be in Google-branded apps, although Li said \"it remains to be seen\" whether Google will add blur to its apps in addition to the OS.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Outages happen, of course, as anyone who has Verizon can attest. But in the moment, theories were flying left and right. TikTok had just officially moved into U.S. control, leading some to speculate that the outage had something to do with this change in ownership. As one user put it, \"TikTok being down days after the people they were forced to sell to take it over does not feel like a coincidence.\" As it happens, it does appear that the changing of the guard was responsible for the outage—just not in the way that some conspiracy theories might suggest. TikTok finally released a statement on X Monday morning, attributing the outage to issues at a U.S. data center. The statement is as follows: \"Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.\"   The outage might not be the only thing different about TikTokFor its part, TikTok is very much operational at the moment. If the issue really was just isolated to a power outage at this data center, that data center appears to have patched things up. But that doesn't mean the company's reputation is patched up. Users are accusing the app's new owners of changing the algorithm, complaining of reset For You Pages, irrelevant content in feeds, and AI-generated content. I've seen users accuse the app of blocking anti-Trump and anti-ICE content, while comedian Gianmarco Soresi says even some of his non-political TikToks have \"zero views,” which he attributes to the ineffectiveness of the people running the app. (I've reached out to TikTok for comment on user reports of changes to the algorithm and will update if I hear back.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWe'll need more time to know whether or not there were serious changes made to TikTok's algorithm and user feeds in the wake of this sale. But the app is running—at least, for now.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The move was supposed to be a boon for privacy, ensuring nobody could see your messages aside from the recipient and yourself. Even now, WhatsApp's website claims, \"No one outside of the chat, not even WhatsApp, can read, listen to, or share [your messages].\" However, a new lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco is now claiming that's not the case.According to reporting from Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has sued Meta, saying that the app's claims of end-to-end encryption are a lie. The lawsuit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \"store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp user's purportedly 'private' communications.\"The plaintiffs include users from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa, who are being represented by attorneys from several firms. The allegations cite \"whistleblowers\" who helped bring this information to light, but no more is known as of yet.\nWhen I reached out to Meta for comment, Meta strongly denied the allegations. The company called the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" assuring users that WhatsApp uses the open-source Signal protocol for encryption and adding that \"[a]ny claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf the lawsuit succeeds, it could affect billions of users around the world. That's because the plaintiffs' lawyers are asking the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.In the meantime, WhatApp is far from the only option for encrypted messaging apps. While it's unclear how the lawsuit will proceed, those looking to jump ship might want to look at alternatives like Signal or Viber instead. Note that some apps, like Telegram, do offer end-to-end encryption, but don't enable it by default. (Personally I use Line, because of the anime stickers.)\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's designed for casual, everyday use, like work, video streaming, and multitasking, rather than heavy multitasking or more demanding tasks like video editing, serious gaming, or 3D rendering. The CX1 has a 13-inch full HD touchscreen with sharp vision and lasts up to 11 hours on a single charge, based on usage.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsers get USB-C fast charging, fingerprint login, and a backlit keyboard. The laptop also features a 1080p webcam for calls and dual speakers, as it integrates well with Google services like Google Assistant voice control. It’s a no-frills, lightweight option (just over 3.5 lbs) that easily flips, and while it doesn’t have the fancy high-end specs and heavy performance capabilities of some Chromebooks, it’s a decent option that performs well and covers basics, which is more than generous for an under-$300 price tag. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Microsoft's flagship work suite, which includes tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook, is currently experiencing issues impacting users. It's not yet clear exactly why these problems are occurring, but according to Downdetector (owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis) thousands of users are reporting issues.There are any number of causes that could trigger a widespread outage like this, and in all likelihood, Microsoft will have the issue isolated and fixed soon—especially considering how many companies and users rely on Microsoft 365 to function. But it does follow a number of high-profile outages this week. Yesterday, Yahoo! and AOL were both down. Last week, X experienced an outage, as did Verizon—quite famously, I might add. And this morning, Instagram was also down.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut joining that list as well is none other than Microsoft itself. These services were all down yesterday, too, making this the second day in a row. Again, it's not clear why Microsoft is experiencing these issues, but while we wait for a fix, there's not much you can do on your end. If your Microsoft apps are acting up, you can try to work with any of the offline tools you have access to. If you have other means of communication other than Teams, run with that. There's nothing short of Microsoft issuing a patch on its end that will bring back online functionality here.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you’re always sore (or, worse, injured) after the first big storm of the season, read these tips on how to make shoveling easier on your body.Recognize what you’re asking your body to doLook, just because shoveling is a common chore doesn’t mean it’s one that everyone’s body is automatically ready for. Be honest about whether you’re trained for this. You wouldn’t ask “how can I run a marathon without my legs being sore the next day?” if you haven’t done any running at all in the past year. Jumping into something you’re not ready for is going to suck.If you know you’ll be shoveling a lot, plan ahead. Deadlifts in the gym will help you build the strength you need in your back, core, and legs, for example. If you’re not up for that, any full body fitness regime will leave you better prepared than doing nothing. \nAnd while we’re mostly talking about sore muscles and aching joints, it’s important to recognize whether your cardiovascular system is up to the task. If you aren’t used to exercising, and if you are older or have a heart condition, you may want to check with your doctor about whether shoveling poses a risk to your heart.Shovel early and oftenIf I could give the world only one snow-shoveling hack, it is this: Shovel when there is only a small amount of snow, even if you know there’s more coming. It’s far, far easier on your body to shovel three inches of snow four times over the course of the day, than to tackle 12 inches of snow all at once. If you missed your opportunity, you can still shovel in layers. Take a slice off the top, then a slice that goes deeper, and so on. Each shovelful will be much lighter and easier to deal with, even though you are taking more shovelfuls in total.Push instead of liftWe tend to envision shoveling as a repetitive bend-and-lift movement, but don’t forget that you can also use your shovel as a snowplow to push the snow in front of you. You can even buy shovels that are meant to be used this way, so consider an upgrade. Pushing the snow works best when it’s in a thin layer, so this works well with the advice to shovel when there’s only a small amount on the ground. But even if you have deep snow, pushing can save you some effort. Push until you have a pile, and then slice off the pile in layers.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep your back straightYou’ve heard the advice to lift heavy boxes “with your legs, not your back.” What this really means is that your back is best protected from injury when you can keep it straight. If your back rounds as it gets tired, take a break, or find a technique that allows you to keep your back straight even while it’s tired. For example, it’s most efficient to shovel in a deadlift-like motion: Your back is more or less straight, and you’re hingeing from your hips like a drinky bird. This does require a lot of work from your lower back muscles, so you are technically lifting “with your back,” but it’s safe as long as your back muscles are strong enough to keep your torso straight and stable. As your back muscles get tired, you may find it easier to keep your back straight if you keep it more upright. This is where a squat motion comes in—the proverbial lifting “with your legs.” Choke up on the shovel so the weight is as close to your body as possible, and bend your knees more so that you don’t have to bend as much from the hips.Warm up, take breaks, and go easy on yourselfDon’t kid yourself: This is a workout. And as with any workout, the first 10 to 15 minutes will feel the hardest. So keep the work light at first—take smaller shovelfuls, for example. Don’t forget to take breaks, either. You’re not cheating if you stop for a few minutes to let your body rest before getting back into it.Switching techniques (as above) and positions can help to distribute the strain across your body rather than just hammering the same muscles over and over. Do half your shoveling with the shovel on your right side, and half with the shovel to your left. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

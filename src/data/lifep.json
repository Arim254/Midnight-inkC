If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        As someone who regularly switches between the Mac and PC, I really can't live without the PowerToys app on Windows. It adds little missing features that I really like on the Mac, like a Spotlight Search alternative, auto dark mode, screen awake, on-screen OCR (which lets you pull text from images), and more.But the reverse is also true. When I'm on MacOS, I start to miss the little features and commands that I've been used to Windows having for decades now (I started using Windows in school, but was only exposed to macOS when I was in college).It's the little things, like not being able to cut and paste files in Finder. And why must I accidentally open the Music app every time I press the play button? This is just the beginning.\nEnter Supercharge, a utility from prolific indie developer Sindre Sorhus. Think of it not as a single app, but as a Swiss army knife for your menu bar—a collection of micro-utilities designed to patch the specific usability holes that Apple has left open, many of which Microsoft has already plugged. The app offers an unlimited free trial (with a prompt to upgrade every 12 hours), or you can buy it outright for $18. It's also available as part of a Setapp subscription. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Supercharge\n                    \n    \nThe best Supercharge tweaks that you should enableThe Supercharge app works in two ways. The first is by giving you a set-and-forget settings menu. Secondly, it adds a menu bar app where you can quickly access small features on the fly.The tweaks part, to me, is a lot more interesting. Once the app is installed, open the menu bar app and go to Settings. Go to the Tweaks tab and take some time to customize your Mac's behavior.Make Finder work more like Windows File Explorer\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe Finder is where Supercharge shines, fixing legacy behaviors that have frustrated Windows switchers for years. The first thing I enabled was the \"Cut and Paste\" functionality. Finally, you can use Cmd+X to cut a file and Cmd+V to move it, eliminating the awkward Cmd+C followed by Cmd+Option+V dance required by default.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nBeyond moving files, the app allows you to enable the Option+N shortcut to instantly create a new text file in your current folder—another Windows muscle memory I've had for decades. Additional tweaks include toggling the Enter key to open a file instead of renaming it, and an option to show hidden files by default.Mission Control featuresApple's Mission Control provides a bird's-eye view of all your windows, but it's hardly interactive. Supercharge changes that by adding window management buttons directly to the overlay. You can now add dedicated Close, Minimize, and Quit buttons for every window inside Mission Control, helping you clear cluttered app windows in seconds, and in a fairly visual way.Dock enhancementsSupercharge also brings much-needed flexibility to the Dock, making it more like the taskbar on Windows or Linux. Enable the Click-to-Hide feature, and you can minimize or hide an app simply by clicking on the app icon. My favorite, though, is the option to open folders directly in the Finder from the Dock. You can also set Supercharge to add spacers to the Dock, and quit apps using the middle-click mouse button.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Apple Music app fixPerhaps the most useful fix in the entire suite is the ability to stop Apple Music from launching automatically. This feature stops the app from popping up when you press Play on your keyboard or Bluetooth headphones. If you are a dedicated Spotify user or simply dislike it when your headphones accidentally wake up Apple Music, this feature alone makes a Supercharge installation worth it.Other useful featuresThe Supercharge app includes several other quality-of-life improvements. The Notification Nuke feature allows you to set a global hotkey to instantly clear all notifications from Notification Center, acting as a panic button for focus. To prevent accidents, you can also enable Accidental Quit Prevention, which requires a double-press or a Shift + Cmd + Q combo to actually quit an application.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe second part of the equation here is the menu bar app. Here, you can add small missing features that usually require downloading separate apps. There are more than two dozen options. Go to Settings > General > Show Menu Items to see the whole list.Here, you can add options to quickly capture and copy any text from an image (or translate it). There are one-click options for hiding all windows, showing the desktop, quitting all apps except the current one, clearing all notifications, and more. There's also a simple Keep Awake feature that will keep your Mac active even when the screen is off. And there's also a simple default browser switcher built-in, though I prefer using Sindre's dedicated Default Browser app.\n            ",

The wireless carrier's coverage was down for large swaths of the country for much of the day, leading to confusion, frustration, and, for some, conspiracy theories. I saw some users on X post cryptic messages like \"This is how it starts,\" and \"These are the end times.\" It's good to know in times of service disruption, we can all keep a level head. But despite claims to the contrary, the world didn't end yesterday, and Verizon fixed the issue. The company issued a statement at 10:20 p.m. ET, confirming the outage had been resolved, and that Verizon would contact affected customers directly to issue account credits. While that doesn't necessarily make up for a full day of network downtime, at least Verizon users can get back online and make calls when not connected to wifi.But some customers out there aren't back to normal. In fact, they're still seeing the same \"SOS\" alert on their phones they saw yesterday. For these users, the outage is very much still happening, as they cannot access the internet or communicate with others without either going through satellite connectivity, or finding a wifi connection. When you need to be out and about, especially on the road, that isn't an option. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nHow to get your Verizon phone out of SOS mode Luckily, there's a simple solution here, one that Verizon shared in its post about the outage's resolution: restart your phone. It doesn't matter if you already restarted your phone yesterday during the outage: In order to see results, you'll need to power off your phone and turn it back on after Verizon implemented its fix. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDifferent smartphones have different restart methods, but here are some tips for the most popular models:Restarting an iPhone: Press and hold one of the volume buttons together with the side (power) button, until you see the power-off slider. Slide to power off, then wait for the screen to go totally black. After about 30 seconds, you can press and hold the side button to power it back on. Note: If your iPhone has a Home button, you can simply press and hold the side button to pull up the power-off slider.  Restarting a Samsung Galaxy: Press and hold the volume down button and side button until you see power options appear. Here, choose \"Restart,\" then tap \"Restart\" again. Restarting a Pixel: If you have a Pixel 6 or newer, press and hold the volume up button and side button for a few seconds, then tap \"Restart\" when it appears. If you have a Pixel 5 or older, simply hold the side button until the phone restarts.If your phone model isn't listed here, you can search the internet for specific instructions on how to restart it. Typically, though, the process involves holding both the side button and one of the volume buttons.   \n            \n    ",

This update addresses 114 vulnerabilities in total, including three zero-days (bugs that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before an official fix is available from the developer). As reported by BleepingComputer, security flaws were found across the following categories: 57 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, three security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 22 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, 22 information disclosure vulnerabilities, two denial of service vulnerabilities, and five spoofing vulnerabilities. Six of the remote code execution vulnerabilities and two of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" Your machine should receive security updates automatically when Patch Tuesday drops, which is around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of the month. You can check to confirm by going to Start > Settings > Windows Update and selecting Check for Windows updates\nThree zero-days patched in JanuaryOne of the three zero-days fixed this month has been actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, labeled CVE-2026-20805, is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Desktop Windows Manager that allows attackers access to memory addresses from a remote ALPC port.

The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.If you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look. \n\n    \n            \n            There are plenty of categories to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.The home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to sign up for a MediaWiki account if you want to be able to contribute to the site too.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nHover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.Click through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Each movie comes with a cast list.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.Obviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.Free movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments. The scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic). \nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nA nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBetterment data hackedCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. If you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whereas before such software was either clumsy or expensive, there are now all kinds of great open source tools that work well.Which brings me to Pipit, a free Mac dictation app that works offline, meaning it's totally private. Even more interesting, it can be used to do more than just transcribe speech—it can launch apps, toggle settings, and even launch a web search or query an AI service.The first time you open the application, it will ask for permission to use your microphone before downloading the Parakeet model for offline transcription. Once everything is set up you can use the application by pressing and holding the Option key, then talking—the application will record what you say, turn that into text, and paste the text into the currently active text field.\nI've been trying this for a couple of days and find that the transcriptions are generally pretty accurate, complete with punctuation. There is optional post-processing, which can turn unstructured speech into a properly formatted document, but using that requires an OpenRouter API key.The settings window lets you change the trigger key, choose an input device, and toggle the menu bar icon. There's also a tool for transcribing audio files, complete with speaker identification. Just drag over a file and you get a transcription.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            The uploads screen for Pipit, allowing you to transcribe audio files.\n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nFinally, on the Enhance tab, you can enable the Quick Actions feature. This allows you to verbally tell your computer what to do and see it happen. To use this, start transcription as normal, but say something like \"open Safari\" to open an app or \"ask Claude\" followed by a question to launch a conversation with that AI assistant in your browser. It's a little gimmicky, granted, but I enjoyed using it.\n    \n            \n            The voice commands you can use with Pipit, as seen in the settings.\n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's excellent that tools like this are broadly free now, and Pipit has an interesting collection of features. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make. Despite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.  Parents can still supervise their 13 year olds' Google Accounts Luckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\") \nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSpeaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does this mean for my child's Google Account?As I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.But now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end. It's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same. \n            \n    ",

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications. Maybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.The application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).The whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.It's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.I don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.\"The company also posted an acknowledgement over on X, while on popular service interruption tracking website Downdetector (which is owned by the same parent company as Lifehacker), user reports of problems have been coming in steadily since about noon. They reached a peak of over 170,000 reports at around 12:50 EST, and while they've dropped steadily since then, the latest update at time of writing still saw over 60,000 reports of problems.\nI'm a Verizon customer, but my phone seems to be unaffected for now, even if I turn my wifi off and rely purely on my cell signal. That's a bit surprising, as according to Downdetector, the areas with the most reports include both New York City (likely meaning Manhattan) and Brooklyn, which would include where I'm located. Other areas reporting major disruptions include Charlotte, N.C.; Houston; Atlanta; Dallas; Philadelphia; Miami; and Ashburn, Va.As for which services are impacted, 61% of reports only point out mobile phone problems in general, but 35% of reports specifically complain about a lack of signal, while 4% report issues with mobile internet.You'll know if you're affected if your signal strength is low, which is usually indicated by four vertical bars in the top-right corner of your phone. Your phone might also display that it's in \"SOS\" Mode. This does not mean that you or your phone are in any danger, but rather, that signal is only present for contacting emergency services like 911.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, the best you can do while the outage is resolved is probably wait, although if you're connected to wifi and are still having issues calling or texting, you could try an alternative messaging app like WhatsApp, as well as ensure that wifi calling is enabled on your phone. The loss of cell service should mostly affect those relying on data from cell towers, rather than those connected to an internet router.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile Verizon is facing the brunt of user reports, T-Mobile and AT&T are also seeing their own share of outage complaints over on Downdetector. Some of these may be a case of confusion, however. On X, T-Mobile said that its network \"is operating normally and as expected,\" but that some customers may still face issues, specifically if they're trying to reach someone on a Verizon plan. AT&T posted similar sentiments, albeit with a more aggressive tone.Meanwhile, city governments are issuing their own warnings. An emergency AlertDC notification sent to Washington D.C. residents said, \"If you have an emergency and can not connect using your Verizon Wireless device, please connect using a device from another carrier, a landline, or go to a police district or fire station to report the emergency.\" While the city's advice is understandable, as it wants to prepare readers for a worst possible scenario, it's worth reiterating that, for emergency calls, phones can use any viable nearby network. If you are a Verizon customer and you need immediate help from 911, it's still best to attempt reaching out over the phone (or even text, depending on your area) before taking the extra time to visit emergency services in person. As a reminder, connecting to wifi and enabling wifi calling can help with this.As for New York, it's taking a more measured approach with its messaging. New York City's Office of Emergency Management posted to X that it is aware of the outage and that the government is \"working closely with our partners\" to asses possible impacts.\n            \n    ",

That was due to Verizon's nationwide outage, which impacted roughly two million customers across the United States. If you were among them, you couldn't use your phone when you were on the go, which is sort of the idea behind cellphones in general. This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send emails or messages for work, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or, perhaps because of it) the company does seem keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced that it had resolved the outage yesterday evening, it also noted that it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowAt 9:42 a.m. ET, Verizon made a new post on X, once again apologizing for yesterday's issues, and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer to making up for what happened. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive. If you're among them, Verizon says you can log into the myVerizon app to claim your recompense.        \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And the skincare \"It Girl\" of the moment? It's salmon sperm. Yeah.As we kick off the new year—prime time for beauty resolutions!—a growing number of people are seeking out \"salmon sperm facials.\" Before your imagination paints an extra fishy picture (pun intended), understand that people aren't really smearing straight-up salmon sperm on their face. The secret ingredient is something called PDRN, or polydeoxyribonucleotide, a compound extracted from salmon DNA. So, what exactly is this secret ingredient, and is it truly the next frontier in anti-aging skincare?The science behind the hypePDRN isn't totally snake oil; the compound has legitimate clinical backing for its regenerative properties. Research suggests that PDRN can stimulate tissue repair, promote collagen production, and improve skin elasticity by activating adenosine receptors in cells. Several sources claim it's been used in medical applications since the 1980s in Italy and South Korea. Whatever the actual origins, PDRN has gradually made its way into mainstream skincare.\n\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThe treatment typically involves a series of micro-injections delivered directly into the skin, similar to mesotherapy or microneedling procedures. In the U.S., however, PDRN is only legal to use topically, since the FDA qualifies it as a beauty product and not a drug. Proponents claim it can reduce fine lines, improve skin texture, minimize scarring, and create an overall more youthful appearance. Unlike other cosmetic procedures that simply fill or temporarily plump the skin, PDRN is said to actually stimulate the skin's natural healing processes. But as always, there's a significant gap between reality and what you see online. The reality checkSocial media thrives on transformation narratives, and skincare content is no exception. The algorithms favor dramatic reveals, leading creators to emphasize stunning results while downplaying less glamorous details—like the fact that these injections can be quite painful according to some. \"While PDRN has legitimate clinical data supporting skin repair and regeneration,\" says Dr. Claudia Kim, \"viral content often exaggerates results and glosses over who is—and isn't—an appropriate candidate. Context and medical supervision matter.\" When it comes to the injections specifically, these treatments can cause temporary swelling and bruising. At the very least, they could require multiple sessions to see results. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAgain: If you're in the U.S., and there's a syringe full of salmon sperm headed straight for you, it might not be FDA-approved. That means its purity, safety, and effectiveness are not regulated. As with any medical aesthetic procedure, you shouldn't sign up for PDRN treatments without careful consideration—considerations that extend beyond the promise of better skin. Do you know which salmon DNA procedure you're signing up for? Is it an injection, or is it technically microneedling? Did you opt for PDRN or PN (polynucleotides), a purer and more concentrated form of PDRN? To make things even more confusing, these treatments can go by different names, from “salmon skin facials,” to “salmon sperm injections,” or “PDRN facials” to the brand name Rejuran. One thing is sure: As demand grows, so does the risk of unqualified practitioners offering the treatment, potentially leading to complications or disappointing results.The bottom lineThe salmon sperm trend may sound bizarre, but there is science backing it up. And when your favorite beauty influencer credits their glowing skin to a specific treatment, it's tempting to believe you can achieve the same results. Social media will always continue to drive beauty trends, and there's nothing inherently wrong with being inspired by what you see online. But for your looks and your safety, you need to understand the difference between a carefully curated social media moment and the full reality of medical aesthetic procedures.If you're intrigued by PDRN treatments after seeing them online, consult with a qualified dermatologist or licensed aesthetic practitioner. They can assess whether you're an appropriate candidate, explain realistic expectations, discuss potential side effects, and ensure the treatment is administered safely. As more advanced treatments become increasingly accessible and visible online, don't let TikTok influencers replace professional medical consultation. \n            \n    ",

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

Do you wish you could take care of all those updates at once? Updatest is an application made for exactly this.I've talked about Homebrew for Mac, which is a command line tool for installing and updating Mac software. Updatest scans all the software on your computer and updates it using Homebrew, even if you didn't initially install it that way. But there's more. Many applications use an open source tool called Sparkle to offer updates, and Updatest can find and update all of them. The application can also identify applications downloaded from GitHub that have newer releases, along with any application you downloaded from the Mac App Store.Basically, if an application has updates, Updatest can find them and install them for you. To get started, click the download button on the app's website (you can also install using Homebrew, if you've already set that up). The application will tell you a bit about how it works, ask you which categories of applications you want to update using the tool, and offer to install Homebrew if you haven't done that already.\nOnce you're done with all of that, you will see a list of all the applications on your system. You can filter to see only the apps that need updates, if you want.Click any application to learn more about the update. From here you can install the update. Alternatively, you can click the Bulk Update button below the search bar to update all of your outdated applications at once. You can watch the updates happen by clicking the Terminal button in the top-right corner, or you can let the application do its thing while you work on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome updates require passwords, in which case you'll be asked to run the update command in the Terminal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd in some cases, applications from the Mac App Store won't update—in my tests, this was mostly iPad apps I've installed. The application will instead give you a link to open the App Store and install the update.These minor annoyances are inevitable, and not too burdensome. And it's nice to be able to check all of my applications for updates in once place. If you're interested, there's a 15-day free trial, allowing you to get a feel for how the application works. After that you can buy a personal license, which works on up to three Macs, for $9.99; a household license, which works on up to 10 Macs, costs $19.99.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

They're also often low quality, AI-generated, misinformation, or some combination of the bunch, and may have a negative impact on our attention spans and mental health. In short, they're just not that good for us. It's bad enough for grown adults to control their scrolling habits, but it's another thing entirely for children, which poses quite the a challenge.It's easy enough to ban short-form video apps entirely, like TikTok. But what about apps that have short-form content as just one pillar of the overall package? Take YouTube: You might not mind your child having limited access to the app or site to watch long-form content you approve of, but having Shorts always in the way throws a wrench in that system. Any type of short-form video feed would be an issue here, but YouTube Shorts is particularly egregious, allowing kids to watch some truly horrific content, often generated by AI. Choosing whether your kids watch YouTube ShortsLuckily, YouTube finally appears to be giving parents some control here. As spotted by TechCrunch, YouTube announced updates to its parental controls on Wednesday. While there are a few changes on the way, the headline for me concerns Shorts. Not only will YouTube let parents choose a timer for how often their kids can watch Shorts, they can choose to set the timer to zero—effectively blocking Shorts for their kids' and teens' accounts. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThis should be welcome news to any parents struggling to limit the short-form video content their kids are watching. You can let them watch other types of videos on YouTube Kids, or even standard YouTube if its a teen account, without worrying about them going down short-form video rabbit holes for hours. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe control here can be even more granular than an outright ban, too. Since you're always in control of the timer, YouTube says you can customize timers based on the scenario: You could set the Shorts timer to zero during homework time, then offer 30 minutes of scrolling after dinner. You could bump that to 60 minutes on weekends, or when in the car. If your child is under a supervised account, you'll also be able to control both custom Bedtime and \"Take a Break\" reminders. This is not the first time YouTube has offered users more control over Shorts. Last week, the company rolled out a new search filter that lets you choose to only see long-form videos in any given result, and since October, you've been able to limit the number of shorts you can watch in a day. YouTube, and parent company Google, are also expanding parental controls and enhancing protections for kids and teens. YouTube now uses AI to guess your age, and, if it believes you're under 18, will add restrictions to your account. Google also gives parents more control over supervised accounts: Previously, teens could choose to remove supervision after turning 13, but now, they need their parents to sign off on it too.     \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This is a QLED Mini LED TV, so while it's not at the quality that OLED TVs can offer, it makes up for it with a much lower price. Right now, the 65-inch Hisense Class U6 Series TV is $529.96 (originally $847.99), the lowest price it has been, according to price-checking tools.\nDon't let the budget price fool you; this is a quality TV. The best one of 2025, according to PCMag's \"outstanding\" review. Its main attributes are its incredible levels of brightness, peaking at 1,024 nits, and its beautiful colors. This is expected from a QLED Mini LED TV, but not for under $550 for a 65-inch TV. It is also packed with features and specs that you won't find in other TVs at this price.The refresh rate is 144Hz with VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, making it a good option to play games. You'll get an input lag of 4.6 ms at 1080p and 13.1 ms at 4K. For those who pay premium in their streaming apps for HDR, you'll be able to take advantage of HDR10+ and Dolby Vision IQ. If you have a surround sound system, you'll also be able to take advantage of Dolby Atmos for a more immersive, 3D sound.The biggest downside, in my opinion, is that the OS is Amazon’s Fire TV, but that's fixable with a TV stick, and also down to preference.

Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I know I have done a poor job of keeping track of media as I have upgraded computers and phones over the years, and I've lost my fair share of photos, videos, and documents along the way, whether on misplaced or damaged external drives or from simply forgetting to back up at all. Here's how to ensure your data is available for years to come. \nYou need multiple backups of your dataOne approach to backing up your data is the 3-2-1 strategy, which says you should keep three copies of your data across two different forms of storage, one of which should be offsite (in case a disaster strikes your home). A simple example: You have your photos and files on your computer, which is backed up regularly to both an external hard drive and a cloud service. That's three copies of your data on two storage types—an onsite physical device and remote cloud storage—the latter of which satisfies the \"offsite\" requirement because it is geographically separate from your other two copies. This approach protects against a single point of failure, such as a primary device dying, losing an external hard drive, or getting locked out of a cloud account. When it comes to backing up your data, redundancy matters. As Reddit users note, there are different interpretations of how to apply the 3-2-1 rule, such as whether your working copy on your primary device counts as one of three and whether the one offsite copy is included in the two forms of storage. And while a strict 3-2-1 strategy, or variations of it, may be more commonly employed at the enterprise level rather than by the average consumer, you could think about it as a general guideline for improving your backup system, especially if you don't have one at all. How to set up backupsYou never know when a device might fail, so it's a good idea to plan frequent backups, whether your data is syncing regularly to the cloud or you set reminders to manually push updates to your external hard drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany users sync their devices automatically to a service like iCloud or Google Drive, but relying on this as your sole backup doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to access all of your files in the future. As HowtoGeek points out, these backups are typically mirroring what's currently on your device rather than historical versions—so once you delete a photo, file, or folder from your computer or phone, it's also deleted from the cloud backup. This is useful for quick access as well as restoring to a new or factory-reset device, but it doesn't do much for the scores of media collected over the years that you don't use daily. You could use a dedicated cloud backup service like IDrive or Backblaze, which come with a lot of storage space for automatic, full device backups. This may be best for users who have large files or a lot of media that is essential to their jobs as well as those who prioritize data privacy. (However, Wirecutter notes that most online backup services leave a lot to be desired.) Others may be fine to manually move files and media to free or low-cost cloud storage, including iCloud, OneDrive, and Google. At a minimum, another backup should live on an external hard drive—and if you're not going to do cloud backups, consider two external drives stored in separate locations. Hardware can obviously be lost, stolen, damaged, or simply degraded over time, so again, you shouldn't rely on a single drive for all of your storage. Apple's Time Machine and Windows File History make it easy to save backups to an external drive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Opening your statement to see expensive charges you didn't make is stressful, and canceling your card—and dealing with all of your attached subscriptions—is a nightmare. So if you get a call about an unauthorized charge for a brand new iPhone, you're probably going to want to get to the bottom of it. Here's the thing: It's likely a scam. I speak from experience: My wife keeps getting calls from unknown numbers, all of which leave voicemails about charges for iPhones. The voicemail starts off with what sounds like standard holding music. Suddenly, a voice pops in, saying something to the affect of: \"This is Amazon. This call is to authorize the payment of $999 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 16 Pro on your account. If you do not authorize this payment, please press \"one\" to speak to our customer support representative.\" Your call may also be about, \"the payment of $1,099 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 17 Pro on your account.\" We are inundated with the calls, and besides the payment amount and the specific iPhone model, the rest of the message is identical. As you might expect, no such charges are actually present on either our Amazon account or in our credit card history. That's because no one bought an iPhone in our name, or by using our financial information: This was simply a scam.\nHad we answered the phone and pressed \"one\" to speak with a \"customer support representative,\" or called the number back after listening to the voicemail, this is what would have likely happened: The \"representative\" would have assured us that they would be able to dispute the charge, but of course they'd need some information from us first. Perhaps they would have needed us to confirm the credit card information, and would ask us to read our digits out loud. Maybe they'd need to make sure we actually owned the Amazon account in question, and would ask for our two-factor authentication code to \"confirm our identity.\" No matter what the case, the scammers would have been praying on our concern about the charge to extract some type of sensitive information from us, all for their own financial gain. Had we called back and complied, we would have almost assuredly handed the scammers the money we thought they were helping us get back.  What to do if you get this voicemailIf you get a voicemail like this, don't call them back. If you pick up the phone, and you get this message, don't press \"one;\" just hang up. You are definitely being scammed, and there's no risk in simply ignoring the caller completely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you'd like to verify their claims, don't involve the caller at all. Instead, head to your Amazon account, and check your order history. You'll be able to see if any such iPhones were ordered under your account—and, if they were, you can cancel the order here. Similarly, check your credit card history: If you don't see a charge for an iPhone, there wasn't one. If you do see one, reach out to the credit card company directly through their official contact information.  Scammers rely on pressure tactics that stress you out, and make you feel like time is of the essence. It rarely ever is. While it might seem common practice for companies like Amazon to call customers about large charges, it really isn't. If you ever receive unsolicited communications from someone claiming to represent a company you belong to, you can always end the conversation, and reach out directly yourself. If you contact Amazon's official customer support, or the company that issues your credit card, they'll be able to confirm or deny the claim for you.  While you can block the number, it might not do much good. Each time we've received a call, it's been from a different number, so my guess is they're not reusing numbers when calling you back. Instead, you should strongly consider using one of Apple's built-in anti-spam tools. If you're running iOS 26, you can choose to have your iPhone screen calls from unknown numbers, and ask for information before sending the call your way. No matter which version of iOS you have, you can also choose to silence unknown callers en masse, so you're never interrupted by any caller that isn't in your contacts. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It saves me a lot of money and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

If you tried to follow your feeds on X, or engage with ChatGPT, you were only met with error messages. Compare those error messages to one another, however, and you'd likely notice a similar name affixed to them all: Cloudflare. Cloudflare's massive Tuesday morning outage had sweeping implications for much of the web. While it's not clear what caused the outage at this time, we do know whether the outage was responsible for a website's downtime. (When an error page says \"Cloudflare: Error,\" it's not difficult to track down the source of the problem.) As Cloudflare offers web infrastructure services to a huge number of sites, the true list of affected sites is likely massive. As an example, I wanted to convert the timezone Cloudflare uses in its status reports, UTC, to ET, and the first website I clicked on in my Google search returned an error. While there's no central repository listing each and every affected website, we can look at the sites with the largest number of user reports indicating issues this morning through Downdetector. (Disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Lifehacker.) Ironically, Downdetector itself was down this morning—it too uses Cloudflare.\nDowndetector is not a service that investigates and reports websites that are down. Instead, users can self-report issues with sites on Downdetector. As such, it can be illuminating to see which sites visitors were having issues with during the period of time Cloudflare was down. At this time, that includes the following:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nXCloudflareOpenAIChatGPTGrindrArchive of Our OwnAWSSpotifyLeague of LegendseClinicalWorksQuizletUberCharacter.aiCanvaClaudeVaroIndeedProcoreTruth SocialFanFictionArloDoorDashValorantRunescapeDayforceNJTransitSniffiesSquareGoogleZoomRoverCollegeBoardLetterboxd  Bet365MoneyLionDayZBetMGMYouTubeMicrosoftIKEASunoMicrosoft 365Canvas by InstructureMicrosoft TeamsAmazonGrokInstagramGeminiAgain, this list is not definitive, nor is it official.

When I tried to load sites like X, ChatGPT, or, ironically, Downdetector, I was met with various errors. X showed me an internal service error, while Downdetector asked me to \"Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.\" (I definitely do not have that authority.) You may experience similar errors on websites you try to load this morning, even ones you don't regularly visit. As part of this article, for example, I would google queries and click the top results to websites I had never heard of before, only to encounter similar error messages. That's because a large portion of the global internet relies on Cloudflare to operate. Cloudflare offers a host of services to companies, including web infrastructure and cybersecurity products. As such, when Cloudflare goes down, so do many of those websites—a bit of a domino effect.\nIt's not clear at this time what brought on the outage, but, as spotted by Techradar, Cloudflare had announced scheduled maintenance for some of its web servers for Nov. 18, ranging from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. UTC (7am to 10am ET), so it's possible something happened during this work to break service. The good news is, it appears that many of these sites are back up and running—at least, at this time. At 8:09 a.m. ET, Cloudflare reported it had identified the issue, and was working on a fix. At 9:42 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it rolled out the fix, and that the company believes the incident is resolved—though the official status page still says the Cloudflare Global Network is experiencing issues. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile this is indeed a big interruption to the internet, it's far from the first time this has happened. In fact, an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage broke the internet last month. With the Cloudflare outage this morning, it's an example of the risks of so many companies putting their web services needs in the same basket: If one servicer goes, so too goes a huge fraction of the web. Cloudflare will likely patch this issue sometime Tuesday, so I imagine we'll all be back to business as usual soon enough. I'll keep this article updated with developments as they come. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In its November fraud and scam advisory, Google is warning users about VPN apps and extensions that appear legitimate but are actually vectors for malware.VPNs may actually be spyware A VPN, or virtual private network, makes your internet activity much more difficult to track by routing your traffic through a different connection rather than your regular internet service provider (ISP). This allows you to hide your IP address and location, obscure your browsing data, and protect your information and devices from bad actors. According to Google, malicious VPNs (posing as real ones) are delivering infostealers, remote access trojans, and banking trojans to user devices once installed, allowing hackers to access sensitive personal data like browsing history, financial credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet information. This means that an app you rely on to keep your information private could be doing the exact opposite. Cybercriminals are capitalizing on user trust in these services, creating apps that look and feel like legitimate VPNs but are actually dangerous spyware. \nHow to ensure your VPN app is safeAs with any app or extension, only download or install a VPN from an official source like the Google Play store. While malicious programs do sometimes sneak through, it's typically safer and more reliable than sideloading through a messaging app or other unvetted site. In January 2025, Google launched a VPN verification process to help users identify trustworthy VPN apps in the Google Play store. To earn a \"verified\" badge, VPN apps have to undergo a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation and opt into independent security reviews. Badges are awarded only to VPNs that have been published for at least 90 days and reach 10,000 installs and 250 user reviews. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, this system isn't perfect either: As TechRadar reported earlier this year, a popular (free) Chrome VPN extension earned a badge and was later discovered to be spying on users. That's why you should rely on a reputable VPN service—which means you'll likely have to pay for it. Free VPNs are far more likely to a privacy nightmare, and any app that sounds too good to be true probably is. You aren't going to get unlimited traffic at no cost without sacrificing something. Finally, review VPN permissions carefully, and allow the minimum access possible for the app or extension to function. (You should do this with any app you download, and you should audit apps regularly to remove unnecessary permissions.) You can check your VPN service's support pages to find out which permissions are essential—this should not include access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or photos, for example. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In macOS 26 Tahoe, Apple's shipped a bunch of ways to customize the look and feel of your Mac's desktop, app icons, and menu bar, among other things. And there's more to it than just tweaking how Liquid Glass looks. If you're the sort of person who enjoys theming and customization, try these tips.Tweak app icons in the Dock\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYour Mac's Dock probably has a bunch of colorful icons. I've always enjoyed those diverse colors, but others might want something more uniform. If you feel like going with a particular tint, or if you just want your app icons to use dark mode, it's just a quick tweak away. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and go to System Settings > Appearance > Icon & widget style. Here, you can change the app icons to Dark, Clear, or Tinted. The Tinted option lets you select a single tint for all your app icons, so choose the color you like the most.Customize the clock in your Mac's lock screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOnce you upgrade to macOS Tahoe, you'll probably notice the new clock on your lock screen. You can tweak this to your liking, too. Just go to System Settings > Wallpaper > Clock Appearance. You can choose one of six clock styles. Don't forget to adjust the slider below the Weight option, which lets you change the font to make the clock look sleeker or more prominent.\nCustomize the Control Center\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWith iOS 18's release in 2024, Apple started letting you customize your iPhone's Control Center. This year, that feature is finally on Mac, starting with macOS Tahoe. To use it, just click the Control Center button in the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen, and select Edit Controls. There are plenty of controls to choose from, so take your time and add what you need. You can drag-and-drop any of the controls to move them around, or you can click the - (minus) button next to any control to remove it from the Control Center. Alternatively, you can tweak your control center under System Settings > Menu Bar > Menu Bar Controls.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOne of the more controversial changes to macOS Tahoe is the swap to a transparent menu bar. The clear color sometimes makes it harder to read text, but if you don't like that, you can restore a background to your menu bar. This feature is under System Settings > Menu Bar > Show menu bar background.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChange folder icon colors on Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're tired of the default blue color for folder icons, macOS Tahoe lets you tweak this to suit your style. Go to System Settings > Appearance > Folder color and use the drop-down menu to change the color of folder icons. I'd have never thought of myself as a person who uses orange folder icons, but I suppose we all go through a tangerine season at some point in our lives.Switch Mac theme in Settings\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nmacOS Tahoe also gives you limited control over your Mac's theme. If you go to System Settings > Appearance > Theme and pick a color, you'll notice that this color also applies to the cursor in writing apps, and the color of selected items in menus, too. On the same menu page, you can also choose a different color for highlighted text, which is a nice additional level of customization. It ensures that if I pick a particularly bright color for my overall theme, I can still choose a milder color for text selection. That helps me stay focused while I'm working, which is something I value a lot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The app picks up on your interests quickly, and before you know it, you're falling down an hours-deep rabbit hole every time you launch it. But the algorithm doesn't always get it right: Sometimes, you end up seeing too much of one type of content, no matter how many times you hit \"Not Interested.\" With the rise of AI-generated content, this problem only gets more frustrating. AI video generators like Sora are empowering people to produce more hyperrealistic AI slop than ever, which means you've likely encountered it on your feeds—whether you know it or not. I've certainly laughed at some AI clips here and there, but for the most part, I can't stand coming across them in the wild. And they aren't just a nuisance, they can be legitimately dangerous—some have even tricked users into installing malware on their smartphones. As this content become more normalized, I worry for our collective ability to spot misinformation across our social media platforms, so whenever you can take a step to reducing or removing this content from your feeds, I encourage you to do so.  \nAnd as it happens, TikTok is now experimenting with a tool to help you control the AI slop on your For You Page. Per a Wednesday press release, the company says it will roll out the new option in the existing \"Manage topics\" menu of the app's settings page. Manage topics already lets you finely tune parts of your individual TikTok algorithm to show you more of one subject or less of another—you can manage things like creative arts, current affairs, dance, fashion and beauty, food and drinks, health and fitness, humor, lifestyle, nature, pets, sports, travel. Soon, the section will add a slider for AI-generated content as well, if the option isn't live for you already. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to limit AI slop in TikTokTikTok says this new option is rolling out \"in the coming weeks,\" which is unfortunately vague. I don't have the option, even after installing the latest version of TikTok. However, that also means it could hit your app at any time. When it does, here's how to use it:Open TikTok, then tap \"Profile\" in the bottom right.Tap the hamburger menu icon in the top right, then choose \"Settings and privacy.\" Under \"Content & Display,\" choose \"Content preferences,\" then choose \"Manage topics.\"When the option is available on your app, adjust the \"AI-generated content\" slider. Move it left to see less AI-generated content, or move it right to see more of this content. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to completely remove AI content from your TikTok feed. Hopefully with this slider in place, however, you'll greatly reduce the amount of AI content you see, to the point where it's effectively gone entirely. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There are Chromebooks with OLED screens, high refresh rates, and even light-up keyboards, but no matter how many bells and whistles you slap on a Chromebook, it's still not going to have nearly as much raw processing power as a more traditional laptop.That's where cloud gaming comes in. This lets you stream games from the cloud, if you're willing to put up with a certain amount of video compression and input delay. One of the most popular cloud gaming services is Nvidia's GeForce Now, which lets you play select free-to-play titles and PC games you already own using the company's own data centers. The catch is that you either have to watch ads or pay up—but today, Google's Chromebooks are getting an exclusive new tier of GeForce Now that fixes both of these issues.Called GeForce Now Fast Pass, this version of GeForce Now is sort of like an expanded version of the existing free tier. You'll still be limited to playing at 1080p and 60fps—higher specs will require you to pay—and you won't have access to GeForce Now's \"Install-to-Play\" games, which means the library of compatible titles will be closer to 2,000 than 4,000. But unlike the free tier, you won't have to watch any ads, and you won't have to wait in a queue to start playing. Nvidia says the typical free-tier queue is only two minutes long, but hey, the sooner you can hop into the action, the better.\nStarting today, all new Chromebook purchases will come with a free year of GeForce Now Fast Pass, but there are some caveats. The big one is that you only get 10 free Fast Pass hours per month, although up to five unused hours will roll over to the next month.That means you'll still have to keep track of your time while playing, even if you don't have to watch ads. A Google spokesperson told me over email that once your Fast Pass hours are up, you'll be downgraded to the basic, ad-supported free tier, or you can purchase more Fast Pass hours a la carte. I wasn't told exactly how much these hours will cost, but given that a day pass (meaning 24 hours of play) of GeForce Now with no ads and higher specs than Fast Pass costs just $3.99, I can't imagine they'll be too expensive.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for when your year of Fast Pass is over, I'm still waiting for an answer on how to renew. I'll update this post once I hear back. I've also asked whether users that already have Chromebooks will be able to sign up for GeForce Now Fast Pass.One last bonus for Fast Pass, though, is that you don't have to actually use it on your Chromebook. You'll need a Chromebook to sign up (I'm also still waiting on exact steps for that), but once you've redeemed the offer, you'll be able to use it on any GeForce Now compatible device, like a phone or tablet.Overall, it doesn't exactly seem like something I'd go out of my way to buy a Chromebook for, but it could be a decent way to get good enough performance to play through about one short game per month, all without having to pay for GeForce Now or deal with ads or wait times. Combine that with the free games that sites like Epic give out on a regular basis, and you could essentially game casually for a year without buying anything other than your Chromebook. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFinally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I noticed a few days ago that it has a new feature: A research function divided into \"fast research\" and \"deep research.\" After playing around with it a little, these new features seem to completely defeat the purpose of why I started using NotebookLM in the first place—with one big exception. What the new \"fast research\" and \"deep research\" options in NotebookLM doIn short, \"fast research\" and \"deep research\" make NotebookLM work a lot like other AI tools—they pull information in from the web on your behalf—and that's the primary reason I don't see myself using them.\nWhen you use the deep research tool, you enter in what you want to research as a topic in the left panel, where you also typically store all the PDFs, links, and other materials you manually inputted as the sources for NotebookLM to pull from. This is where it differs from the premise NotebookLM has basically been built on since it was launched: The software searches the internet for sources, broadening the selection of materials the generated quizzes, podcasts, summaries, and flashcards will pull from. Before this update, it was entirely on you to find and input your own sources. The fast research tool is similar. Instead of finding the sources and generating a long report, it just suggests a handful of new sources for you to consider. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhether using deep or fast research mode, you have the option to deselect sources if you don't like them, but it's tricky to review them. I tried it on a Notebook I have set up to study for my upcoming personal training certification exam. It spit out a selection of titles like \"Free NASM Practice Test,\" shown above on the left. I had to click the \"7 more links\" link to expand the panel, which then revealed where the sources were from and gave me the chance to open them in a new tab to review them before agreeing to import them (shown on the right). Finding and assessing sources on my own is a crucial first step in my learning and brainstorming process, so I don't see myself ever using this. The reason I love using NotebookLM is that it doesn't do the work for me. It's still my responsibility to go out and find all the sources I need, then input them so it can help me synthesize the contents. I use it for studying, for work, and to organize my personal projects. None of those things benefit much from random outside sourcing. And, as is a risk with all AI tools, there's no guarantee it will find sources that are credible (again, it found me a Reddit thread I could have easily found for myself). The one useful new feature in the NotebookLM updateWhen you're inputting the topic you want NotebookLM to research, you'll notice a dropdown menu. It's automatically set to \"Web,\" meaning it will pull sources from the internet, but you can also set it to go through your Google Drive instead. That is helpful. I keep everything related to all my projects in distinct Drive folders already. Using this feature can help me input all the relevant materials when I need them instead of having to add them in manually, one by one. That's the sort of utility I have been enjoying NotebookLM for over the past few months.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        As it does every year, Google has picked its favorite apps, games, and books of 2025 from the Play Store catalog—and the annual selection is always useful as a pointer towards some high-quality titles for your Android devices that you may have missed so far.Topping the pile is Focus Friend from YouTuber Hank Green, which aims to keep you on task and undistracted via a series of cutesy animations and cartoon living spaces. The less you check your phone, the better the experience for your 'bean' inside the app.It's an app we've written about before, and I've given it a go myself while trying to focus on writing this article with as few distractions as possible. I've also cast an eye over the other picks from Google, which you may want to add to your phone or tablet.\nFocus Friend really does help you focusI'd previously heard a bit of buzz around Focus Friend, but it being picked as Google's favorite Play Store app of the year gave me the nudge I needed to actually install it and give it a go. It's been earning some rave reviews, but it's not actually all that different to the many other focus apps available on mobile.This one does ramp up the cartoon cuteness, giving you your own personal bean character who will get busy knitting as long as you're not checking other apps on your phone. You can trade the socks that get knitted for a variety of furnishings and decorations for the bean's living space, which starts off very bare indeed.\n    \n            \n            Focus Friend is built around a timer system.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's a well-implemented app that's straightforward and fun to use, and I found it did encourage me to pick up my phone less. There's a pro version—yours for $2 a month—which unlocks access to more items for your bean to knit and more decorations for the surrounding room.I like that you don't even have to sign up for an account to use the app (a constant bind if you write about tech and apps all day), and there's a decent amount of customization here—you've got sound effects and music you can turn on and off, the option to actually block other apps, and a lock screen mode to make use of.\n    \n            \n            The app offers a variety of customization options.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour mileage may vary depending on how taken you are with the bean character and the various items you can get to kit out its room. This is essentially just a stopwatch with a lot of nice dressing around it, and you can get much the same effect by starting a timer on your phone—without worrying about hurting the feelings of an imaginary bean.It's a good pick by Google, but it's also fair to say there are lots of similar apps out there. I actually prefer Forest (for Android or iOS), which grows a little forest for you rather than having a bean knit socks, but my favorite app of this type is Focus Traveller (only available on iOS, sadly for Android users) that turns your focus sessions into cross-country hikes.More apps, games, and ebooksThere's plenty more in Google's list besides Focus Friend—and I'll confess I haven't used many of these apps or games. The best multi-device app award goes to Luminar, a comprehensive photo editing tool that's packed with tools (and AI, as you would expect). The interface adapts really well across devices, including foldables and Chromebooks.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other apps that made the list are Instagram app Edits (best for fun), audiobook summarizer Wiser (best everyday essential), language tutor Pingo AI (best hidden gem), kids learning game ABCmouse 2 (best for families), sleep alarm SleepisolBio (best for watches), note taker Goodnotes (best for large screens), audio app SoundCloud (best for cars), and meditation app Calm (best for XR headsets).\n    \n            \n            Luminar is the best multi-device app of the year.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhen it comes to games, the outright winner was Pokémon TCG Pocket, a digital take on the physical Pokémon card game that lets you collect cards on your Android device and battle with other players across the globe. It's going to have limited appeal outside Pokémon fans, but it's certainly well-designed.Google's other game picks are combat racer Disney Speedstorm (best multi-device game), streetball game Dunk City Dynasty (best multi-player), card game Candy Crush Solitaire (best pick up and play), puzzle adventure Chants of Sennaar (best indie), interactive detective story Disco Elysium (best story), open-world RPG Wuthering Waves (best ongoing), dark fishing adventure Dredge (best on Play Pass), and Norse mythology MMORPG Odin: Valhalla Rising (best for Google Play Games on PC).\n    \n            \n            Disney Speedstorm is the best multi-device game.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThere's a lot to choose from when it comes to ebooks and audiobooks, too, with 17 titles across fiction, non-fiction, and reads for younger people: from fantasy tale \"The Raven Scholar\" by Antonia Hodgson, to historical fiction title \"Herod the Great\" by Zora Neal Hurson. You can find the full list here.As for iOS, at the time I'm writing this article Apple has announced a shortlist for the 2025 App Store Awards, but we don't have the final winners yet.\n            ",

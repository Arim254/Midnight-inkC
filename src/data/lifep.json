That’s the case with so-called “biorhythms,” or periods of 23, 28, and 33 days that supposedly predict how mentally, physically, and actively on-point you’ll be on any given day. The concept of biorhythms is all over social media and has been for years, so you might think there's some legitimacy to it, but it's essentially hogwash. There are, however, other ways to track your “peaks” in productivity that are more scientifically sound.The difference between a biorhythm and circadian rhythmThe idea behind biorhythms is that over the course of month-long periods, your physical, emotional, and intellectual aptitudes fluctuate rhythmically, up and down, so you should be attuned to your personal schedule and act when each of them is at the top of one of its cycles. The first problem here is pretty obvious: Not only does this thinking dictate that you can or should be productive only once a month or so, but it gives you permission to coast when you perceive yourself to be on the low end of one of these so-called rhythms. If you're patiently waiting for a biorhythm to spike, your responsibilities and tasks can add up, which will leave you with a bunch of stuff to do—and much of it, left alone for so long, will likely have become urgent. Scientists have looked into this and deemed it balderdash, but the enduring belief in this phenomenon has led to some money grabs wherein influencers or other hucksters try to sell you products that can help you “hack” your own biorhythm to maximize your energy, productivity, and happiness. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nNow, you might have heard of circadian rhythms and assumed biorhythms are roughly the same thing. In fact, they're quite different. Per the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, circadian rhythms are the physical, mental, and behavioral changes that flow along a day-long cycle and they’re triggered by light and dark. There’s a whole science behind it (chronobiology), but what it amounts to is this: You get tired when it gets darker, your body sleeps at night, and you should be awake in daylight to get stuff done, ideally feeling alert. You can put a lot of energy into “hacking” your rhythm, but it’s all the obvious stuff: Sleep at night, don’t exert yourself or look at your phone before bed, go outside in the morning, stick to a schedule, etc.Biorhythms aren’t real, but circadian rhythms are. You’ll be more productive if you get consistent and good sleep. You don’t need to track peaks and valleys or subscribe to hokey apps to master this. Instead, focus on getting quality sleep and maximizing what you are doing during those precious daylight hours. If you're still looking for a structure to fill the void left by the false promise of biorhythms, let's get into the Yerkes-Dodson Law. The Yerkes-Dodson lawSome peaks and valleys are worth tapping into. The Yerkes-Dodson law models the relationship between stress levels and performance, showing how experiencing some stress and urgency can make you more productive. It’s been around since 1908, when psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson discovered it, and looks like a curve when it’s mapped out on a matrix, just like supposed “biorhythms” do. It looks like an upside-down U; on the left, you have your low-stress moments, on the right you have your high-stress moments, and in the middle, you have your peak, or the time when you’re just stressed enough to be productive but not totally overwhelmed. The Y-axis shows peak performance at the top and worst performance at the bottom, so you’ll notice that your poor performance times are aligned with having too little and too much stress.When you don’t have enough stress, you’ll be uninterested in your task. When you have too much, you’ll be too anxious to get it done well. The hypothesis Yerkes and Dodson came up with came around after studying the effects of electric shocks on mice’s ability to perform tasks. As stress increases, ability also increases—to an extent—because you have motivation.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo there is, in fact, a \"rhythm\" that counts for something, and that's the way your interest and stress fluctuate. You don't need to spend any money on an app or self-help book, but you should pay attention to how interested you are in a task at a given time—plus how motivated you feel in that moment. When no one is coming over to visit, for instance, you probably aren't as interested in cleaning your house as you would be if their arrival was in a day. You don't have stress or urgency. On the other hand, if they were arriving in 30 minutes and your place was a mess, you'd be so stressed you might not know where to start. The peak time to clean, then, might be the morning before they get there. You're interested and motivated, but not freaking out. Apply that same thinking to any task you need to accomplish. Pay close attention to how you feel in the lead-up to doing it so you can identify your own peak stress and peak productivity times. It helps to prioritize your to-dos and schedule your days and weeks thoroughly. Parkinson's Law goes hand in hand with Yerkes-Dodson, for instance. It says that the longer you give yourself to do something, the longer you'll naturally take to get it done, so you should give yourself less time overall. Having a smaller window in which to work on pressing tasks will up the urgency, aligning you more with the peak of Yerkes-Dodson. Pre-plan your weeks using prioritization techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix and task batching, thinking about when you'll have just the right amount of urgency to motivate you to do each task. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Maybe it's because I was an only child, but as useless as the animated paperclip (officially known as \"Clippit,\" by the way) was for advice, I did enjoy having a buddy on my desktop while I worked on essays. Now, Microsoft is bringing that same energy back, but for AI. And, finally, I think I understand the Clippy hate.Called Mico, the character is part of Copilot's fall release, which includes a dozen new updates. Some of these are what you'd expect by now: There's a new memory feature that ensures every new conversation doesn't start from scratch, and better integration with outside apps like Gmail or Google Calendar. But there's also a few more out-there ideas, like using Copilot Mode in Edge (which originally released in July) to pick up old browsing sessions right where you left off, even if you already closed all your tabs.By far, though, the most unexpected update is for Microsoft to lean back into its old animated mascot tendencies. Mico isn't the first AI companion, nor is it the most expressive. Grok will sell you on a whole anime girlfriend, if you're into that. But it does call back to a pedigree I once thought long buried (and now, I realize, maybe for good reason).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLike Clippy, and unlike Grok, Mico leans more towards the cute side of things, and is just a small, smiling, disembodied blob. It's entirely optional, but the idea is that it works with Copilot's voice input to make you feel like you're being listened to, changing color and reacting based on the tone of the conversation.If that all sounds a bit vague, it's because, well, Mico (and the rest of the Copilot fall release) is still rolling out. I don't have access to it yet, so the best I can do is check out this video shared by Microsoft.\nThe idea, though, is clearly to make AI seem friendlier. Microsoft announced Mico in a post titled \"Human-centered AI,\" and made a point out of debuting the character alongside a new \"real talk\" mode, which the company says \"challenges assumptions with care, adapts to your vibe, and helps conversations spark growth and connection.\"And I think that's where I finally start to raise my eyebrows a bit. On the plus side, in Microsoft's video, Mico doesn't appear to actually talk, so much as play simple animations. It's not going to build a parasocial relationship with you to the degree that Elon Musk's animated AI girlfriend, which comes with a romance bar to level up, does. On the other hand, though, it still feels like a way to lower my guard. Describing Mico to The Verge, corporate VP of product and growth at Microsoft AI Jacob Andreou said \"All the technology fades into the background, and you just start talking to this cute orb and build this connection with it.\"But what does it mean to be \"connected\" to a face that is inherently tied to a product?Essentially, with Mico, you're now looking at a big smiley face whenever you interact with Microsoft's AI, even as it continues to try to look at your screen, or redirect your web traffic, or bloat your computer with features that, according to testing done by TechRadar, can hurt performance. Maybe, actually, I should have my guard up when interacting with AI and not letting the technology fade out of my mind.For instance, Mico's release comes a week after Microsoft announced an initiative to \"Make every Windows 11 PC an AI PC.\" It's no wonder the company wants to give it a friendly face while it advertises features that take action for you based on simple voice commands. But am I comfortable with a future where I just tell my computer what I want, with little direct involvement, and expect the company that runs the cloud powering it to know what that means?To a degree, I can see the convenience in that. But it also leaves me at the whims of Microsoft, and it's hard not to see Mico's friendly smile as a way to spin that as a good thing, rather than as a loss in control. At least Clippy could look sarcastic.Maybe I'm overreacting, but in the same blog where Microsoft introduced Mico, it also debuted \"Copilot for health\" and \"Learn Live.\" In the former, the company actively encourages you to take your health questions to its AI, while the latter supposedly lets Copilot act as a \"voice-enabled Socratic tutor.\" Microsoft promises that Copilot for health, at least, pulls from credible sources like Harvard Health, but as AI continues to face security risks and accusations of model collapse, I remain skeptical about letting it aid in self-diagnosing or tutoring my kid.And perhaps that's on me. When I finally get Copilot's fall release, it could prove itself. But Mico is the exact type of mascot that's meant to dismantle skepticism while it's still healthy. It benefits Microsoft, but \"corporate-centered AI\" and \"human-centered AI\" aren't the same thing. At best, I think Mico will seem obnoxious, in the same way enforced positivity usually does. But at worst, it comes across as a first attempt to make your computer seem like a friend you make requests of, rather than a machine you own. While users fight for right-to-repair and warn about dropping tech literacy among people who spend all their time with computers, it's hard not to see the idea of Copilot as a friend rather than something a bit more sinister.The Clippy connections aren't just in my head, for what it's worth. Andreou also told The Verge that \"Clippy walked so that we [Mico] could run.\" But as we approach Halloween, I'd like to remind Microsoft that sometimes, dead is better.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Windows RE offers a series of functions to help you root out whatever is ailing your machine. Using it, you can choose to reset your computer, run an automated diagnosis and repair tool, adjust settings to see if any are causing the issue, uninstall previous updates that might be tripping up Windows, and restore to a previous back Windows backup, among other potentially helpful options. It's a necessary feature of the operating system, meant for times when a simple shut down and restart doesn't help your PC get back to normal operations. So it's not ideal when Windows ships with a bug that not only breaks part of the OS, but also breaks the part of the OS designed to help fix your PC.As spotted by Tom's Hardware, a bug in Windows 11's October update, KB5066835, hinders your ability to access Windows RE. The recovery environment can still load if you need it, but you'll find you won't be able to select any of the options it offers to try to fix your PC. That's because this bug breaks USB device functionality specifically in Windows RE. Simply stated, your mouse and keyboard will not work in Windows RE, preventing any navigation within the recovery environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is obviously bad news for anyone who wants to use Windows RE to fix a problem with their PC—including, ironically, this Windows RE-specific bug. But you might think that so long as your particular issue with Windows isn't prohibiting you from actually using your computer, you could live without Windows RE for the time being. As Tom's Hardware points out, however, it's not so simple: When your PC has trouble starting up, it will automatically boot into the recovery environment. That's normally a good thing, since you'll have the tools to help diagnose and solve the issue. However, when Windows takes you to a screen where you can't use your mouse and keyboard, or interact with any elements whatsoever, you're kind of stuck. Microsoft has issued a patchThe good news is a fix is officially here. Microsoft had called out the bug as a known issue in Windows 11, version 25H2, and said it was working on releasing a fix \"in the coming days.\" That fix came sooner than expected. The new KB5070773 update restores USB device functionality in Windows RE, so you should update as soon as possible. If you have normal access to Windows, all you need to do is head to Start > Settings > Windows Update, and install it when it appears.However, if your PC is stuck in Windows RE, it's a bit trickier to solve. As Tom's Hardware explains, Microsoft recommends users to use their touchscreens or PS/2 ports if available. If not, you may need to rely on a USB recovery drive to get your PC back up and running.  Windows is experiencing other issues, tooWindows is going through it this month. This same October update also broke localhost functionality, which impacted any apps that connect to services running locally on your PC. (Luckily, Microsoft did issue a fix for that bug.) Then, last week, the company also officially ended support for Windows 10, and though it still offers Extended Security Updates for any user that wants to enroll their PC in the program, it puts the security of roughly half a billion PC users into question.   This Windows RE bug is just one more critical issue PC users have to deal with. Hopefully, Microsoft's next Windows 11 build introduces only fixes, and no additional bugs.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

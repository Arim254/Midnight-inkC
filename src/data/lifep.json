Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.If you have a Premium Family plan through Spotify, there's good news: You can now set up managed accounts for your kids. Not only can you control what they listen to, their music choices won't reflect in or affect your listening history. Congratulations: You're getting your Wrapped back.    On Tuesday, Spotify announced it is rolling out managed accounts for Premium subscribers to seven new regions: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Premium Family subscribers in these countries can now create managed accounts for users younger than 13 that allow those users to listen on their own, in a controlled environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nManaged accounts are music-only, so younger listeners can't browse Spotify's other offerings, such as podcasts, or send or receive DMs. In addition, account managers can control a number of settings on these accounts, including whether the account can listen to explicit music, choose to block specific artists and songs, and decide to hide video—including short-form Canvas content.While Spotify has an existing service designed for children, Spotify Kids, it's much different, as it only contains music hand-picked for the service, and doesn't allow subscribers to control the account. Managed accounts allow subscribers to give a full Spotify experience to their kids, while having total control over what they can listen to. Personally, I think this is a fantastic feature. As someone who grew up in the early days of iTunes, I would have loved the ability to add whatever songs I wanted to my playlists—assuming my parents gave those songs the OK, of course. It's also great that kids can get recommendations for new music from Spotify. If they are obsessed with the latest trending song, perhaps Spotify can recommend similar tunes, both contemporary tracks as well as classics. It could be a great way to expand kids' music tastes.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify first tested managed accounts in 10 other countries: New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Columbia. It's now available as part of its Premium Family plan, which costs $19.99 per month.   How to create a managed accountIf you're using the Spotify mobile app, head to Settings and privacy > Account > Premium Family. If you're on your account page on Spotify's website, choose \"Manage members.\" Either way, under Plan members, choose to add members to your plan. Choose \"Add a listener aged under 13,\" then choose \"Add account.\"You'll then follow the on-screen steps to confirm you are the parent or guardian of the listener; set a PIN to control the experience; choose the name and birthdate of the listener; and choose your settings. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the weekend, multiple Reddit users complained that their Pixel 10 phones, which only just hit the market in August, were already facing severe slowdowns and frequent crashes while trying to load apps. Worse yet, the problem seemed to persist across all apps and models of the phone, leaving users with little they could actually do on their new devices. \"If an app does open and load it won't let me touch anything and it crashes,\" user cdriese said, with a number of others sharing a similar sentiment.The unfortunate news took me as a bit of a surprise, since I experienced no such issues while reviewing the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro at launch, both of which I quite liked. But the problem, it seems, only popped up recently. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMultiple users across Reddit pointed to October 10's Google Play Services update as the culprit here, with some saying that uninstalling the update fixed the problem for them. \"My running theory is that the October play services update is clashing with the September Android OS update in some way,\" said user PuzzleHeadedSquid, adding that they have had no crashes since uninstalling the Play Services update. Sure enough, when I loaded my phone with both the September Android OS update and the initial October play services updates installed, I also started to have issues.In a way, though, that's still a relief. Your new hardware isn't broken already—but uninstalling the new Play Services update introduces its own headaches. Luckily, as of this morning, there's another solution, and it's pretty simple.If you're experiencing crashing apps on your Pixel 10, here's what you can do.The official fixRandom Reddit users weren't the only folks experiencing this problem. Android Police founder Artem Russakovskii also called out the problem in an October 12 X post, saying his Pixel 10 Pro XL had been \"kneecapped\" by it.\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nLuckily, as a member of the press, he had a bit more resources at his disposal for fixing this bug than the average Redditor. Over the course of the weekend, Russakovskii quickly got in touch with his contacts at Google, who he says scrambled multiple teams to address the issue and has since issued a server-side fix.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTheoretically, that means a simple restart should bring your phone back to normal, although if the problem persists, you'll also want to make sure you're running the most recent Google Play services build (which you can check under Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details), then do another restart.It's a pretty quick turnaround on a fix, and doesn't require much on your part, but if you've temporarily shelved your Pixel, it's worth booting it back up again to see if you're still having issues.The unofficial fixThat said, it's possible Google's engineers still might have missed something. If you still find yourself having issues loading apps, you can use the community method of uninstalling the October Play Services update instead. This will log you out of your Google accounts, however, and won't include Google's official fix, so I'd only recommend it in an emergency.That said, if you're at the point of pulling your hair out, you can navigate to Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details and tap \"Remove updates\" to start the process. Just be sure to have your Google passwords (or passkeys!) memorized first.First, though, try hitting the \"Update\" button next to it instead, then restarting your phone. That's what I did, after initially running my testing without this morning's update, and my apps are now as snappy as ever.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Pop in, get the shot, then go about my day. That process has now gotten even easier: Last year, the FDA approved the first flu vaccine that you can administer yourself, or that parents can administer to their children, and it's now available for at-home ordering. I just placed my order. And best of all: It’s a nasal spray, so no needles.How can you get the at-home flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine, called FluMist, still needs to be prescribed by a medical provider. But since nearly everyone aged two through 49 is eligible, FluMist’s maker (AstraZeneca) has a telehealth website that bundles the provider's approval with an order to an online pharmacy. The process takes about five minutes on average, they say, and I found that to be accurate. I've already had my flu shot this year, but my kids haven't gotten it yet. (I also know my daughter strongly prefers the nasal to the injection when possible.) The website allowed me to add multiple people to the same order, so I filled out the questionnaire for each child, giving their names, ages, allergies, and so on. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe website then reached into some big data cloud out there and told me it already knew their insurance information (existentially frightening, yet convenient!) and presented me with my bill: an $8.99 fee, which included $2.50 for physician evaluation and $6.49 for shipping and processing. Insurance covers the cost of the vaccine itself. Who can use the at-home flu vaccine? The at-home vaccine is the same as regular FluMist, which is approved for ages two through 49. That means babies and older adults will still need to visit a provider for the regular, injectable flu vaccine. Children can get flu shots starting at the age of six months.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFluMist uses a live, weakened virus. It can't give you the actual flu, but it can cause some respiratory symptoms in people with weakened immune systems. So it's not recommended for people who are pregnant, have certain medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have close contact with an immunocompromised person. If that's you, talk to a provider about your best options. You may be advised to get the regular injectable type, which doesn't include any live virus. How do you give yourself the at-home flu vaccine? Mine hasn't arrived yet, but the instructions say that a package containing the vaccine will arrive at my door on the day I selected. It will be packed in an insulated container with cold packs, and should be put in the refrigerator upon arrival. There's also a tag I can scan to make sure the vaccine stayed at the proper temperature during the shipping process. Assuming that all goes well, you follow the instructions to spray the vaccine up your nose. (If you've gotten a FluMist at a pharmacy, it's the same idea.) Adults can administer it to themselves, and children will need an adult to do it for them. Instructions are, of course, provided. After you administer the vaccine, there is a prepaid envelope you can use to return the sprayers for disposal.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Researchers have demonstrated a new type of malware attack that can steal sensitive information from Android devices—including Google and Samsung phones—without the knowledge or action of the target user. The attack is called \"Pixnapping,\" an apparent portmanteau of \"pixel\" and \"snapping.\" When you download and open a piece of software containing the malware, the app scans your phone for specific apps it might want to spy on. It then accesses another app on your phone—say, Google Authenticator—but rather than open it, it pulls the information that would be displayed into the Android rendering pipeline. From there, the app scans the display information for individual pixels, targeting areas known to contain sensitive information. In the case of Google Authenticator, the focus is on the pixels known to contain the 2FA codes within the app. The malware then checks to see whether a pixel is blank, or contains some type of rendered content. It uses these findings to recover the original images, like a complete 2FA code, without ever actually having seen the original images in the first place. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis process can repeat for as long as it takes to scan the stolen pixels and pull the original information from them, all without you knowing it's happening. Researchers compare the process to taking screenshots of screen contents the malware should not have access to.How the malware worksThere are three reasons Pixnapping attacks are possible on Android, according to researchers. First, the OS allows apps to send another app's activity to the Android rendering pipeline, which allows the malicious app to invoke sensitive activities, like refreshing 2FA codes. Second, apps can run graphical operations on pixels displayed through another app's activity, which is how the malicious app can pull pixels from something like Google Authenticator. Third, apps can measure the pixel color-dependent side effects of those operations, which allows the malicious app to leak the pixel values.Researchers demonstrated these Pixnapping attacks on Google and Samsung phones, including the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Galaxy S25. These phones were running Android 13, 14, 15, and 16. Researchers say they aren't sure if other types of Android devices are affected by this attack, though the \"core mechanisms\" involved are usually present in all Android devices. Different Pixel devices had different rates of success in the 2FA hack (73%, 53%, 29%, and 53% for the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively), though researchers could not obtain 2FA codes on the Galaxy S25 within the 30 second timeline before the codes refreshed.  In addition to devices, researchers demonstrated Pixnapping attacks on sites and services like Gmail, Google Accounts, Signal, Google Authenticator, Venmo, and Google Maps. The implication is that this type of attack could steal many different types of information from your phone, including emails, encrypted messages, payment records, and location histories.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAccording to the findings, Google has tried to patch Pixnapping, but researchers were able to workaround this patch in demonstrated attacks. The vulnerability is currently tracked as CVE-2025-48561. Google is working on a new patch for the December Android security builtin. How to protect yourself from PixnappingThe good news, at this time anyway, is that researchers are not aware of Pixnapping attacks happening in the wild. However, that doesn't mean they won't happen, especially now that the attack has been disclosed. The first thing to do to protect yourself is to make sure you're running the latest security patches on your Android device. While Google is still working on a subsequent Pixnapping patch, there is a patch in existence. Make sure you install it on your phone by heading to System > Software updates.Next, be cautious with the apps you download on your device. Always try to download apps from trusted and verified marketplaces, as it's much more difficult for bad actors to hide malware on apps distributed through these stores. Even when you download apps on something like the Google Play Store, investigate the app thoroughly: Ensure it's really the app you think it is, and it's coming from the developer that makes it. If you sideload apps, be careful with what you download, and only install apps from developers you trust.   \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's the end of an era: TiVo no longer manufactures or sells the DVRs that made the company a household name. If you still have one, the company will continue to support it, but don't go looking for one: TiVo as we know it is effectively over.TiVo didn't make a big deal about this discontinuation, however. As it happens, Luke Bouma of Cord Cutter News was the first to spot the development. Earlier this month, Bouma reported that TiVo Corporation had silently ended its DVR line, removing all references to the devices on its website. Following Bouma's reporting, TiVo's parent company, Xperi, confirmed the news.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn a statement to PCMag, an Xperi spokesperson said: \"I can confirmed that as of [Oct.] 1, 2025, TiVo stopped selling physical DVR products, including hardware and accessories, both online and through agents...TiVo no longer manufacturers hardware, and our remaining inventory is now depleted, though we will continue to offer support for the products going forward.\" TiVo isn't gone entirely. The brand now develops both TiVo OS, a smart TV operating system similar to Roku OS or Fire OS, as well as DTS AutoStage Video Service, an entertainment service developed for cars. But it is no longer a DVR manufacturer or seller, which might shock a time traveler from the early 2000s.The TiVo effectTech comes and goes, but if you weren't watching TV in the late '90s and early 2000s, you might not know how monumental TiVo really was. The company launched its first DVRs in 1999 and introduced the market to features like one-touch simple recording, a hard drive to save multiple recordings at once, and, perhaps most notably, the ability to \"pause\" live TV and fast forward through commercials. The DVR offered viewers so much more than a simple VCR could, which only allowed for linear recording to single cassettes. TiVo could record live video from any input, including analog, cable, or satellite, which offered users flexibility in the content they recorded.Before TiVo, if you missed the start of a show, you simply had to deal with it and try to jump in as best as you could—assuming you didn't set a VCR to record it, of course. If you had a TiVo, however, you could simply rewind to the start of the program, and, when you reached a commercial break, skip ahead back to the show—until you caught up with the live broadcast. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTiVo disrupted the way consumers watched TV, and we're likely seeing the ramifications of that today. The market adapted, and cable companies started offering their own DVRs with cloud-based recording as opposed to hard drive recording. Streaming services built on that momentum: Viewers were already getting used to watching shows whenever it suited them, so why not get ahead of the game, and offer all shows on-demand at any time? There's no need to choose which programs to record: Everything is available at any time. Like other early technology pioneers that fell behind with time, TiVo struggled through the streaming age it arguably helped create. The company hasn't released a DVR since 2019, when it launched the TiVo Edge. That DVR had support for modern features, like 4K Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos sound, and access to major streaming apps, in addition to recording live TV. It then tried to break into the streaming device market with the TiVo Stream 4K, but the competition was too fierce to make an impact. In a twist of irony, as TiVo discontinues its DVRs, streaming services are turning to ad-supported plans with increasing frequency. TiVo changed the game by letting us skip ads, and streaming originally omitted the ads entirely. But more and more customers are comfortable paying less to deal with commercials. We've come full circle in a way. TiVo's time might be at an end, but its impact lives on. What Skype did for video calls, TiVo did for TV. I'll be thinking about that the next time I boot up something to watch on Netflix or Hulu.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Other times, the company simply drops the news on a random Wednesday morning. This Wednesday morning is one such example: Following a preview on social media, Apple has announced the M5 chip, as well as three products that will kick off this new era of Apple silicon: the M5 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pros, and Vision Pro.    The M5 chip The big news that unifies all updated Apple products today is the M5 chip. As the name might imply, this is the company's fifth generation of Apple silicon, its custom system on a chip (SoC). \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple is selling M5 as a chip optimized for AI. The company says the new 16-core Neural Engine delivers both performance and efficiency boosts for AI processes. That means Apple Intelligence features should be faster and more accurate, though I'm not sure that's enough to get me to use it. In addition, the chip's 10-core GPU has a dedicated \"Neural Accelerator\" in each core, which offers over four times peak GPU compute over the M4 chip, and six times the compute of M1. Apple specifically touts the improvements for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, which can now take advantage of \"accelerated processing\" for AI tasks, like running diffusion models and large language models. In other graphics gains, M5's GPU and enhanced shader cores can be up to 30% faster than M4 and up to 2.5 times faster than M1. It comes with Apple's third-gen ray-tracing engine, which offers a boost for any process that uses ray tracing to calculate lighting effects. Those improved graphics means the new Apple Vision Pro can render 10% more pixels as well as handle refresh rates up to 120Hz. M5's unified memory now has a bandwidth of 153GB/s, a nearly 30% jump over M4 and over 2x boost over M1, according to Apple. All devices running M5 can access the entire memory pool at once, which Apple says makes it possible to run larger AI models entirely on-device. That's great news for privacy for anyone using AI on these MacBooks, iPads, or Vision Pro. Users can configure M5 to come with up to 32GB of RAM.MacBook Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nApple did something interesting with its M5 kickoff for the Mac: It started only with the 14-inch MacBook Pro. If you want a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M5, you'll need to wait. This new 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with all the new performance gains that Apple advertises for the M5 chip, with some unique benefits as well. Apple says this machine has up to 24 hours of battery life, which, if true, would be huge: You could work two full 12-hour days before needing to find a charger for your MacBook. M5 also brings upgrades to the SSD in this MacBook Pro, which Apple says will help in professional workflows like importing RAW images to exporting huge video files.  Other than that, this is the same 14-inch MacBook Pro that you otherwise know by now. You get the Liquid Retina XDR display with a 12MP Center Stage camera, HDMI port, SD card slot, and three USB-C ports, in either silver or black. It even starts at the same $1,599 price as the M4 MacBook Pro, for the model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \niPad Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nLike the new MacBook Pro, the iPad Pro looks unchanged, save for the new M5 and its performance gains. But there's a little more under the hood here than just the new chip. Apple says the cellular iPad Pro models get the company's C1X modem, which can offer up to 50% faster cellular data performance. If you opt for the cellular iPads, that's good news, though I always opt for the wifi-only model, and use my iPhone as a hotspot. To each their own. In addition to the C1X, these new iPads also get the N1 chip, which supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Apple says N1 supports better performance on 5GHz networks, and boosts performance of features including AirDrop and Personal Hotspot. Apple says the 256GB and 512GB iPad Pros here start with 12GB of RAM. That's 4GB more than the M4 iPad Pros, which started at 8GB each. You'll also notice faster charging speeds on these new iPads: Apple says with the right adapter, such as the company's new dynamic power adapter, you can reach 50% battery in about 30 minutes. These iPads also now support external displays running at up to 120Hz.Vision Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nThe M5 chip is even coming to a refreshed Vision Pro. Apple's mixed-reality headset might not be the success story the company wanted, but it hasn't abandoned the device, either. To the contrary, this Vision Pro has a few upgrades here in addition to M5's performance, efficiency, and AI gains.As mentioned above, the new Vision Pro can now render 10% more pixels across its micro-OLED displays than the previous generation can. It can also boost the refresh rate to 120Hz when needed, which should help sell the virtual reality illusion, including when working with virtual displays.  But it's not just about the technology, here. Apple has upgraded the Vision Pro's headband—specifically, the Dual Knit Band. Apple says this band should be more comfortable, with \"3D-knitted\" upper and lower straps. The lower strap in particular provides a counterweight, which should help take some of the pressure off the user when wearing it. Unfortunately, this strap is a separate $99 purchase. Like the current Vision Pro, this model starts at $3,499 for 256GB of internal storage.All of these devices are available for pre-order starting today, and will be available in stores on Oct. 22.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

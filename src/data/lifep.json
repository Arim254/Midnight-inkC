It's not your internet connection, and it isn't your OpenAI account: ChatGPT is down. According to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, users started reporting issues with ChatGPT at 11:56 a.m. ET. Those reports ballooned by 12:11 p.m., as the total number of incidents as of this article currently sits above 7,000. If you're an avid ChatGPT user, you might have also had issues with the bot yesterday: Downdetector shows over 25,000 reports of down time starting at 2:56 p.m. Tuesday and resolving around 4:11 p.m. the same day. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with all outages, OpenAI will likely figure out a patch for the issue soon enough. But these outages are becoming more common. There was the Verizon outage, of course, but other services like TikTok have also experienced intermittent periods of downtime. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you don't use a password manager (which you absolutely should), AutoFill via Apple Wallet saves you the trouble of having to manually enter your credit card information every time you want to make a purchase on your phone. Even if you have a password manager, though, not all plans allow payment card storage and autofilling, and the feature can be clunky on those that do. As 9to5Mac points out, AutoFill for credit cards was already available in Safari and is now supported systemwide, managed through Apple Wallet. How to set up and use AutoFill in Apple WalletFirst, you'll need to add your payment cards to Apple Wallet's autofill list (which is separate from your general wallet). Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner and select AutoFill. Tap Add Card to input card details manually or use the camera scan feature. The security code is optional, meaning you can add and store it in Apple Wallet AutoFill or enter it for each transaction. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo autofill saved credit cards, simply tap any form field to bring up the Paste/AutoFill option. Select AutoFill > Credit Card, authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, and tap the card you want to enter. You'll have to repeat the process for each field, as Apple Wallet won't autofill the whole form at once. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies.

But what if you actually used the right ctrl key? Or what if you prefer Claude or ChatGPT to Copilot? Whatever your reason for not loving the Copilot key, don't worry—you can change it. Here's how to do so in the Windows settings or, if necessary, using Microsoft Powertoys.How to change the Copilot key in settingsOpen the Settings application and head to the Personalization section. You should find a Customize Copilot key option here, assuming you're using a recent-ish version of Windows 11. Click the drop-down menu and you'll have three options: Copilot, Search, and Custom. You can change the button to Search if you'd rather use the key to bring up the Windows search tool instead of Copilot.Alternatively, you can use the Custom option to launch any application on your computer instead of Copilot. This could be a useful way to open the Claude or ChatGPT desktop apps instead of Copilot. Or, if you're not a big AI fan, you could just have it open your browser.\nThis is a limited number of options, granted, but it's easy and doesn't require any sort of tools. It's your simplest option.How to change the Copilot key using Microsoft PowertoysYou may have noticed that the options in Settings don't let you remap the Copilot key to the ctrl key, or any other key—all you can do is launch an application. For that, you're going to need to install Powertoys, the secret Microsoft app that improves Windows.After installing, go to the Keyboard Manager section. The simplest thing to do, which may or may not work on your computer, is to click Remap keys. You should be able to press your Copilot key to remap it (it will show up as F23, which we'll get to). Now you can choose what you want the key to serve as. This could be ctrl, if you like, or it could be any other key. Click OK, and you should be done.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThere's a chance this won't work for you. Why? Because the Copilot key works a little differently depending on what kind of laptop you have. Buckle up: This gets complicated in a very Microsoft-y way.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn many computers, the Copilot key functions as an F23 key. This is a workaround, of sorts, allowing Microsoft to add a key without changing the operating system very much. Most modern keyboards only have one row of function keys—around 12 in total. Keyboards in the 80's and 90's sometimes had two rows of keys—around 24 in total. Windows, to this day, still supports all 24 keys, even though basically no one has that many function keys. Microsoft took advantage of this—on many laptops the Copilot key functions as an F23 key.But this is Windows, so of course it's more complicated than that. On some laptops, pressing the Copilot key triggers a keyboard shortcut: Windows-Shift-F23. This means you can't use the Remap keys function in Powertoys to remap the Copilot key, because the Copilot key already triggers a keyboard shortcut.What you can do is use the Remap a shortcut option. Use this, then press the Copilot key as your selection. You should see the keyboard shortcut Windows-Shift-F23 show up. Now choose what you want to remap your Copilot key to.This works, with a caveat: You really can't use it to bring back your ctrl key, as users have noted on Github. The issue is that you can't remap a keyboard shortcut to a modifier key, just to a single keypress. It's not clear what could fix this, and I suspect users of such laptops are just stuck. Which is all to say that you might not be able to get your control key back, but least you can remap the key to do something else.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Back in ancient times, I had to google the lyrics to the songs I was listening to—which was fine if I was near a computer, but impossible when I was on the go with my iPod. This is probably why there are so many songs I think I know the words to, only to discover, once I read the actual lyrics, that I am sorely mistaken. Built-in lyrics are thus a feature that is equal parts useful and humbling. As it happens, Spotify's existing lyrics features are getting some upgrades to kick off February. The company announced three key updates on Wednesday—two that impact free users, and one exclusive to Premium subscribers. Spotify might not offer Apple Music's dynamic lyrics, but these updates should still be welcomed by anyone who likes reading along to their music. Spotify now supports offline lyricsThe biggest announcement of the day—in my opinion, anyway—is offline support for lyrics. This is always something that frustrates me whenever I'm using my phone without cellular service. Say I download some albums to listen to on a flight: When I try to listen to them in airplane mode, lyrics are unavailable. Being able to download the lyrics when you grab a song or album is a small but actually meaningful upgrade.\nUnfortunately, offline lyrics are not available free of charge: At this time, the feature is only available to Premium subscribers, which makes sense, given that free users can't download music for offline listening anyway—only podcasts.Lyrics are moving to a new location in the Spotify appTraditionally, lyrics have appeared at the bottom of the player window in the Spotify app. To view them, you need to scroll down, then tap on the lyrics window to fully expand it. It seems Spotify wasn't content with this UI. The company says that in its testing, it finds that placing the lyrics directly below the album art, rather than below the player, makes them easier to interact with. And so that's where the lyrics are moving. The company calls these \"lyrics previews,\" as you see just a snippet of the lyrics at one time. This change is rolling out to both free and Premium users on iOS and Android. If you'd rather not see the lyrics at all, you can tap the three-dot menu and choose \"Lyrics Off.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify is adamant that this new placement won't change lyric sharing. You'll still be able to send specific lyrics to friends and social media platforms. You'll just need to do so from the new lyrics window. Spotify now support lyrics translations worldwideSpotify's lyrics translation feature makes it easy to figure out what artists are singing about when you don't speak their particular language. When you listen to a song that doesn't match your device's system language, you'll find a translate button in the lyrics window. Tap that, and Spotify will include translations beneath each line of the song, so you can follow along. According to Spotify, this feature was available in more than 25 markets as of the end of last year, but now, the company is rolling out the feature worldwide. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?There's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products, but, anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking. Perhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\nFirefox's AI features are easy to opt out ofOn Monday, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which drops Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in the between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any. \nWhat AI features Firefox offersFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.Alt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.AI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.Link previews: Shows key points before opening a link. AI chatbot in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.If you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle. Once activated, not only will these features not appear, but Firefox will block any pop-ups or alerts pushing you to try existing or future AI features. Any Firefox users who aren't keen on AI features will want to check out this new controls menu starting Feb. 24—though there are certainly more egregious AI features out there. Translations can be convenient, as can link previews. But I know I'd never want a chatbot in the sidebar of my browser. If I used Firefox as my main browser, I would definitely disable at least that feature, if not all of them. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Right now, it's far more common to send these pictures and clips to friends and family through private chat groups—but what you might not have realized is that they get pretty heavily compressed along the way.There are many reasons for this: It means the files get sent faster, for example, and that the companies behind these messenger apps don't have to spend quite so much on cloud storage (imagine millions of images being sent by millions of users, all the time). However, the recipients of these photos and videos are missing out, and getting copies that are of a much lower quality.A lot of the time, you can't really tell the difference on a small phone screen, which is why apps can get away with it. But if you're looking at something on a computer screen or trying to print something out to get a permanent physical copy, the compression quickly becomes apparent. It's something most messenger apps do—but there is a workaround if you want your photos and videos shared at full resolution.\nHow much do messenger apps compress your files?\n    \n            \n            Look out for the HD button when sharing on Instagram.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nMessenger apps are rather coy when it comes to revealing just how much compression they apply: Search the web and you'll hit Reddit threads and support forums rather than actual official documents. Apple admits iMessage applies compression \"when necessary\", and Google acknowledges files \"may have a lower resolution\" when sent through Google Chat, but it's all rather vague.To try and get a bit more clarity, I ran a quick test myself, with a 12MP, 4,000 x 3,000 pixel, 3.4MB image taken on a Pixel. Bearing in mind that compression levels will vary depending on what you're sending, and this was just a test with a single image, here's how the file was changed after it got sent through various DMs:Facebook Messenger: 2,048 x 1,536 pixels, 392KBGoogle Chat: 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, 324KBGoogle Messenger: 4,000 x 3,000 pixels, 3.4MB.iMessage: 4,000 x 3,000 pixels, 3.2MBInstagram: 1,000 x 750 pixels, 138KBWhatsApp: 2,000 x 1,500 pixels, 390KBYou can see there's a lot of compression going on here, but Google Messages and iMessage are the clear winners when it comes to retaining original quality (at least with images)—a good advert for both Apple's proprietary messaging system and for RCS.It's also worth delving into the settings for each app. In Instagram, for example, there's a HD button next to the photo and video picker: When I selected this, Instagram shrank my original photo down to 2,000 x 1,500 pixels, with a file size of 421KB.In its help section, Instagram says it automatically adjusts image compression based on current network conditions, which is something else to think about—you might want to do all your photo and video sharing over wifi (which is what I did here).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to send files in their original quality through messenger apps\n    \n            \n            It only takes a couple of taps to get iCloud links in Apple Photos.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can make sure your photos and videos get to your friends and family in their glorious, original quality, but you lose a bit of convenience along the way. Essentially, you need to pick a cloud storage service where your images and videos will be stored in full resolution, and then share links to these files—rather than sharing the files themselves.It's not quite the same immediate experience if you're sending around baby pictures or party pictures: Your recipients will just see a rather dull-looking link instead of thumbnails right inside their apps (though in some cases, there might be a small preview attached). If quality is what matters most to you, this is the way to go when it comes to sharing photos and videos.You're free to use your cloud storage provider of choice, but if there is one made by the same company behind your favorite messaging app, it makes sense to combine them together. In Google Photos on Android, for example, you can tap on a photo to view it, then choose Share and Share again to find the Create link feature: You can then share this link with any contact in any app.For Apple Photos on the iPhone, you can get a link to a photo once you've opened it up by tapping the share button (lower left), then Copy iCloud Link. Again, you can paste this anywhere you like, and it's not much more difficult to share entire folders of pictures rather than individual images.There is an extra advantage to sharing photos and videos this way, in that you can revoke sharing permissions any time you like: New people can be added and other people can be removed from albums showing your toddler growing up for example. It's not as fast and easy as direct file sharing, but you do get a bit more control (and higher resolutions).\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

It has a longer battery life and tiny tweaks that make a big difference, like a brighter screen, greater durability, and new software features. Right now, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm) is down 25% to $299 (originally $399), marking its lowest price ever on Amazon. \nIn PCMag's real-world testing, the watch delivered nearly two days of battery life and features a brighter screen with 2,000 nits of peak brightness. It’s also more rugged than its predecessor, with a harder, scratch-proof screen, a waterproof build (paired with a water temperature sensor and depth gauge up to 6 meters), and a dust-proof IP6X rating. It features Apple’s newest and smartest software, watchOS 26, which includes features such as Sleep Score metrics and enhanced safety alerts like life-saving hypertension notifications.Unlike the Apple Watch SE 3, for just $50 more at the current discount, the Series 11 has a thinner design with a larger display, and sensors that detect blood oxygen levels and ECGs, as well as other heart health and temperature sensors. The 11 also packs in an altimeter, gyroscope, compass, and ambient light sensor. Users can dive into their workout data via the iOS Fitness app, while the iOS Health app houses biometrics and ECG results. This model includes GPS, enabling real-time tracking of distance and pace during outdoor workouts.

Here are my tips on which products are likely to be a great buy, and which ones your better off waiting to pick up during a future sale.When is Presidents Day 2026?Presidents Day is a federal holiday that originally started to honor George Washington's birthday, but eventually evolved to recognize all U.S. presidents. Presidents Day falls on the third Monday of February each year, which means this year, it will take place on Feb. 16, 2026. Presidents Day sales, then, are usually concentrated on the weekend before the holiday, which means that this year, you're likely to see the biggest discounts from Feb. 13–16—and I wouldn't be surprised if some retailers start their sales even earlier.Presidents Day sales generally bring big discounts to items like home furnishings and mattresses, as well as major appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, and you can expect the same this year. As we're getting close to the end of winter, you'll likely also see price drops on winter gear like snow blowers, space heathers, and power generators, plus cold weather clothing like coats, as retailers try to sell down their inventory and make room for next season's items. You'll likely see some tech deals as well, as older model TVs and laptops will see price cuts to make room for newer models (some of which likely debuted at January's CES show). If you're planning to shop in one of these categories, start paying attention to prices now, so you'll be able to spot good discounts come the holiday weekend.What items aren't worth buying during Presidents Day sales?Seasons come and go, and even as retailers push their winter inventory out, they will try to sell you their spring products. You should hold off on picking these items up for now, as you'll likely be paying a premium price—even items that are \"marked down\" are likely to see bigger price cuts later, if you can wait.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWho will be holding Presidents Day sales?All major retailers will be having a Presidents Day sale, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others. The sales will generally be available both online and in-person (except at Amazon, of course).Should you wait for Amazon's Big Spring Sale? Presidents Day is a time-honored tradition, but in recent years, the biggest sale of the early part of the year has been Amazon's Big Spring Sale (with other retailers planning their own sales events around the same time). While we don't know the exact dates, its likely this year's will take place around the same time as last year—in mid- to late March. Is it worth waiting to shop until then? It depends on what you want to buy.The online retailer debuted the Big Spring Sale in 2024 with many sales on many different categories, but especially on tech, so if you're eyeing a specific tech product but haven't found a great deal yet, it's worth waiting to see if it is discounted in a month or so. However, if you're shopping for winter gear, mattresses, furniture, or large appliances, you'll likely see better discounts during Presidents Day sales.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

According to Google, feedback on the feature suggested it \"didn't provide helpful next steps\"—so while it alerted users when their data was out in the wild, it wasn't clear what to do about it. Now, Google is shifting its focus from the dark web monitoring tool to features like its online Security Check-Up and passkey protection. In other words, instead of flagging when your account credentials appear in a data breach, Google wants to make sure that your accounts stay safe even if a breach has occurred.There are reasons why you should be keeping an eye on dark web chatter, however—and there are tools to take over the monitoring job now Google has backed out.What is the dark web—and why do I need to monitor it?\n    \n            \n            Keeper provides a free dark web scan.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEssentially, the dark web is made up of online spaces that you can't get to just by pointing your browser at a web address. You need specialist software and a little bit of technical know-how to find your way into the dark web and to navigate around it. It's largely hidden from the world at large via encryption and rerouting. Why all the secrecy? The dark web is used to evade both law enforcement and ruling powers, so it's the perfect place to carry out somewhat illicit activities as well as get around the machinations of oppressive surveillance states. It's a place where hackers and whistleblowers alike can gather.\nSpeaking of hackers, dumps of information from data breaches will often find their way on to the dark web, to be traded or given away for free. Whether it's your email address, phone number, social security number, or passwords, if this data has been exposed by a hack, you're much more likely to find it on the dark web than on Reddit.Dark web monitoring tools, like the one Google just shut down, are intended to give you a heads up if your details have appeared in a data dump. You can then do something about it, whether it's getting in touch with your bank to check for any signs of identity theft, or changing the password for your email service.Having a dedicated tool for the task saves you from having to trawl the dark web yourself—which isn't particularly easy or pleasant—and while Google might be closing down its monitoring service, you've got several alternatives you can turn to instead.The best dark web monitoring tools you can try\n    \n            \n            Proton's dark web scanner is part of the Proton Unlimited subscription.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nProton is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and the privacy-focused company also has a Dark Web Monitoring tool of its own. You do need a paid plan to access it though, from $12.99 a month or $119.88 a year, which includes multiple perks across all Proton's products. You can find it from the Security and privacy side panel in the Proton Mail app.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nProton uses a variety of intelligence datasets in its dark web sweep, and looks out for details including email addresses, usernames, dates of birth, physical addresses, and government IDs. The leaks will be categorized in terms of how urgently action needs to be taken, and Proton doesn't give your data to third parties.Trend Micro has a Data Leak Checker that covers the dark web, which you can use without paying anything or even signing up for an account—though you can only check for mentions of your email address or phone number in leaks. For more comprehensive scans and alerts, you can sign up for a premium account, from $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year—and there's lots more included besides dark web monitoring.Keeper Security takes the same approach with BreachWatch: You can run a quick scan for breaches including your email address without paying or signing up, but if you want anything more advanced (including proactive notifications) then you need to sign up for $24.99 a year. The feature can be added to any of Keeper's other paid-for plans too.If you currently pay for a security product, such as a password manager or a VPN, you may well find that dark web monitoring is included—so check through your existing subscriptions. For example, the Surfshark Alert dark web monitoring tool comes as part of the Surfshark One VPN bundle, with pricing from $17.95 a month or $40.68 a year.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This so-called \"ghost student\" scam capitalizes on limited verification for online class sign-ups and the federal aid application process to steal millions in funds while assigning the debt to unsuspecting targets. I personally have been a victim of this scam, which I discovered only after an outstanding student loan debt landed on my credit report in 2024. Here's how the scheme works. 'Ghost student' scam relies on stolen identitiesTo run this scam, fraudsters use stolen or fake identities to enroll \"ghost students\" in online classes while also applying for federal student aid, including Pell grants and loans. Of course, they never actually attend those classes, instead disappearing with the money and placing the resulting financial burden on the individuals and schools they've conned. \nIn my case, scammers had used just enough accurate personal information to \"enroll\" at a community college in southern California and take out a Pell grant in my name. However, because the enrollment was fraudulent, the grant was considered overpaid and sent to collections via the U.S. Department of Education—which is how it landed on my credit record. According to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Inspector General (OIG), this type of fraud blew up with the shift to online and remote learning, particularly at community colleges that offer open enrollment (and generally engage in limited verification of applicant information). Increasingly, AI tools also likely help scammers to expand their reach with enrollment and loan applications and get past identity verification checks. The scheme has affected schools across the country. In California alone, nearly a third of all applicants to community colleges in 2024 were identified as fake. A handful of individuals have been sent to prison after stealing millions in \"ghost student\" financial aid, but the OIG still has 200 investigations open. For individuals targeted by the ghost student scam, the consequences are essentially the fallout of identity theft, such as debt falsely assigned to you that negatively affects your credit or the inability to get legitimate student loans (or any other type of credit) when you actually need them. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt also forces you into a long and arduous process of disputing the fraud: I spent several months going back and forth between the Department of Education, the community college, the credit bureaus, and an attorney to track down the fraudulent applications, file identity theft reports, provide extensive documentation proving that I wasn't responsible for the debt, and get the information removed from my record. How to protect your identity from student loan fraudUnfortunately, the ghost student scam circumvents a standard anti-fraud safeguard because most federal student aid doesn't require a credit check. (My credit record had been frozen for years, and still was at the time that this fraud took place.) While you should absolutely freeze your credit and thaw it temporarily only when needed, this step may not prevent bad actors from using your information to apply for grants and loans. Because this scam is a form of identity theft, you should take every precaution to safeguard your personal information. Given the ubiquity of data breaches and hacks, you can assume a lot of it is already out in the open, but that doesn't mean you can't lock accounts down and practice good digital hygiene. Credit fraud alerts and a regular review of your credit reports will help you catch any suspicious activity quickly. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For the second time in two years, the streaming service is raising prices, this time across all of its plans, including the entry-level Fan Tier. This comes shortly after the company discontinued its free, ad-supported tier on Dec. 31.The new tiers and their pricing will be as follows:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Fan Tier will go up from $7.99/month to $9.99/month. This tier offers basic access to the full Crunchyroll library, and the ability to download shows to a single device for offline viewing.The Mega Fan tier will go up from $11.99/month to $13.99/month. At this tier, you can stream on up to four devices at once, download content in HD for offline viewing, and get access to the Crunchyroll Game Vault.The Ultimate Fan Tier will go up from $15.99/month to $17.99/month. This tier adds access to Crunchyroll Manga, streaming on up to six devices at once, and a swag bag after you've been subscribed to this plan for a year. The new pricing will kick in on your first billing date after March 4. If you're not already subscribed, however, there's still a little bit of time to sign up and get the (slightly) lower price for your first month. While existing users can't lock in the lower price, Crunchyroll is offering a limited-time upgrade to an annual plan for the Fan Tier for $66.99/year, which comes out to $5.58/month. If you're confident you're still going to be subject to your anime addiction a year from now, this is going to be your best way to save money in the long run.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Limit Precise Location is a new setting that prevents some Apple devices from broadcasting specific locations to cell carriers.Precise location sharing is useful, even essential, in some cases, such as when you're navigating with your maps app. But you may not want to constantly be sending your exact address to your phone provider, where it could be used for malicious purposes. If you enable Limit Precise Location, your iOS device will share your general area instead.  Precise location sharing comes with privacy risksAs TechCrunch points out, precise location sharing introduces a whole host of privacy and security risks. Cell carriers have been targeted by hackers, compromising sensitive customer data. Surveillance vendors and law enforcement agencies may also use location information broadcast via cellular networks for the purposes of real-time and ongoing tracking. \nUsers already have the option to disable precise location sharing at the app level on both iOS and Android for apps that don't need GPS coordinates to function—which is most of them. This allows you to prevent companies from receiving (and selling) your exact location data when a general location is sufficient. Limit Precise Location won't change these app-specific settings. For now, the feature is available only on select Apple models—the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular—running iOS 26.3 with a limited number of global carriers: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nU.S.: Boost MobileUK: EE, BTGermany: TelekomThailand: AIS, TrueApple says that even with this setting enabled, emergency responders will still be able to pinpoint exact location during an emergency call.

The news was first highlighted by AppleInsider and involves warnings that look suspiciously like official Apple messaging. While AppleInsider's report doesn't link to any specific user complaints of this happening, it does include example screenshots, and reports matching AppleInsider's description have popped up on both Reddit and Apple's official support forums over the last 30 days.The scam might come over either email or text, and usually warns the recipient about a potentially fraudulent purchase made using their Apple Pay at a physical Apple Store, while offering a phone number or email to contact to address the issue. According to AppleInsider, it might also include a case ID, timestamp, or other technical details in order to appear more legitimate. One user on Reddit, for instance, considered that the scam might be a legitimate text from Apple because it included the official sounding phrase \"If this was you, no action is needed.\"However, inconsistencies remain, such as the scam often referring to Apple Accounts as Apple IDs, a now outdated term. Additionally, while emails might use official looking letterhead that makes them appear to come straight from Apple, mistakes could remain. For instance, an email could open with \"Hello {Name}\" instead of being addressed to the recipient's actual name. It could come from a bogus address, but even appearing to come from a legitimate source like \"[email protected]\" isn't a strong indicator that it's real, as it's possible for scammers to spoof email addresses. Overall, the idea seems to be to speed the recipient into action with an urgent tone, while using Apple's logo and a professional writing style to mask any clues as to who is really sending these notices.\nHow to tell if that Apple Pay text or email is actually a scam If you are receiving any texts or emails about your Apple Pay activity at all, chances are they probably aren't real—Apple doesn't reach out to its users in this way. Rather than sending texts or emails, communication instead comes directly from the Wallet app. Additionally, Apple Pay serves as a medium for payment rather than as a credit or debit account in and of itself. As such, if any fraudulent transactions are detected, notices would come from your bank or credit card provider rather than Apple itself.Still, it is worth keeping an eye out for any red flags as well. Look for small typos or unusual domain names, which can help give a fake message away, even if a lack of these isn't an indicator that a message is legitimate. Also, rather than calling any provided phone numbers, consider searching for them online to see whether they've been reported as being tied to a scam operation. At any rate, do not respond to these notices, and don't provide any information (such as passwords, which Apple will never ask for) to them if you've already reached out by accident. There are better ways to verify your Apple Pay activity.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat to do if you think you're being scammedIf you think a message you've received is illegitimate, the best thing you can do is ignore it and verify it independently. Instead of responding to the suspicious text or email directly, or calling any provided phone numbers, double check any claims made in the statement through official Apple channels. You can see your recent Apple Pay purchases in the Wallet app by tapping on one of your registered cards, and opening the Settings app and navigating to Media & Purchases > View Account > Purchase History will show you any recent App Store purchases. If you don't see a transaction mentioned in one of these notices in your official payment history, chance are it never happened.If you're still in doubt you have options. Rather than reaching out to an email or phone number linked in a potential scam notice, start fresh with a new message straight to Apple's official support. You can find the proper contact details, including an official Apple phone number for your region, on Apple's website. The company will be able to determine whether it's seen any suspicious activity tied to your account.Finally, once you're certain a message is part of a scam, you can forward it (or simply report it, if forwarding isn't possible) to Apple to help the company shut it down. The specific email address you'll want to use will differ based on the type of message, and you can find all your options on Apple's support website, under \"How to report suspicious emails, messages, and calls.\" Once you've sent the message to the correct channels, delete it from your inbox to keep yourself from accidentally clicking any compromised links. As added security, also consider changing your Apple Account password, or using a password manager.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Shortly thereafter, it kicked off an early access program allowing interested users to try it out free of charge. Unfortunately, that honeymoon period has come to an end: Alexa+ has now officially launched, and now you'll need to pay to access its most useful features.While certain features will still be free to use, the majority of the Alexa+ experience is now locked behind a paywall. True, you might already pay for that paywall—but if you don't, it's going to cost you quite a bit to keep the features you've been test driving for months. (Of course, the standard Alexa assistant still exists if you don't care for the latest generative AI enhancement.)What is Alexa+?The new Alexa is much like the old one, but now behaves a bit more like other generative AI assistants, including ChatGPT. In addition to simple requests and questions, Alexa+ can handle more complex queries and understand context (meaning one complex question can be followed by another, without needing to repeat yourself). For all the hullabaloo around generative AI, contextual awareness is really one of the big improvements users will notice with their digital assistants.    \nAmazon has a big vision for Alexa+. It still wants you to use it to control smart home devices, run timers, check the weather, and catch up on the news, but it also wants users to take advantage of \"agentic\" tasks, or actions that the AI can handle on your behalf. In theory, agentic AI allows you to ask the AI to order dinner to-go, make reservations at restaurants, schedule an Uber, or book a home repair. I'm still not sold on the capabilities of agentic AI assistants, and I imagine most people will continue to use Alexa+ the way they used regular old Alexa, (e.g. asking \"Is it cold today?\" or telling it to \"set a timer for 10 minutes,\" or ordering it to \"Play 'Manchild' by Sabrina Carpenter on repeat\"), but what do I know? Maybe Alexa+ really will change the way people interact with their Echo devices.How much Alexa+ will cost youIf you're interested in Amazon's newest AI assistant, there are three different ways to try it—one free, and two paid. How to use Alexa+ for freeThe most basic, Alexa+ chat, is totally free of charge. You can try it by heading to alexa.com or using the Alexa app for iOS or Android, where you can talk to Alexa in a chat window, ala ChatGPT. Amazon says users can get \"quick answers, plan research, and explore new topics.\" But the thing is, you can't use Alexa+ chat for any of the things you probably want to have Alexa+ do. It is solely a web-based chatbot experience, not something you can connect to your Alexa-enabled devices. If you're interested in the full Alexa+ package, you'll need to pay Amazon one way or another. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPrime Members get a free subscriptionThe good news is, you might have already paid Amazon for the privilege, even if you didn't realize it: Currently, Amazon is offering all Prime members full access to Alexa+, including via the chatbot and through Alexa-enabled devices. Alexa+ also works with other Amazon services that come free with Prime, including Prime Video and Amazon Music. Seeing as over half the U.S. population has a Prime account, chances are good that if you're at all interested, you already have access to Alexa+. How to use Alexa+ without PrimeMaybe you're one of the rare unicorns who doesn't have a Prime account, but still wants to try Alexa+ on an Echo smart speaker. In that case, Amazon will offer you the full experience for a cool $19.99/month. That's a slightly ridiculous price, seeing as a full Prime membership (with all the added benefits, from Prime Video to free shipping) will run you $14.99/month (or $139 per year). You definitely save money by subscribing to the latter, which is probably a big part of Amazon's motivation here—Jeff Bezos will never truly rest until everyone uses Amazon to buy everything.How to enable Alexa+If you opt for either of the paid options, you can set up Alexa+ by simply telling your Alexa-enabled device, \"Upgrade to Alexa+.\" You can also use Alexa+ by logging into your Amazon account on alexa.com. And as noted above, you can certainly opt to keep the old Alexa assistant for the time being, whether whether you have Prime or not. While Amazon may do away with the legacy assistant in the future, it isn't forcing anyone to switch just yet.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That's 149 trillion gigabytes, or 149 billion terabytes—whichever helps you wrap your head around that gigantic number. Suffice it to say, the internet is a big place. It's so big, in fact, that you can't access all of it the same way. There are actually different tiers to the web, and depending on with tier a piece of content you're looking for is on, you may or may not be able to view it—even if you know where to find it. That's the crux of the difference between the \"surface\" web, and the \"deep\" web. These are two separate parts of the internet that are also part of the larger world wide web. While these two tiers are quite different, you've visited content on both of them before. In fact, you likely visited both surface web pages and deep web pages today, multiple times, without ever realizing it.    The surface web, also known as the visible web, is really true to its name: This is the part of the web you can easily access through search engines, as they are indexed by platforms like Google. As a rule of thumb, if you can google it, it's on the surface web. The article you're reading right now is on the surface web, for example. Maybe you found it by searching \"difference between surface web and deep web\" on Google. The same applies to Lifehacker as a whole, as well as articles on websites like Mashable, CNET, and PCMag.\nYou likely spend a good amount of your internet time on the surface web, on websites both old and new. Forums like Reddit are largely fully represented on the surface web, as are some Instagram pages. Listings for products you can buy on websites like Amazon and Best Buy are surface web pages. Video platforms like YouTube are very much the surface web, including TikTok—though the experience for the latter is not optimized for web browsers. Legacy websites like AddictingGames (which is still playable in 2026), as well as the site for the 1996 movie Space Jam are the surface web. A lot of the surface web is made of up individual articles, which makes sense, since articles still make up a large amount of search engine results.      Like the surface of the ocean, the surface web is just a fraction of the internet as a whole. Back in 2017, some estimates claimed the surface web made up just 10% of the entire internet. That's still a huge number of websites, which tells you how big the overall web really is.What is the deep web?If the surface web is everything you can find via Google, the deep web is everything you can't. The deep web is much larger than the surface web, and is compromised of websites that are not readily accessible from search engines or direct URLs. They're often locked away behind authentication. That means you need at least a username and password to access them, and in many cases, they require an additional form of authentication as well. The article you're reading is on the surface web, but the software (content management system, or CMS) we use to write and publish the article is not—our CMS is still a website, but it's not something you can find in a Google search, and even if you knew the direct URL, you wouldn't have access. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's the same with the many sites you access that only you have permission to view. Think about something like Gmail: The service's homepage is accessible to everyone, and it's something that pops up when searching \"Gmail,\" but to access your Gmail inbox, you need to log in. Once you do, your inbox is accessible via the website, but it's not like anyone can see it with a URL, and they certainly can't find your inbox from a Google search. It's the same story with your Facebook feed, YouTube account, or your banking information. These are all accessible in your web browser as websites, but you need to log in to view them. That's also the case for services and subscriptions. Think about  stuff like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO: These are all accessible in your web browser, which means you're streaming the content on individual web pages. But the players on those web pages cannot be accessed from Google, even if the landing pages for a particular show or movie can be. In order to actually watch or listen to the content, you need to sign into your account. That's not the case with all streaming services, of course: Happy Gilmore on Tubi is a surface web page, since it's indexed on Google. Some of the deep web is also made up of pages you'll never see, such as protocols for identifying user accounts and running payments behind the scenes. It's not all paywalled content. What about the dark web?Maybe you've also heard about the dark web, but don't quite know what it is. As such, you might conflate the deep web and the dark web, but the two are not identical. In fact, the dark web is a part of the deep web; it's just the part you can't access with a traditional web browser. In order to access the dark web, you need a specialized browser, like Tor, and knowledge of the unique dark web URLs, which typically end in .onion instead of .com or .org.

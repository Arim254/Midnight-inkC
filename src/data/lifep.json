Luckily, Marshall is offering these Monitor III ANC earbuds, which offer a cool retro look. And right now, they're available for the lowest price ever, at $279.99 (down from $379.99), beating the heavyweights from Sony and Bose on price.\nThese Monitor III headphones feature the iconic Marshall script logo, a retro brass control knob (instead of touch buttons), and a textured black vinyl finish that mimics Marshall guitar amps. Other than the looks, the most impressive part is the battery life. These will last you for 70 hours of ANC playback (and 100 hours without ANC). That is a staggering number; for comparison, the Sony XM6 gets you 30-40 hours of playback per charge. The headphones are also collapsible, folding into a small ball. They come with a hard-shell travel case and are pretty lightweight, too, at 250 grams. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack here, but the box does include a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for wired listening.They feature the signature Marshall sound, warm and punchy. They are tuned for listening to rock, heavy metal and guitar-heavy music, and offer a more fun sound profile compared to Sony or Bose, which can sound a bit more flat or balanced.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn its review, PCMag gave the Monitor IIIs a 4.0 star rating, noting that they deliver a \"pleasing audio signature, a comfortable fit with intuitive controls, easy portability, and excellent battery life.\" \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts. If you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)To pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning. \nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app: Gesture navigation: Swipe up and hold2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + OverviewNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons. The new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCurrently, there's a waitlist to sign up for ChatGPT Health, and over time it will roll out to all users. At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching. YouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one. If you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search. \nHow to remove YouTube Shorts from searchTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.Other changes to YouTube filtersIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.    Finally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters. \n            \n    ",

When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.When it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Soundcore\n                    \n    \nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies. See personalized, AI-powered snapshots Gmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.AI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\" \nGet AI Overviews via Gmail searchGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI will proofread your emailsFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure.

He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends. You can follow Justin on Mastodon and Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter, Connectivity.\n        \n        \n            Areas of Expertise\n        \n        Read Full Bio\n    \n\n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        January 9, 2026\n                \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n    \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Justin Pot\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Most people haven't actively managed a firewall in at least a decade, assuming they ever have. But keeping track of which applications are using the internet—and how much data they're using—is still useful at times, as is blocking apps from accessing the net entirely.While you're traveling, for example, internet access might be limited, so it's a good idea to cut off applications that constantly churn through data. But even while at home, it's a good security practice to review which applications are connecting to the internet. And while macOS comes with a firewall, it's not really a useful tool for that.Which is why I like FireWally. This totally free application, offered by the Ukraine-based indie Mac developers Nektony, isn't a tool for power users—it's streamlined and user friendly. Click the menu bar icon and you'll see a list of applications using the internet. You can see a summary of all traffic today, in the past hour, or monitor incoming traffic in real time.\nBeside every application is its data usage. You can see a breakdown of inbound and outbound traffic for any application by hovering the mouse over it. You can block any application from accessing the internet by toggling the switch.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWhat if you don't recognize an application? I, traditionally, ended up copying the name of the application and pasting it into a search engine. FireWally tries to save you some time by providing AI-generated summaries of each application using Apple Intelligence (assuming your Mac supports that feature). It's a useful way to quickly remind yourself what a particular application is, or to identify one you don't recognize.It's a very streamlined application, but perfect for anyone hoping to understand a bit more about how much data their various Mac applications are using. Give it a spin if you're looking for a simple firewall application.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But in a market crowded with ANC earbuds that do little more than meet the bare minimum, these justify their price tag by leaning into thoughtful features, sound quality, and build that go beyond the basics. Right now, a brand-new pair of Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 earbuds are going for $279.99 (originally $399) on Woot, their lowest price ever. \nCompared to the Pi7, the Pi8 has improved noise cancellation, higher-grade 12mm drivers with Carbon Cone technology, and an upgraded digital-to-analog converter alongside an updated digital signal processor. Its charging case also functions as a Bluetooth transceiver, making it seamlessly functional with in-flight entertainment when you’re on the go. CNET, in a glowing review, dubbed them “easily among the best-sounding earbuds out there,” and they also have a more secure and comfortable fit than their predecessors, making them more ergonomic. The review does note that they don’t have a 3.5mm headphone port but do include a USB-C to 3.5mm cable adaptor.The Pi8 earbuds have the latest Bluetooth 5.4 with support for aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless for top-quality wireless streaming, as well as an IP54 dust and sweat rating. The case offers around 6.5 hours per charge with ANC on, going up to 13.5 hours with the charging case and a 15-minute quick charge that gives you 2 hours of playback. While 6.5 hours is decent, it’s not best-in-class compared to competitors that reach the eight to 10 hour mark. And although it has three built-in mics for calls, users also note that background noise can occasionally leak through.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUltimately, if premium sound quality, music fidelity, and rare features like wired retransmission are at the top of your priority list, the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 earbuds are a comfy and travel-friendly option with competitive ANC. However, if your top priorities are maximum noise cancellation and battery life, you may want to consider the (lower-priced) Bose QuietComfort earbuds instead. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The catalog is small at the moment—only 14 cassettes—but already really interesting. There's a bootleg cassette of music played at a Spanish nightclub in the late 1990s (lots of squelchy noises and relentless bass) and a 90-minute recording of New York hip hop station WBLS captured in '94 (Warren G.'s \"Regulate\" represent), amid more mysterious choices, like this haunting recording from a \"destroyed cassette tape found on the side of the coast highway near Heraklion\" in Greece; this tape full of ominous noises found in a parking lot in Tbilisi, Georgia;  tape of binary code from Barcelona; and a cassette recorded in the USSR featurng 1970s pop hits. I love how each cassette is treated like an important archeological object, because in a way, they are—discreet time capsules made more poignant by the hiss and warp that speaks to the time that's passed since this audio was captured and the ephemeral nature of analogue recording. From musical snapshots to accidental field recordings, these tapes are fascinating for there mere existence in the modern day, where the question of who recorded them and why adds a layer of mystery to each one. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThe ongoing cassette tape revivalIntertapes could be viewed as a reflection of the growing cassette tape revival, a movement that celebrates the outdated format. Since they hit the market in 1963, audiophiles have generally considered cassette tapes an inferior format to vinyl—tapes are more rugged than records, but the sound quality is markedly worse. The spread of CDs and streaming music pretty much killed off commercial cassette releases by the early 2000s, and it's easy to see why: Digital music doesn't hiss or degrade. Cassettes have a more narrow dynamic range. You can  instantly select tracks on a CD or MP3 player, and it will never play at a slightly wrong speed, unspool, or melt on your car dashboard. Bonus: You never have to rewind them to hear a song again.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMost people didn't see it at the time, but when tapes slipped into obsolescence, we lost something real and tangible. Dropouts, distortion, and warp are evidence of life. Cassette tape compression is a unique sonic aesthetic that conveys warmth and nostalgia. And then there's the way they impart meaning into the act of \"listening to music.\" Starting a Spotify stream is frictionless, optimized, and weightless, while cassettes are physical objects with histories that defy the disconnection of the digital space. You own the music on tapes in a way you never own information being served to you by a tech company. A friend handing you a cassette of their favorite songs is meaningful in a way a link to playlist will never be, and your Spotify playlist will never be found by the side of the road near Heraklion, to be pondered over by future people. Yes, by digitizing them, Intertapes is removing some of the qualities that make these recording special—but it's also preserving them, at least for now (if you've ever tried following a decades-old weblink, you know the internet is ephemeral too).How to submit your own tapes to IntertapeIf you're of a certain age, you probably have a dusty cassette or two hanging around somewhere. Don't let it molder in a desk drawer. Describe the origin of your recording and a background story, scan a picture of your tape, and email [email protected] to arrange you submission to the site. This collection really deserves to grow. \n            \n    ",

Over the last few months, I've noticed an uptick in people discussing something called \"cognitive overload,\" citing it as a potential reason for a decline in output. The phrase stuck out to me as one of those buzzy terms that has the potential to be overused until it's meaningless—but at its core, it certainly has a real, clear definition that can be helpful tool in maximizing productivity. Basically, cognitive overload is what happens when you're inundated with more information than your brain can process, so your brain just gives up altogether, making hard to focus on anything at all. Here's what to know about it and what to do once you identify it. What causes cognitive overload?You know all those jokes on social media about how a single news item or food product from modern times would kill a person born just a few centuries ago? They're funny and hyperbolic, but they're grounded in the fact that while the ways in which we produce things and share information have advanced wildly, the human brain has basically remained the same. We say it all the time but it bears repeating: We're just not cut out to handle the onslaught of stimuli we get on a daily basis.\nThink of how many times your phone lights up on a given day. I just checked my screentime app and discovered that though it's only early afternoon, I've gotten 150 notifications straight to my lock screen already today. It's only Wednesday, so I'm averaging 213 a day, which my phone assures me is down 20% from last week and I'm quite sure I'll pick back up by the time Sunday rolls around. Considering that a few months ago, I redid all my phone settings so not all of my notifications got blasted to my lock screen, this is concerning. That's just a lot of information to constantly see. As it turns out, text-based info is the main cause of cognitive overload, at least according to one study. Emails, Slack and Teams messages, texts, calendar notifications—the never-ending stream of these bad boys is a major contributor to the overall feeling of being unable to process or do anything. If you think about an average day when you've felt too zapped to work, it probably included plenty of those. Audio-visual stimuli are less debilitating, according to the study, so a Zoom or phone call or a manager stopping by your desk may not trip you up as badly. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nBeyond feeling like you can't even think straight or like you're too overwhelmed to take action on any one task, you may be able to recognize cognitive overload from other signs. If incoming messages make you feel frustrated or detached, for instance, no matter what they say, this could be happening to you. That's actually the symptom I experience most often, for what it's worth. When I'm overwhelmed by too much information, I find myself thinking, \"What do you want?!\" every time my phone lights up, before I even see who is reaching out. (Sorry, Mom.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow I'm battling cognitive overloadAs I was going through the study and thinking over cognitive overload, I realized I've already been implementing a few tricks that may have been helping me avoid it. As mentioned above, I banned my least-used apps from sending me notifications a few months ago. For years, I've also tinkered with my MacBook settings so I don't get any form of push notification on my computer. My phone is next to me at all times; there's no good reason for the top right corner of my laptop screen to be whacking me with the same notifications the phone is already showing me. A few other tried-and-true productivity approaches came to mind for me once I got a good grasp of what cognitive overload actually is. The one-touch rule of inbox management could be useful for you if you find that messages get you worked up. With that, you open each message as you get it and make an instant decision about what to do with the contents. It might seem counterintuitive to face each incoming message head-on if you're trying to avoid feeling burned out by the sheer volume of them, but I've found that when I see a message preview at the top of my screen and do nothing about it, it nags at me all day. Addressing it instantly helps me clear my mind and keep working. Otherwise, the way you go about battling this is going to be pretty subjective, although I do have one more recommendation: If you're not familiar with the Pomodoro technique, get familiar now. With it, you work for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) before taking a small break (usually five). When you're in those focus sessions, you should be completely distraction-free, putting your devices in Do Not Disturb mode or even using specialized apps to block other, distracting apps. Knowing you have to work seriously for a certain amount of time can help get you in the zone and push you away from information and decision paralysis while knowing you eventually get a break can help you stay relaxed as you go. \n            \n    ",

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026. While the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.How Ford AI Assistant worksFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time. \nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.   \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWill Ford AI Assistant actually be useful?As someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.Of course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.  \n            \n    ",

But if I hadn't upgraded last year, I would have gone for the Series 11, just for the extra battery life upgrade. I usually like to wait for discounts before upgrading, though, and if you're like me, Amazon has some good news: While the Series 11 only came out four months ago, it's already down to its lowest price ever. You can get the 42mm Series 11 model for $299 (down from $399) and the 46mm Series 11 model for $329 (down from $429). That's a discount of $100 across the board.\nThe Series 10 was the one with the big redesign, but the Series 11 upgrade is about the smaller, quality-of-life upgrades, the chief of which is the battery life. For the first time in 10 years, the Apple Watch's battery life jumped from 18 hours to 24 hours. I already use some tweaks to make my Series 10 last for two days, so the Series 11 model will go even further still.The screen is brighter at 2,000 nits peak brightness, and Apple now uses a Ion-X glass for better wide-angle viewing. It's also twice as scratch-resistant as before, IP6X dust resistant, and swim-proof (WR50). And if you plan to go for the cellular mode, you also get 5G for the first time in an Apple Watch. There are also new software features like background hypertension notifications, and a new Sleep Score (though they're available on the older models as well).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOverall, the Series 11 makes for a solid upgrade if you're using an Apple Watch Series 7 or 8. PCMag gave the Apple Watch Series 11 a 4.5 star \"Outstanding\" rating, and an Editor's Choice award. PCMag notes that \"while the watch's design and sensors haven’t changed much this generation, they remain at the head of the class.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        The USB-C charging port is likely to remain ubiquitous on phones for the foreseeable future—at least until the engineers at Apple figure out how to make the long-rumored portless iPhone—but this little socket is more versatile than you may have realized. Here are four other ways to put your USB-C port to use, no matter what your make and model of phone—from freeing up space on your handset to boosting your on-the-go productivity. It's almost like adding extra superpowers to your handset.Attach external storage\n    \n            \n            Both iOS and Android have integrated file management apps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can plug external USB storage devices of almost every description into your phone, just as you can with your laptop or desktop computer. Lifehacker has written before about how this works on an iPhone, and many Android phones offer the same functionality, with the default file browser app also able to see the external drive.\nYou may need an adapter of some description, and you may need to make sure the USB drive is formatted in a particular way (a quick web search for the details for your particular phone model will tell you if this is the case). but often, you can just plug in your drive and the phone will figure out what's what.This is a helpful for backing up photos and videos without paying a monthly fee for cloud storage, or simply to free up some storage space on your device. It's also a quick and easy way of getting files onto your phone, whether that's audio or video files you want to play without having to stream them, or books or documents you need to review during a long trip when you won't be able to rely on getting a good signal.Put videos on a bigger screenMany handsets—the latest iPhones and Pixel phones included—can output video over a USB-C connection. One scenario where this is useful is if you're in a hotel room and you want to get a movie up on the room television without having to mess with wifi or streaming protocols.This can be quite fiddly in terms of the cables you need and how they attach to the TV, but if you do some research around your particular phone model and the inputs you want to connect to, you should be able to get it working without too much trouble. Here's Apple's guide for the cables and adapters you need for the iPhone, for example.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nIf you have a Samsung Galaxy device, then it will probably support Samsung DeX. This is a desktop environment (like Windows or macOS) that you can run on an external monitor or TV from your phone, enabling you to not only play videos on the larger display, but also use social media, web browsing, and productivity apps too.Connect a gaming controller\n    \n            \n            The Backbone One is an example of a gaming controller you can attach.\n                                        Credit: Backbone\n                    \n    \nThere are some great mobile games around for iOS and Android, but using touchscreen controls can be awkward: You're just about to blast an alien spaceship out of existence when you tap the wrong part of the display and turn down the brightness instead. It's not ideal, but a dedicated gaming controller can help.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLifehacker has covered some of these controllers in the past, and many can hook up via your phone's USB-C port—giving you a solid and stable connection to the gaming action without any lag. You won't need to charge the controller either if it's hooked up via USB-C, as it'll use the power coming from your phone's battery.One of the best examples of this is the $99.99 Backbone One controller. It works with Android phones and iPhones, and gives you a gaming boost in titles such as Fortnite and Call of Duty. It can also work really well if you're streaming games from your Microsoft or Sony console to your phone over wifi.Attach a mouse and keyboardThere are yet more peripherals you can plug into your smartphone, including two that can harness its versatility as a productivity device: a mouse and a keyboard. This works on a broad range of iPhone and Android handsets—here are the instructions for plugging a wired mouse into a Samsung Galaxy phones, for instance. (You can also connect these peripherals via Bluetooth.)Admittedly you're probably not going to dig out a full size keyboard every time you send a text message, but if you've got a lot of emails or a long report to write while you're on the go, a travel keyboard can be very helpful. If you've got a foldable phone with a larger screen, then you've got yourself a decent portable workstation.It's even possible to connect up a mouse and a keyboard together via a USB-C hub, with maybe a memory card slot as an added bonus. Just keep an eye on power usage: If you're connecting multiple accessories, look for a hub that you can also connect your charger to, so your phone battery isn't constantly running down.\n            ",

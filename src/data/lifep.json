It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited. As reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.If you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jake Peterson\n                    \n    \nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes. Thankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

While the root causes of these problems tend to vary, there are some broad fixes you can try that should go some way to giving you an iPhone keyboard experience you can rely on—besides waiting for the next bug-squashing iOS update from Apple.Reset the keyboard dictionary on your iPhone\n    \n            \n            Resetting the keyboard on iOS.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOver time, the iOS keyboard tries to build up smarter autocorrect suggestions for you, but these aren't always helpful: The further away these suggestions get from the defaults, the worse they can get, which risks turning your sentences into gibberish. To clean the slate and go back to the beginning, open up Settings, then tap General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary. Type in your handset's unlock code, then choose Reset Dictionary.Add custom words and shortcuts to your iPhone's dictionaryThis may seem to contradict the previous tip, but by explicitly teaching your iPhone the words it often gets wrong, you can reduce the likelihood of those frustrating moments where iOS suddenly replaces the word you were typing with something else (e.g. \"he'll yeah\" or \"what the duck\"). From Settings, tap General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. Tap on the + (plus) button in the top right corner, then enter your word or phrase—you can add a shortcut for it too to help you type it more quickly, but it's optional. Tap Save to confirm.\nAdjust other iPhone keyboard settings\n    \n            \n            If a keyboard setting isn't helping, turn it off.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are more keyboard settings that are worth taking a look at under General > Keyboard in iOS Settings. You can turn Auto-Correction off completely, for example, and disable Slide to Type if your fingers have a tendency to slip across the keyboard. There are additional tweaks you can make through the Accessibility menu in Settings: Under Touch > Touch Accommodations, you can change the sensitivity of double-taps and press-and-holds, among other settings, which may help improve typing accuracy.Change your iPhone's keyboard layoutThere's not a lot you can do with the iPhone keyboard layout to improve your typing experience and eliminate bugs, but there is a one-handed mode you can try in order to minimize glitches and ensure your keypresses match up with what's on screen. To switch to the one-handed layout, tap and hold on the globe icon in the lower left corner of the keyboard, then tap one of the icons at the bottom of the pop-up menu: You can move the keyboard to the left, or the right, or put it back to normal.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSwitch to a different keyboard on the iPhone\n    \n            \n            You've got several options for iOS keyboards.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you're still struggling with the vagaries of the keyboard on iOS, you can always opt to install a third-party alternative: We've covered a bunch here, including Gboard and SwiftKey, and they typically offer more customization options than the Apple default. Once you've installed an alternative keyboard or two, you can manage them from iOS Settings by choosing General > Keyboard > Keyboards. To actually switch between keyboards when typing, press and hold on the globe icon (lower left).Or avoid a keyboard altogetherThere are also some more extreme measures you can take that maybe haven't crossed your mind. The first is to use a Bluetooth keyboard (via Bluetooth in Settings), which will give you a more convenient (if less portable) way of typing text into your iPhone. The second is to ensure dictation is enabled in General > Keyboard in Settings, then tap the mic icon in the lower right corner of the keyboard, and speak out your text. You can handle emojis, line breaks, text editing, and more, using your voice.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        For all its faults as a platform, YouTube’s video player functionality is easily among the best online. It streams reliably to almost every device you can think of, in your choice of both video quality and playback speed. But it’s the array of hidden features and interface tricks that push it over the edge for me. (Other video players, take note.) Here are 10 of my favorite hacks that make YouTube easier to use.Search YouTube video transcripts with Ctrl-FAlmost every video on YouTube either has an official or auto-generated subtitled track. While these are mainly used for captioning, you can also pull up this transcript on the web and use Ctrl-F (or Cmd-F on Macs) to search for keywords in a video and jump straight to the part you want to see.This feature has been around for a while, but YouTube has shuffled around where to find the transcript from time to time. As of this writing, the most reliable way to find it is to open the video’s description, scroll to the bottom, and click Show transcript to open it up in a side bar.\nSet a sleep timer for long videosFour hour video essays and ASMR streams can be great background noise to help you fall asleep. However, if you want to avoid getting jolted awake by that one really loud joke you forgot about, you can set a sleep timer to pause any video after a certain amount of time.On web or mobile, click the Settings icon on any given video and choose Sleep timer (on mobile, it may be under Settings > More). You can choose a timer ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. You can also automatically pause once the current video is over, which is helpful if you usually have auto-play enabled.Link to specific timestamps in a videoOne of YouTube’s handiest features is the ability to deep-link to a specific second of any video, like I did in the last section. There are several ways to get a precise timestamp link. If you’re on the web, you can right click a video and choose “Copy video URL at current time.” And on mobile, when you click the Share icon, you can tap the toggle next to the timestamp to add the precise link.If none of those are options, you can even create your own timestamp link. At the end of any video URL, add “&t=01h05m47s”, replacing the numbers with the specific time you want to link to. You can use any combination of hours, minutes, and seconds to specify the point in the video you want.Use arrow keys or double-taps for quick navigationMost video players at this point have some kind of “Hang on, what did they just say?” button that lets you skip 5-10 seconds backward or forward. YouTube has several. The most straightforward, on mobile, is the double-tap. Tap twice on the left side of the screen to go backwards 10 seconds, and on the right to go forward. Keep tapping to move forward or back by further increments of 10 seconds.On the web, you have even finer grain control. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move 5 seconds back and forth. Alternatively, you can use the J-K-L keys to move in 10 second increments (with K being used to pause the video). This latter method is borrowed from video editors, making it a handy way to keep your muscle memory consistent if you do a lot of editing.Move frame-by-frame with keyboard shortcutsYouTubers love putting walls of text in a single frame of a video that you have to pause to be able to read. On mobile, the only way to read these–or examine any specific frame–is to back up and try to time your pause perfectly. On the web, however, there’s a better way. While paused on a video, you can press the , (comma) or . (period) keys to move back or forward exactly one frame at a time. You can hold these keys down to slowly move through frames as well.Quickly fast-forward with a long-pressIt’s pretty common knowledge at this point that you can play YouTube videos at 2x (or higher) speed, but what if you only want to rush through a small part of a video, like an ad read? On the mobile version of YouTube, there’s a handy gesture to do just that, without changing your default playback speed.Simply long-press and hold anywhere on the video while it’s playing. This will temporarily cause the video to play back at 2x speed, until you lift your finger. If you’re already watching at 2x or higher, it won’t play any faster (or slower) than your current speed, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSet your video quality defaultsYouTube generally does a pretty good job of automatically deciding what video quality to stream at, balancing fidelity with bandwidth demands. You can manually override this on a per-video basis, but on mobile, you have a few more options to get broader control.In the YouTube mobile app, head to Settings > Quality. Here, you can set separate quality defaults for video when you’re streaming over mobile networks or wifi, as well as audio quality. The latter is particularly helpful if you use YouTube for listening to music or podcasts. If your wifi is reliably fast, it can be worth it to set higher quality defaults, rather than manually change each video’s resolution whenever you notice the quality looks degraded. Use incognito mode to preserve your suggestionsYouTube can get overly eager to show you videos even vaguely similar to one you watched before. If you’d rather not get a feed full of videos on how to fix a door, you can use an incognito tab to browse without contributing to your algorithm’s history. It’s a little tougher on mobile, but fortunately the YouTube app has an option for that.In the mobile YouTube app, navigate to the You tab. Along the top of the screen, tap “Turn on incognito.” This will let you search and browse without any algorithmic recommendations or contributing to your history. You can manually turn off incognito mode, or it will automatically turn off after 90 minutes of inactivity. Note, if you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, none of your benefits will apply while you’re browsing incognito.Remove unwanted videos from your historyIf you forget to turn on incognito mode, you can still remove videos from your browsing history so they won’t muck up your recommendations. To do this, head to your YouTube history on mobile or the web, tap the three-dot menu next to the video in question, and choose “Remove from watch history.”This is usually enough to prevent a video from becoming the algorithm’s latest fixation, but it also means you won’t be able to find the video in your history again. If you want provide any kind of direct feedback, like a thumbs down or a report, make sure to do that first. Otherwise, if you navigate to the video again, it will be re-added to your history.Master even more keyboard shortcutsBeyond basic navigation, YouTube on the web has a plethora of helpful keyboard shortcuts that you might never encounter that are worth knowing about. Some of them are pretty niche, but you never know when they can come in handy:Up and Down arrows: Turn the volume on a video up or down in 5% increments.Shift+> and Shift+<:> Speed up or slow down the current video playback speedM: Mute the current video.F: Enter/exit fullscreen mode.T: Enter/exit Theater modeShift+N: Play the next video in your queue or playlist.Shift+P: Play the previous video in your queue or playlist.Ctrl/Cmd+Left or Right arrow keys: Navigate to the next or previous chapter in a video.\n            ",

With its latest update, Google Chrome for desktop now has three new productivity features: Split View, PDF annotations, and the ability to save downloads directly to Google Drive. These features are targeted at both regular and enterprise users, the company says, so you don't need to worry about Workspace exclusivity. Let's take a look at each new feature and how you can best use it.Split View lets you boost your productivity\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nOver the years, the internet browser has become a super app of sorts, since it has access to so many useful sites and web apps. In Chrome, I often find myself taking notes while attending meetings online, or keeping a second tab open for research while I write articles. For many people, a single Chrome tab or window is no longer enough, and with that in mind, Google's added Split View to the desktop version of its browser.Split View merges two tabs and displays them in the same window. You can think of it like the split-screen view in old school video games. You can use Split View by right-clicking any tab and selecting Add Tab to New Split View. For now, Chrome allows you to have a maximum of two tabs side by side in Split View, although I hope you'll eventually be able to add more in the future. In its current form, the feature is great for using Google Docs while watching an educational video, or similar two-tab use cases. Finally, no more opening single tabs in separate windows and then resizing them into your own, makeshift split view.\nYou can easily drag the slider in between the two tabs to give one tab more screen space than the other. Or for more control, you can click the Split View button to the left of the address bar and select the Arrange Split View menu (this is also available if you right click the merged tabs in your tab bar). This is an easy way to quickly reverse the order of the two tabs, separate them, or close just one of the tabs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate PDFs in Chrome\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLet's be honest: Chrome is probably the PDF viewer that most people use. No matter how many fancy PDF editing apps I or my colleagues recommend, for the most part, you're going to search for and open PDFs in your browser. Luckily, now you no longer have to use a different app for basic annotations. Chrome's desktop PDF Viewer now has tools for highlighting text, adding notes, and even making digital signatures. You're still going to need a different app for advanced PDF edits, but Chrome is now capable enough to handle the basics.Save PDF files directly to Google Drive\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhenever you download a PDF file using Google Chrome, it defaults to saving them to the Downloads folder on your computer, or to another location on your hard drive. On desktop, Google now lets you save these files directly to your Google Drive account. This can be very useful if you want to keep your local storage clear. When you open a PDF file in Chrome, you'll see a Google Drive icon in the toolbar, next to the download button. Clicking the Google Drive icon will automatically save it to the cloud storage service, in a new folder called \"Saved from Chrome.\"\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n    \n            \n            There's a new Create music button in Gemini.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.When you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\n    \n            \n            You can get some help with your prompting if you need it.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n    \n            \n            You also get cover art with your artificial tunes.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them.

As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.WhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.Speaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: WhatsApp\n                    \n    \nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.Still, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.WhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.AI assistants are coming to CarPlay in iOS 26.4As spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.According to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant. \nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstall the iOS 26.4 at your own riskThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The goal was to extend the lifespan of the battery, by limiting how often you fully charge it up. Batteries age with each full charging cycle, so by preventing your battery from charging to 100% every time you keep it plugged in, you can slow down that aging process, which means your device will last longer in between charges.  Now, that same feature is coming to your Mac. Apple is currently testing the feature as part of macOS 26.4, which means you'll soon be able to ask macOS to stop charging your laptop once the battery level hits a specific charge level. This feature is great for anyone that keeps their MacBook plugged in all the time while working: It'll allow you to ask your MacBook to stop charging when the battery is at 80%, or at any charge level up to 100%.Battery optimization is nothing new for macOS\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTo be clear, your MacBook ships with a battery optimization feature already, which is enabled by default. This feature automatically slows down your MacBook's charging speed once the charge level reaches 80%. Based on your past usage habits, macOS waits to continue charging your MacBook until it thinks you'll need to use the laptop again. So, if you plug in your MacBook at night, and you typically take it off the charger at 8 a.m., it might keep your MacBook at 80% until 7 a.m., then charge the extra 20% over the following hour.  \nYou can check if it's enabled by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen, and going to System Settings > Battery. Click the i button next to Battery Health and you'll see that Optimized Battery Charging is enabled.But this is all automated, based on how you use your MacBook. What makes this new charging feature different is that you set the charge limit manually. That way, if you work with your MacBook plugged in all day, it doesn't need to charge to 100% whenever it thinks it should. Instead, you can keep it at any charge limit between 80% and 100%. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to enable charge limit on your MacBookThis new feature is available with macOS 26.4, which is currently available in the Developer Beta channel for Mac updates. I strongly recommend against installing this on your primary MacBook, as issues with the beta could mean losing data or bricking your laptop. Unless Apple decides to pull the feature, it should ship to everyone with the general release of macOS 26.4. If you have a spare MacBook where you've installed macOS 26.4 beta, you can go to System Settings > Battery, where you'll see the \"Charge Limit\" feature listed under Battery Health. Here, you can manually limit the maximum charging level between 80% and 100%.Third-party battery management apps are betterWhile Apple's methods to reduce battery aging are good enough for most people, you can do a lot more with third-party battery management apps. Those apps will allow you to do more than just set a charge limit. For instance, you can start charging the Mac when the battery hits 50% and stop charging when it's at 80%, or stop charging if the battery is too hot.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Samsung’s brightest OLED TV thus far, released in 2025, is the S95F, praised for its picture quality and surprisingly impressive sound. Right now, a 65-inch refurbished Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV is just $1,899, which is over $1,000 off its list price.\nThis TV's deep blacks, dramatic contrast, and “very bright OLED panel”, as PCMag describes it, are the standout features on this large-screen 4K TV. Beyond improved brightness that maxes out at a striking 2,386 nits, it also features fantastic color performance and a powerful, advanced 4.2.2-channel speaker system that reduces the need for an external speaker or soundbar. The TV has a nearly bezel-less design and a One Connect box to minimize cable clutter.The S95F also has some of the best anti-glare tech, which is rare for an OLED. While the LG G5 is technically brighter, its anti-glare system doesn’t perform as well. The S95F’s matte anti-reflection coating drastically reduces glare and is designed specifically to perform well in bright rooms, which is a major perk if the room your TV is in gets a lot of daylight. It supports HDR10 and HDR10+ content at 120Hz, with up to 165Hz variable refresh rate  and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.  Like other Samsung TVs, this one doesn’t support Dolby Vision.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe TV is covered by Woot’s 90-day limited warranty, and ships free for Amazon Prime users (otherwise, shipping is $6). Since it’s refurbished, it may have minimal signs of wear, but that won’t affect performance.\n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        There's little worse than losing an hour or two of hard work, just by clicking on the wrong button or pressing the wrong key in Microsoft Word—a mistake that sees your well-crafted document (or a sizable portion of it) disappear before your eyes.A slip of the fingers isn't the only way you can potentially lose work, either. Maybe you just have the misfortune to be busy at your computer when a power outage happens—taking your desktop, Microsoft Word, and your unsaved work along with it.However, before you begin all over again, there are some tricks you can try to bring your work back. \nUse Undo (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z)\n    \n            \n            Word keeps an undo history.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSometimes, all you need is the undo command—hit Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (macOS) to undo your last action in Word. It might be enough to restore that table you accidentally deleted, or bring back that huge block of text you moved to the clipboard and have since lost track of.This won't save you from a power outage, and it doesn't include all actions (it won't bring back a file you've closed, for example). However, it'll work a lot of the time when you've made a mistake, and Word always keeps a record of your last 100 actions in the app, so you can go back a fair way.There's also an undo button up in the top left corner of the Word interface: Click on this to undo the last action, or click the arrow next to it to see a list of previous actions and choose where you want to go back to. To the right of the undo button is the redo button, which works the same way but in the opposite direction.Open previous file versions\n    \n            \n            Accessing previous versions in Word.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWord also has a file version history feature you can utilize to bring back lost work: It essentially saves past versions of your document at regular intervals, so you can go back in time, and even all the way back to the file's creation. It's like a super undo, which works between app restarts as well.In Word for Windows, you can find these older incarnations of your document by heading to File > Info > Version History. If you're using Word on macOS, it's File > Browse Version History. A new sidebar opens on the right, showing all the available previous versions, and the date and time they were saved.There is a caveat to this, though, which is you have to have your document saved in the cloud (in OneDrive) for this to work. If you're working with a local file that's only saved on your computer and you try and access version history, you'll be prompted to save it to OneDrive instead (which will turn on version history).Find unsaved documents on your system\n    \n            \n            Unsaved documents are sometimes still available.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWord actually saves files temporarily to your computer every so often, so if the program crashes without warning, you should see an autorecovery dialog pop up the next time you load Word, asking if you want to recover the old file. If not, you can see partially saved files by clicking Click File > Info > Manage Document > Recover Unsaved Documents.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's only for Windows, however—if you're on macOS, you're relying on the auto-recovery process. Word for both Windows and macOS lets you set how often auto-recovery files are saved: Head to File > Options > Save (Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save (macOS). The default is every 10 minutes, but you can adjust this if needed.If you're still not seeing your file, you can try checking the temporary cache folder manually. On Windows, check \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\" or \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles.\" On macOS try \"/Users//Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\"—adding in your own username where relevant.Save your work to the cloud\n    \n            \n            OneDrive gives you various extra options—including AutoSave.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThese days, Microsoft Word will tend to push you to save your work in OneDrive in the cloud. There are multiple benefits for this, including the version history feature mentioned above, and the option to collaborate on documents with other people. It also enables another handy feature: AutoSave.This is exactly what it sounds like, and means that every time something is changed in your document, it quickly syncs to the cloud. You'll see the AutoSave button in the top left hand corner enabled when it's active, and the document name at the top of the app window will indicate when saves are in progress.Should Word or your PC crash, your work should be safe. AutoSave is enabled by default for files saved to OneDrive, but you can customize this behavior by heading to File > Options > Save on Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save on macOS.\n            ",

If you have the same experience, I have good news: I've found a workaround that offers a massive improvement to Apple's built-in search function. The problem with searching in MessagesFor most people, the easiest way to search for texts on an iPhone involves opening the Messages app, tapping the search bar near the base of the screen, and typing in what you're looking for. You'll receive a variety of results, but that's the problem: It's too much information. When I search for a person's name, for example, Messages in iOS 26 shows a list of four chats where the name is mentioned, followed by two chat threads, pinned chats, shared notes, links, photos, locations, and documents. This is great when I want a more in-depth search, but when I'm just looking for a specific message, these extra details just get in the way.  \nThe fastest way to search for texts in iOS 26That's where our hack comes in. First, open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone, then install the Search and Open Messages shortcut. This shortcuts takes advantage of actions released in iOS 26, which allow you to look for text messages and open them in a single tap. Once the shortcut is installed, you can run it from the Shortcuts app, or add it to your iPhone's Home Screen for easier access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe shortcut will prompt you to type what you want to search for, and almost instantly, it'll list all the chats containing those words. In some cases, it even highlights the exact sentence containing those words. It'll find keywords in images you share, as well: These appears as \"blank\" entries in the search results, but if you tap through, you'll see the image the search identified. The moment you tap a result, the shortcut instantly takes you to the relevant part of the chat, and doesn't make you scroll through hundreds of results to find the right one. This is the kind of functionality Apple needs to add directly to Messages. But, for now, this shortcut workaround will have to do.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.In the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time. But that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility. The researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own). The participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios. How a chatbot with “correct” information can lead people astrayAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information. Even if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.  The researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:The users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that. The bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).Responses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room. People varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.Correct answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options. Overall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChatbots are a risk for doctors, tooPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care. ECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”ECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”Even in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns. Clearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results. \n            \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Beth Skwarecki\n                                    Senior Health Editor\n                                \n                                            Covering health, fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Beth's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Beth\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers more in the way of manual shooting controls, with the added benefit of an entire integrated suite of editing features.Using Snapseed's built-in camera on iPhoneOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n    \n            \n            Look out for the new camera button in Snapseed.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer. \nOnce you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n    \n            \n            You've got some classic film styles to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.Up in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Pro controls can be called up in a couple of taps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.Most filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image. The layers button (two squares) at the top gives you access to the current editing stack, and there's also an undo button to the left. When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.It's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.If you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n    \n            \n            You can mute some or all of your phone's notifications when driving.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.On both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.Other Android Auto notification settingsAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.When you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.There are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n    \n            \n            You can control how messages appear on your dashboard.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.It's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.You should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

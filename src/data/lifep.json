YouTube for Vision OS is a free, standalone app that lets users log into their existing YouTube accounts through their Vision headsets and stream videos like they would expect to, including standard videos, 180° videos, 360° videos, and YouTube Shorts. Vision Pro M5 users can stream 8K videos, and premium YouTube members can download videos directly to their headsets, a must for long flights.  Google, YouTube's parent company, has apparently been working on the app for a while. In 2024, a spokesperson confirmed that a standalone Vision Pro app was \"on our roadmap,\" but until today, the only way Vision users could watch YouTube on their headsets was through the Safari web browser. The new YouTube app is designed to fit into Vision's spatial computing environments. \"Rather than just responding to different screen sizes, we needed something that responds to different spaces, volumes and use cases,\" YouTube's senior UX designer Brendan Polley told Apple. \"We built an entirely new design system that isolated core elements—comments, the play button, 'like' and 'dislike'—to fit any layout.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHaving downloaded the app, it works exactly as intended. If you're looking for something that demonstrates Vision Pro's immersive video capabilities, you should check out the just-released 360° videos from the Milano Cortina winter Olympics on NBC's channel.

You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave. That, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes. As it happens, that intentional design is here. Apple and Google actually worked together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which makes switching between the two platforms more seamless. \nNews first broke about this partnership back in December, and, at that time, Google released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. Shortly after, Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.3, which featured the transfer tool. Now, iOS 26.3 is here, and with it, an easier way to switch from iPhone to a device made by Google, Samsung, or any other Android OEM.   How to use the new iPhone-to-Android option in iOS 26.3The feature seems easy enough to use. Once you update your iPhone to iOS 26.3, you can head to Settings > General, then scroll down to \"Transfer or Reset iPhone.\" Tap this option, then choose \"Transfer to Android.\" Here, iOS will present a pop-up, telling you to place your iPhone next to your new Android device, where you can transfer photos, messages, and apps, among other data points. (That said, health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" cannot be transferred.)You'll need to make sure both devices are running the latest updates, are connected to wifi, and have Bluetooth enabled. However, Apple also says your Android device should be in the \"setup process,\" which means you likely won't be able to use this feature if your Android phone is already set up. From here, your iPhone will ask you to scan a QR code that should appear on your Android device. Alternatively, you'll be able to tap \"Other Options\" on your iPhone to enter the Session ID and Pairing Code that should appear on your Android.    \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, you can choose the data you want to transfer, including photos, contacts, calendars, call history, and messages. Tap \"Continue\" once complete, then choose to transfer your eSIM, if applicable. (You'll need to double-click the side of your iPhone when prompted to complete the eSIM transfer.) This works in the other direction too, though Apple says you do still need to use the Move to iOS app on Android—at least until Google sets up a similar protocol on its end.  More flexibility from Apple and Google is better for everyone Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.More choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

If you often feel low on energy, one of the first things you should ask yourself is how much sleep you're getting. Good sleep also helps our overall health, our recovery from exercise, our ability to focus, and more. And while there are plenty of gadgets and biohacks that claim to help, the fundamentals of sleep hygiene are basic and simple. How to know if you need more sleepMost adults need seven to nine hours of sleep, on average, each night. This varies: you might be a seven-hour person or a nine-hour person. (Young people usually need even more; older adults may be okay with less.) So if you’re feeling tired all the time, an easy gut check is to note how much time you spend in bed, on average. If it's fewer than seven hours, it's probably not enough. And even if it's within that seven- to nine-hour window, try getting an extra hour or two of sleep for a few days in a row. If you feel a lot better, you have your answer. Wearables like smartwatches and rings can help collect data, but remember that the main thing they can tell you is how much sleep you're getting. (Sleep \"quality\" scores and even sleep stages are not necessarily reliable.) To call out a few of my favorites: the Oura ring is pricey ($349-$499) but comfortable to wear and presents data nicely. The Amazfit Helio Strap is a bargain at $99 and can track workouts, too. Garmin's Index Sleep Band ($169) is built for comfort while you sleep, but gives the same data as Garmin watches, so you may just want to find a watch you like and stick with that. If you have trouble waking up on time but easily fall asleep when you’re sitting quietly (like watching a movie), that's another sign you're probably not getting enough sleep. If you sleep in when you get the chance, your wake-up time is another hint. If you sleep in two hours or more past your normal time, that's your body applying a short-term fix (getting enough sleep now) to a long-term problem (chronically getting too little sleep). If you know you should sleep more, but you can’t seem to figure out how, below are the basics of sleep hygiene you need to master.Stick to a sleep scheduleSet a wake-up time that you can stick to every day. Consistency is important here: don’t set the alarm for 6 a.m. on weekdays and sleep until noon on weekends. If you can’t be perfectly consistent—for example, if you work different shifts—adjust as needed, but try to do your best. Next comes setting a bedtime. Figure out what time you need to hit the hay to get enough sleep before your alarm goes off. Then work backward from that to figure out when to start changing into jammies and whatever else your nighttime routine involves. (More on that routine below.)Crucial to both steps is prioritizing sleep so you can actually get yourself on schedule. If you’ve been having trouble getting enough sleep lately, give yourself a week or two to make your bedtime and wake-up time (and nine or so hours in between) the highest priority appointments in your calendar. Don’t go out too late, and don’t stay up revenge procrastinating. There will be time for occasional indulgences once your everyday schedule is more consistent. Include these four things in your bedtime routineOkay, so what goes into that routine? Feel free to personalize the specifics, but sleep experts recommend that you include the following as basic building blocks: At least 30 minutes dedicated to winding down. Don’t expect to switch off the lights and instantly be able to zonk out.No screens right before bedtime. No, not even with blue-blocking glasses. Those glasses don’t actually block very much blue light anyway. Videos and social media keep your brain awake and unrelaxed, so they don’t really have a place in your wind-down time anyway. Dim the lights. A cool, dark bedroom makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Do something relaxing. Read a chill book. Take a luxurious bath. Do some breathing exercises. Whatever works for you. Sticking to this routine not only helps you get into a relaxed mood for sleeping, it also helps you stick to that sleep schedule you set in the first step. After all, you can't be halfway through a movie at 10 p.m. if you refrained from starting it at 9 p.m.Set your body clock during the daySleep and darkness aren't the only things that set your body's circadian rhythms. Daytime activities help to keep your internal clock on track, and these can help your overall health as well.Get plenty of sunlight in the morning. (In the winter, a light box may help.) Exercise during the day. You can combine this with sunlight by going for a morning or lunchtime walk. But any type of exercise will help you to sleep better. Eat meals earlier in the day. We sleep best when we eat during the daytime; if a nice early breakfast fits your schedule, consider making it a regular thing. But at the very least, don’t eat right before bed. Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the eveningsCaffeine keeps you up, and its effects linger longer than you may realize. Caffeine has a half-life of five hours, with some of us processing it a little faster or a little slower. To put this another way, If the average person has a 250-milligram cup of coffee at noon (such as a Starbucks Tall sized brewed coffee), they'll still have about 125 milligrams in their system at 5 p.m. and 63 milligrams at 10 p.m.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe speed with which we break down caffeine varies from person to person, but in general: It’s affecting you more than you realize. If you think of yourself as a person who “can have an energy drink and then fall right to sleep” you are probably (a) in denial—hey, you’re the one who clicked on an article about getting better sleep—and/or (b) you have built up a massive caffeine tolerance because you drink so much of the stuff to stay awake, which in turn is because you don’t get enough sleep so you’re tired all the time. Do yourself a favor and break the cycle. An easy way to back off is to give yourself a cutoff time. No caffeine after 5 p.m., let’s say. Once that’s part of your routine, walk it back to 2 p.m. or noon. Alcohol is another chemical that affects our sleep. A nightcap before bed may make you feel sleepy, but it tends to disrupt the quality of your sleep. If you aren’t convinced, just start keeping a sleep diary—on paper is fine if you don’t have a sleep-tracking gadget—and see if you don’t get more and better sleep on the nights you don’t drink.Make your bedroom a dark little caveA welcoming, cozy bed will help you get to sleep faster. Make it dark, with blackout curtains or an eye mask, if needed. Make it quiet, with a white noise machine or earplugs if you can’t completely silence your surroundings. And make it a comfortable temperature. Most people prefer a cool environment—usually around 66 degrees—but again, this varies from person to person.Comfortable sheets and pillows can help. If you’re always tossing and turning, try to figure out if there’s something that physically bothers you. A new mattress might not be in the budget, but a mattress topper or a different pillow is an easy fix.ExperimentWhile the tips here are the basic things you should at least try, you may not need every single aspect to be textbook. I freeze if my room is set to 66 degrees, for example, so I keep the thermostat a tick warmer and I make sure I always have a warm duvet, even in summertime. You may find that you can bend certain rules but not others. I always have a crappy night’s sleep if I’ve been drinking, but late meals don’t bother me much. Once you’re getting a solid night’s sleep on the regular, you can start playing with the routine. And if you’re doing everything you can for good sleep hygiene and you still feel tired all the time, consider seeking medical help in case you have sleep apnea or another condition that could be affecting your sleep or energy levels.\n            \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Beth Skwarecki\n                                    Senior Health Editor\n                                \n                                            Covering health, fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Beth's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Beth\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

But despite delay after delay, rumors have strongly suggested that the next generation of Siri is set to launch with iOS 26.4. And seeing as Apple just released iOS 26.3 this week, AI Siri is closer than ever, right? Wrong.  As reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has once again kicked Siri's big updates down the road. According to Gurman, the company really did intend to release AI Siri with iOS 26.4, which is reportedly planned to release sometime in March. However, due to testing \"snags,\" the company is instead planning to break up Siri's major updates and distribute them across several iOS updates. Gurman notes that likely means iOS 26.5, which could launch in May, and iOS 27, which will likely release in September, if it follows Apple's usual release dates. But looking at Apple's track record here, don't hold your breath. AI Siri's upcoming features are a struggleAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple is struggling to get Siri to \"properly process queries,\" or to actually respond fast enough, both of which would defeat the purpose of using a smart assistant. Apple is reportedly pushing engineers to use iOS 26.5 to test these features, particularly the ability for Siri to use your personal data to answer questions. Users may be able to flip a switch in Settings to \"preview\" these features, and may treat the rollout as a beta.\nEngineers are also struggling to get Siri's app intents to work, or the feature that lets Siri take actions on your behalf. You could ask Siri to open an image, edit it, then share it with a friend, but only if the feature itself actually works. This, too, may roll out with iOS 26.5, but it's unclear due to reliability issues. Siri is also cutting off user prompts too soon, and sometimes taps into ChatGPT instead of using Apple's underlying tech—which would look pretty bad for the company.  Apple is also testing new AI features for iOS 26.5 that we haven't heard of yet. One is a new web search tool that functions like other AI search features from companies like Perplexity and Google. You ask a question to search on the web, and it returns a report with summaries and links. The other new feature is a custom image generation tool, that builds on Image Playground, but that too is hitting development hurdles. Looking even further ahead, Apple is planning more Siri advancements—namely, giving the assistant chatbot features, à la ChatGPT. (That said, it will reportedly use Gemini to power these features.) This version of Siri may even have its own app.  What's going on with AI Siri?It seems Siri really is Apple's albatross. Despite arguably popularizing smart assistants for the general population, Siri quickly fell behind compared to the likes of Alexa and Gemini (née Google Assistant). Now, the latter have fully embraced modern generative AI, offering features like contextual awareness and natural language commands. While Amazon and Google users can ask their assistants increasingly complicated questions, Siri still feels designed mostly to handle setting alarms and checking the weather. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat was going to change with iOS 18, alongside Apple Intelligence as a whole. Apple's initial pitch for AI Siri was an assistant that could see what's on your phone to better understand questions you ask, and take actions on your behalf—i.e., app intents. You could ask Siri to edit an image you have pulled up on your Photos app, and because the assistant is contextually aware, it would know what image you mean, and apply the edits you ask for. Or, you could ask when your friend was set to arrive, and the assistant would be able to scan messages and emails to know that, one, your friend is visiting town this weekend, and two, that they sent you their flight itinerary that gets them into the airport at 3:55 p.m. This Siri has never launched, however. While the company has rolled out iterative updates to Siri with some AI-powered features, its overhaul with these ambitious features have been a trial for Apple's AI team. It all stems from Apple's issues with AI in general: The company was caught off guard by the generative AI wave kicked off in late 2022 by OpenAI's ChatGPT, and following some resistance from corporate leadership, have been scrambling to keep up ever since. Apple Intelligence launched half-baked with issues of its own, but rather than launch a half-baked AI Siri, the company has been struggling to build up the assistant internally. Part of the problem is privacy-related: Unlike other tech companies, who have no problem hoovering up user data to train their models with, Apple still wants to preserve privacy while rolling out AI features. As such, that complicates their situation, as they need to ensure both the hardware and software involved meet those standards. You can't have Siri pull user data into the cloud without strict security measures if you want to ensure your users' data remains private. The company is also focused on building its own hardware for cloud-based AI processing, rather than focus on simply buying up GPUs as many other companies have. Apple is the second most valuable tech company in the world, but a host of factors—including with software, hardware, and leadership—have made it so even Apple can't magically produce an AI assistant. Though, I'm not sold that an AI Siri will move units for Apple in the first place. I can't imagine Gemini moves people to Android, and you can download ChatGPT on any device you own. It's even now built into your iPhone.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.Chat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.The problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And while you're signing up, you'll also get $30 to spend on accessories during (but not before or after) your pre-order. You can also choose to be entered in a $5,000 sweepstakes for general Samsung online store credit, if you'd like.The catch? The pre-order window doesn't seem to be open quiet yet. Usually, that happens within a week of Galaxy Unpacked airing, but you can still get the process started now. Just head to Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked reservation website, enter your name and at least an email address (you can also toss in your phone number, if you'd like), and you'll be taken to the form you need. If you want to enter the sweepstakes, also check the box saying you want to enter.\nFrom there, you can pick your current phone manufacturer and your phone model from a drop-down menu. Note that the manufacturer options include Samsung, Apple, Google, and \"Other,\" so it seems like Samsung is willing to let you trade in phones it doesn't make, too. As for the model picker, you can pick models going back around five years for each of the manufacturer options, although if you don't see your model on the list, you can also pick \"Other\" here, too.How much will Samsung give me for my phone?I can't promise how much Samsung will give you for each specific phone model, although it stands to reason that newer and higher spec phones will earn you more. I'm also willing to wager that Samsung might give you more credit if you trade in one of its own phones, but that's just speculation. To get the full $900, I'm guessing you'll need to trade in a Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce you've made your selection, hit Submit, then scroll down a bit and click what you're interested in getting offers from Samsung on. Make sure you at least select \"Trade In,\" and then click Submit here, too.And that's it for now. Samsung will now know what type of phone you have and that you're interested in a trade-in, and should email you with an appropriate trade-in offer once it's available. Again, this should happen closer to Unpacked, likely within a week of Feb 25.What will the Galaxy S26 look like?All in all, it's a good opportunity for a deal, but it does continue an unfortunate trend of Samsung's—asking you to pre-order a device before it's officially been revealed, and before you know its full specs list. Luckily, a number of rumors for the Galaxy S26 has made it easy to guess at what we're likely to see, including a similar look to the S25, no ultra thin S26 Edge model, a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and a new 10MP telephoto lens on the Ultra model. For confirmation, though, we have no choice but to wait.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The first lets users request that Google remove sensitive government ID information from Search, while the second gives users new tools to request the same for non-consensual explicit images. Google's \"Results about you\" tool is getting an update\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nFirst, Google is updating its existing \"Results about you\" tool, which helps users scour the internet for their personal information. Before today, this tool could already locate data points like your name, phone number, email addresses, and home addresses. Following the update, you can now find and request the deletion of search results containing highly sensitive information, including your driver's license, passport, or Social Security number.To launch this tool, click here. If you've never used \"Results about you\" before, you'll need to set it up to tell Google what to look out for. Once you do, you'll be able to add government ID numbers, such as your driver's license, passport, and Social Security number. If Google finds a match, the company will let you know. You can receive an alert from the Google app on your smartphone, which takes you to a summary of what data was found and where. From here, you can choose from \"Request to remove,\" or \"Mark as reviewed.\"  \nUnfortunately, this tool won't remove the data from the websites that are hosting it, but it will eventually remove the search results—sharply reducing the chance that someone will find your data on their own. Google says these changes will roll out in the U.S. over the \"coming days,\" while it is working on bringing them to other countries in the future.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's simpler way to remove explicit images from Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIn addition to these changes, Google is now rolling out a simpler tool for users to request the remove of non-consensual explicit images (NCEI) from Search. If you find such an image on Search, you can tap the three dots on that image, choose \"remove result,\" then \"it shows a sexual image of me.\" You'll have the choice to report whether the photo is real, or is artificially generated, as well, and you can report multiple images at once, if needed. Your requests will all appear in the Results about you hub, so you can track the progress of each.The tool lets you opt-in to an option that will filter additional explicit results in other searches. Google says it will also share links to \"emotional and legal support\" after you submit a request.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The app has over three billion monthly active users, constantly messaging and calling one another across the globe. However, currently those calls are all happening over the mobile app, or maybe the desktop app. Though WhatsApp does have a web app, the service has never supported audio or video calls outside of its downloadable apps—until now. You can now make calls from the WhatsApp web appAccording to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is slowly rolling out audio and video calls to its web app. At launch, the functionality is coming to individual chats with users who elect to enroll in the WhatsApp web app's beta, but the company plans to roll out the feature to all web app users over the coming weeks.WABetaInfo notes that voice and audio calls work about the same as they do in the WhatsApp desktop app. When you open an individual chat in the web app, you'll now see a video call icon at the top. Click this, and you'll find two options: one to place a voice call, and one to place a video call. These calls are still end-to-end encrypted, as they are on WhatsApp's desktop and mobile apps, meaning only the users who are a part of the calls can hear what's being said. In addition, the web app's video call client supports Screen Share, so you can share a live stream of your computer's screen to another WhatsApp contact. \nWhatsApp is also reportedly working on group chat calls for web app users, as well. While that feature won't roll out alongside individual calls, when it does launch, you'll be able to join group chats with up to 32 people. If you tend to use the WhatsApp desktop or mobile apps, this might not seem like huge news—but it is pretty substantial for a few subsets of WhatsApp users. One, of course, is the user base that just prefers using WhatsApp in their computer's web browser—but the other is Linux users. WhatsApp doesn't actually offer a version of its desktop app for Linux, so those users have to use the web app if they want to run WhatsApp on their computers. That means they've never before been able to place calls without pulling out a mobile device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sign up for the WhatsApp web app betaThis feature will soon roll out to all web app users, but until then, you need to be running the WhatsApp web app beta in order to try it.Luckily, it's pretty easy to get up and running. To start, open the web app, then head to the settings menu, choose \"Help,\" then choose the \"Join beta\" option. This will immediately switch you over to the beta version of the web app. (You should see a \"Beta\" label on your screen.) Now that you're running the beta, should you find the option to place calls in individual chats. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

(They took some work to put together, too.) Digital music sort of killed mixtapes, but, in their place, came playlists. You could easily put together a collection of your favorite songs, and either burn them to a CD, or, as streaming took over, let the playlist itself grow as large as you wanted. Anyone can make a playlist, but there's an art to it. Someone with a keen ear for music can build a playlist you can let play for hours. Maybe you have a friend who's good at making playlists, or maybe you're that friend in your group. They can be a fun way to share music, and find some new music to add to your own library. Now, generative AI wants to replace human intervention altogether. Rather than you or a friend building a playlist, you can ask AI to do it for you. And YouTube Music is the latest service to give it a try.\nYouTube announced its new AI playlist generator in a post on X on Monday. If you subscribe to either YouTube Premium or YouTube Music Premium, you can ask YouTube's AI to make a playlist based on whatever parameters you want. To try it out, open YouTube Music, then head to your Library and tap \"New.\" Next, choose the new \"AI Playlist\" option, then enter the type of music you're looking for. You could ask YouTube Music to generate a playlist of pop-punk songs, or to make something to play when focusing on work. Really, it's whatever you want, and if the AI gets it wrong, you can try it again. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nIt's pretty straightforward, and nothing revolutionary. Other music streaming services have their own AI playlist generators too. Spotify, for example, has had one for a couple of years, but recently rolled out Prompted Playlist as well, which lets you generate playlists that update with time, and takes your listening history into account. With this update, however, YouTube is likely trying to drum up some interest in its streaming service and encourage users to pay for it. Just this week, the company put lyrics—once a free feature—behind the Premium paywall. I suppose it thinks that if you can't read what your favorite artists are singing, and you'd like to have a bot make your playlists for you, you might just subscribe to its platform. This could be a good change in the long run for YouTube Music subscribers. I'm on Apple Music, so I don't really use AI-generated playlists. I like the Apple-curated playlists, as well as the ones my friends and I make and share. But who knows: Maybe human-generated playlists are going the way of the mixtape.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men. Carefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight. Men can have eating disorders, tooBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness. Unfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"Unsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent. We all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.What’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.Unattainable beauty standards stay unattainableBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation.  “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty  regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor. What does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.As a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.The bottom lineThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement? Women have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.\n            \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

That includes the discontinued LCD model, both versions of the Steam Deck OLED, and even refurbished options.The shortage was first spotted last night by deals hunter Wario64, who at the time noted that the Steam Deck was sold out in the U.S., but still available in other countries. Unfortunately, since then, both Tom's Hardware and Windows Central have reported that the handheld isn't available in some Asian countries either. There does still seems to be some hope for gamers in Europe, as Windows Central's Adam Hales said he could still see available stock in his native U.K., including the discontinued Steam Deck LCD.Valve has yet to comment on the sudden disappearance of the Steam Deck from its site, although I've reached out and will update this post if I hear back.\nWhile Valve hasn't provided an official reason for the Steam Deck shortage, an obvious culprit is the ongoing RAM crisis, which has seen the cost for consumer memory components double or even triple as AI data centers eat up the available supply. It's possible this shortage is finally affecting the Steam Deck, although that's just speculation until Valve officially confirms it.That said, the explanation would align with a post Valve made to its blog last week, in which the company said its upcoming Steam Machine and Steam Frame hardware are being impacted by \"memory and storage shortages.\" While the company didn't outright announce a delay for these devices, saying it still plans to ship them \"in the first half of the year,\" it also noted \"we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing.\"It's possible the situation with \"limited availability and growing prices of these critical components,\" as Valve put it it that post, is now affecting the Steam Deck too, though there are other possible explanations. The simplest, and most hopeful, is that this is simply a minor hiccup in availability, and it will be corrected by the end of the week. Alternatively, it's possible the shortage could be related to tariffs, as while whole smartphones and computers are exempt from increased tariffs, it's unclear whether that applies to gaming devices, or to any individual components Valve might purchase to construct new Steam Decks.At any rate, we can't know for sure until we hear back from the Half-Life company itself. Perhaps slim pickings or higher prices are in the Steam Deck's future, but there's no way to know right now.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat to buy instead during the Steam Deck shortageWhile we don't yet know how long the Steam Deck will stay sold out, it might be worth looking into getting a different handheld gaming PC if the situation drags on. While you can buy Steam Decks from unofficial sellers, I wouldn't advise it, as these would all be from the secondhand market. Most come with heavily marked up prices, and it's impossible to know what kind of condition your device will be in when it arrives. A more trustworthy alternative could be GameStop, as the retailer does sell its own certified refurbished Steam Decks, which are cleaned up in a separate process from Valve's. Unfortunately, these are also out of stock at the moment.Instead, I would suggest looking at alternatives like the Lenovo Legion Go S, which starts at $600, is slightly more powerful than the Steam Deck, has a higher resolution screen, and in an official partnership with Valve, comes equipped with the same operating system as the Steam Deck. (I actually prefer the Legion Go S to the Steam Deck myself.)If you've got cash to burn, you could look at a premium upgrade. The obvious ones here are the Lenovo Legion Go 2, which ups the power and packs a gorgeous OLED screen; and the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X, which may be more welcoming to console gamers. (That said, the Xbox handheld's software wasn't quite there  yet, at least when I reviewed it).Whatever your choice, you have no shortage of options for PC gaming handhelds to keep you occupied while you wait for the Steam Deck to come back in stock. Gamers will always find a way to play.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Getting a little bit of extra juice into your phone before you leave your house in the morning could make the difference between the device still having power at the end of the day or not. But there are multiple factors that affect charging rate, and you might not be aware of all of them.Run through the tips here, however, and you can be sure your phone is always charging up as quickly as possible. Use a wired power source To begin with, you're going to get your phone charged a lot faster if you plug it directly into a power source rather than putting it on a wireless charger. Wireless charging offers a lot of convenience, and is gradually getting faster and faster as far as charging rates go, but wired charging is still a long way ahead.\nTake the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, for example: You get a maximum charging rate of 45W with a wired connection, and 15W with a wireless connection over Qi2. That means the handset is going to take around three times longer to charge its battery via wireless charging. The figures for other handsets are similar.\n    \n            \n            Wireless charging: convenient but not that fast.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nNot only is wireless charging slower, it's typically less efficient as well, with more of the power being supplied to the phone lost as heat (due to the way the electricity is converted to a magnetic field and back again). With a cable and a plug, charging is faster, and it's healthier for your battery as well. Wired is the way to go if at all possible, and what you plug your phone into makes a difference as well. Wall sockets are very good for charging rates, while anything else is less good—options like laptop USB ports, USB hubs, and sockets you might find on other gadgets such as monitors won't supply as much power.Use the right cable and charger A lot of phones don't come with a charger and cable in the box these days, but they will have a fast-charging standard and a max charging rate associated with them if you check the specs. You then need to find a charger that matches that charging rate, together with a cable that's not going to slow anything down.If you look at the iPhone chargers made by Apple and on sale from its store, there are 20W, 35W, and 60W options—and the latter is going to juice up your handset the fastest. You should also look out for a mention of USB Power Delivery (PD), though this is included on pretty much every charger you'll find at this stage.\n    \n            \n            Not all charging blocks are created equal.\n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nWe've written in-depth before about USB-C cables and charging blocks, and these will again list a charging rate along with them (or at least they should). You need to make sure every link in the chain is delivering power at the maximum rate your phone can handle if you want to fully recharge as quickly as possible.You can use cables and chargers you have lying around for laptops, tablets, and other gadgets with your phone safely enough—the handset will have built-in safety features to prevent it from drawing too much power—but for the best results you'll generally want to stick with what comes in the box or the officially approved option.Don't use your phone while it's charging There are a few other tricks you can try if you want to max out charging speed. Think about the amount of power your smartphone is using while it's actually being charged: If you're constantly scrolling through social media feeds, watching videos, and playing games, then you're using precious battery life while recharging.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you can, put your phone down and leave it alone while it's charging—you might want to turn off the always-on display to help things a little bit more. For even better results, put your phone into airplane or low power mode, or turn it off entirely while it's charging (those notifications can wait).\n    \n            \n            Airplane mode can help charging speeds along.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWatch your phone's temperature Due to battery chemistry and the safeguards built into modern handsets, charging speeds slow down if your phone gets too hot or too cold. Keep your phone away from sunny window ledges or freezing bathrooms while it's being charged to maximize charging speed.It's a good idea to remove any case around your phone while you're charging it, to reduce the chances of the battery temperature rising an extra notch, and it's also worth checking the USB-C charging port on your phone to make sure it's dust- and lint-free—even a slightly imperfect connection can affect charging speeds.Monitor charging speedHowever you're charging your phone, both Android and iOS let you keep an eye on how fast the battery is being replenished. If you've got a Pixel or Galaxy phone, keep an eye on the charging message at the bottom of the lock screen: This tells you how quickly your phone is being charged, and how long it will be until you reach a full charge.For most Android devices, you can get more information by opening up the Battery page in Settings, though the details you get here will differ among devices: You should see whether or not fast charging is enabled, and maybe an estimate for how long a full recharge will take, but you won't typically get an actual wattage reading.\n    \n            \n            The charging notification on a Pixel.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWith iPhones, you can visit Battery in Settings to get information about how the battery recharge is going. While there's not a whole lot of information here, you can get an estimate of how long a charge will take, and you will see a \"slow charger\" message if your iPhone can support a charging rate faster than that offered by the connected charger.There are several Android apps that measure charging rate. Ampere is one of the best: It's free, with extra features (such as widgets and notifications) available for a fee. Note that you need to multiply current x voltage then divide by 1,000 to get the wattage. There isn't really anything comparable on iOS, unfortunately—what few apps there are appear to be out of date and/or unreliable.\n            ",

The carrier announced today that it will soon introduce live translation to all phones connected to its 5G or 4G networks, and to get in on the action, you're going to want to sign up for the beta now.According to a press release sent to journalists today, the new feature will kick in for you automatically once you're selected for it, no matter what phone app or device you use. All you'll need to do to access it is type in \"87\" on the keypad during a phone call. Which means that, yes, it will also be compatible with feature phones, aka classic-style flip phones with physical buttons. The device you use doesn't matter because all of the computing for the translation will happen on T-Mobile's end, rather than on your device. The downside is that you won't get to pick which AI model the translation uses, and T-Mobile hasn't yet to provide any indication of which one it will use. You'll also just have to trust T-Mobile's servers with any audio recorded from your conversation. T-Mobile spokesperson Mason Miller told Lifehacker's sister site PCMag via email that, \"[T-Mobile does] not save call recordings or transcripts,\" but the company will certainly ave to run your data through its servers at some point to make the feature work. By comparison, competing translation apps often rely on downloaded language packs and on-device models.\nStill, I see where T-Mobile is coming from with this offering: When live translation is limited to specific devices or apps, it vastly impacts its usability, since both callers need to have a compatible device for it to work. Processing translation over the cloud makes it more likely you'll be able to use it exactly when you need it—and as a bonus, only one caller will actually need to be on T-Mobile's 5G or 4G network to pull this trick off.While T-Mobile's press release focuses on 5G, the carrier confirmed availability for the feature on 4G to The Verge earlier today. The Verge also reports that, in addition to dialing 87, beta participants will eventually be able to trigger live translation by saying \"Hey T-Mobile\" instead.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen T-Mobile live translations will go liveTesting for T-Mobile's live translation will begin \"for selected users\" this spring, with more general availability planned for \"later this year.\" The feature will be free during the beta, although a surcharge might be added after it goes into wide release. \"We will share more on pricing and plan details closer to commercial launch,\" Miller told PCMag.To sign up for the beta and put your hat in the ring for selection, head over to t-mobile.com/benefits/live-translation.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>On Tuesday, Apple dropped <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-releases-first-ios-26-1-beta-with-some-subtle-iphone-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the first beta for iOS 26.1</a>. With it, we can see what the company is planning for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">the successor to iOS 26</a>, including new gestures in Apple Music, a new scrubbing bar for the video player, and Liquid Glass support for the keypad in the Phone app. It's a small update on the surface, but there's something quite interesting going on behind the scenes. </p><h2 id=\"notification-forwarding\">'Notification Forwarding'</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by Macworld</a>, code within the iOS 26.1 beta suggests that Apple is working on support for third-party smartwatches in future versions of iOS. Macworld found references to a new feature called \"Notification Forwarding,\" which supposedly would allows users to direct alerts from their iPhone to a device not made by Apple. It's a bit vague, as that could mean anything from a tablet to a PC, but Macworld believes it is intended to support notification forwarding to non-Apple smartwatches.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The code also seems to indicate that this feature supports notification forwarding to one device at a time. If you were to set your notifications from your iPhone to a Galaxy Watch, for example, it might disable notifications to your Apple Watch. In addition, there are references to an unfinished feature called \"AccessoryExtension,\" which might support pairing third-party watches to your iPhone. </p><p>Notification Forwarding and AccessoryExtension could be indicative of a big change for Apple. One of the things that makes the company so successful is its \"ecosystem,\" the idea that Apple's products are designed to work seamlessly together. If you have an iPhone, it connects to and works with iPads, Macs, and, of course, Apple Watches. When you try to connect to and work with third-party devices, however, you run into road blocks. </p><p>Smartwatches might be among the biggest hurdles here. Apple's smartwatch, of course, does everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do with your smartphone. But if you're thinking of picking up a Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch, it's a different story. In fact, there's really no way to pair one of these to your iPhone. If you're coming from Android and you try to use your Pixel Watch with your iPhone, you're going to have a bad time. \"Notification Forwarding\" could offer a bridge.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Some smartwatches, like those from Garmin, do offer notification forwarding support already, so the feature wouldn't necessarily be groundbreaking. But it could expand smartwatch options for users beyond the limited devices that currently work with iOS' notifications. </p><h2 id=\"two-reasons-you-might-not-see-these-changes-on-your-iphone\">Two reasons you might not see these changes on your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get too excited, there are a couple of caveats here. First, these changes are not an active part of iOS 26.1; rather, they are simply references within the code. That indicates this is something Apple is working on, but not necessarily something that will definitely launch. Until we see the features appear in a future beta update, it's possible this will simply remain an experiment. </p><p>And even if Apple does roll out these changes, it might only be to a select group of users. There's a chance third-party smartwatch support is solely targeted towards the EU, following the union's <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-dma-eu-connectivity-interoperability-proceedings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Digital Markets Act</a>. That legislation requires Apple to open up iOS to third-party devices, which, notably, includes smartwatches. Apple doesn't tend to open up when it doesn't have to, which is why the EU has third-party app stores on iOS and the rest of the world does not. We could see yet another EU-specific feature in this case: Europeans might be able to use their Android watches with iOS, while the rest of us are stuck with Apple Watches. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

But there’s good reason to believe taking notes by hand helps your brain retain more. Here’s why you should try leaving the laptop behind at home and how to make the switch to the old-school way easier.</p><h2 id=\"digital-note-taking-isnt-perfect\">Digital note-taking isn’t perfect</h2><p>There’s been plenty of research that has suggested hand-taken notes are superior to those you take on a computer, even though typing is so much faster and you can get more information on the page. Actually, that’s part of the problem: When taking notes by hand, you have to be choosy about what is important enough to write down. You have to use critical thinking, make outlines, and listen closely to determine what parts of the lecture are valuable enough to take the time to jot down. When you’re typing, you can just transcribe the whole lecture in real time if you want—and you might go on autopilot to do so without engaging your brain deeply in the material. </p>\n<p>I made this mistake in grad school: I'd type everything the professor said, so focused on getting every word that I didn't actually <em>hear</em> the lesson. Worse, I ended up what amounted to transcripts—and the majority of what the professors would say during three-hour classes wasn't relevant to my concrete learning goals. I'd end up feeding my messy \"notes\" <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">into AI tools</a> and asking for summaries. I could have just listened more thoughtfully and intentionally the first time around.</p><p>Recent research backing up note-taking as the reigning champ was <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0098628320979895\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">published in <em>Teaching of Psychology</em></a> in 2022. Researchers put participants in four categories: those who took notes by hand and took a test on the computer, those who took notes on the computer and took a test by hand, those who took notes and did a test on the computer, and those who did it all by hand. Overall, regardless of how they ultimately took the test, the students who took notes by hand performed better on the quiz overall—and better on conceptual questions. </p><h2 id=\"your-computer-is-distracting\">Your computer is distracting</h2><p>It’s convenient to be able to look up concepts, jot down notes, and maintain tabs of supplemental materials throughout class, but it’s just as convenient to toggle over to a new window and scroll social media or send work emails. Being distracted in class is not helpful for your retention and performance, regardless of whether the tool at hand <em>could </em>help you if you were using it to.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/cjsotl_rcacea/article/view/8002\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2012 survey</a> published in the <em>Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching</em> and Learning showed that of 478 students and 36 instructors surveyed at one university, almost half found the use of technology in class for noneducational purposes distracting. There have been a <em>bunch</em> of other studies showing that use of phones or laptops for noneducational purposes during class has a negative effect on academic performance. It's why we're seeing so many jurisdictions around the country push for<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/school-phone-ban-survey\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"> phone-free school zones for kids</a>. The journal articles on these results have pretty straightforward titles like “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046?journalCode=cedp20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dividing Attention in the Classroom Reduces Exam Performance</a>” and make it clear that doing anything but taking notes or following along with class materials on the computer is only impacting your ability to obtain and retain valuable information. </p><p>And since taking notes on the computer isn’t all that great to begin with, you might as well not bring the device at all. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"plan-your-note-taking\">Plan your note-taking </h2><p>If you've been typing your notes out for years, it will be a major adjustment to go back to the old notebook and pencil. How is your handwriting looking these days? Do you even know? Time to reacquaint yourself, but in the process, you'll need a strategy as you embark on this plan.</p><p>There is actually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">quite a variety of note-taking methods; </a>the best one for you will depend on what type of content you're studying and what kind of learner you are. I linked my guide to all the approaches above. You might find outlining, the Cornell technique, or \"mapping\" or \"charting\" to work best, but you'll have to play around with them a while to figure it out. </p><p>By the way, just because you take the notes by hand doesn't mean they have to stay hand-written. You can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868\" target=\"_blank\">digitize your notes</a> using an app or even invest in a smart notebook that will do it for you as you write. I've used <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7Mn0V?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook&short_url=z7Mn0V&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fdont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class&event_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a Rocketbook smart notebook</a> in the past and found it intuitive and a nice way to straddle the analog and digital worlds. </p><p>Finally, make sure you <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">revise your notes before you leave class</a>, whenever possible. Going through them while the lecture is still fresh in your mind is crucial. You can either start digitizing them then, maybe by <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">using an app to make a mind map</a>, or just rewrite them on a different notebook page. </p>\n            </article>"

Now, with iOS 26, Apple and Beats are introducing some new fitness features that make these headphones work better as heart rate sensors. They also apply to the new  <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/airpods-pro-3-are-more-forgiving-for-the-tine-eared\" target=\"_blank\"><u>AirPods Pro 3</u></a>, which also measure heart rate. I tested the new features, and found that the experience is much improved—but still has serious problems. </p><h2 id=\"the-heart-rate-feature-now-works-on-iphones-without-third-party-apps\">The heart rate feature now works on iPhones without third-party apps</h2><p>This is the biggest improvement, and it’s unquestionably a good thing. In iOS 26, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Apple has turned the Fitness app</u></a> into a real workout-tracking app, not just a viewer for Apple Watch data. And it can pull heart rate data from Powerbeats or AirPods with heart rate sensors.</p><p>Just tap the Workout tab, check the heart rate icon in the upper right corner to make sure your Powerbeats are paired, and hit the start button on the activity you want to do. It’s easy and simple—as it should have been in the first place. </p><p>Previously, iPhones could only read heart rate data from the Powerbeats Pro 2 through certain third-party apps. These apps included a few popular premium and specialty apps, like Runna and Peloton, but there was no basic option. Now, with the updates to the Fitness app, you can log a workout that is <em>just</em> a native Apple workout, without having to create an account on a new app. </p><p>None of this was ever an issue for Android users, by the way: They were always able to pair the Powerbeats Pro 2 as a Bluetooth heart rate sensor the way you would a chest strap, and can still do that. Unfortunately, iPhone users still don’t have that kind of freedom. Only <em>some</em> apps are supported—16 of them so far, which are listed <a href=\"https://www.beatsbydre.com/heart-rate-monitoring\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>here</u></a>—but at least the main Fitness app is one of them.</p><h2 id=\"you-can-now-use-a-single-earbud-sort-of\">You can now use a single earbud (sort of)</h2><p>At first, the Powerbeats Pro 2 could only read your heart rate if you had both earbuds in. With the changes in iOS 26, you can now get heart rate readings with just a single earbud. I tried this out, with mixed results. </p><p>On the bright side, it’s true—the Fitness app gives me heart rate data even with only one earbud in. But the downside is that accuracy is diminished. The earbuds already have an accuracy issue, as I’ll discuss below, so they lose data points when the fit isn’t perfect. Remove one earbud, and you’re taking away half your data. </p><p>This is good news for people who get a good fit and good accuracy; they can choose between one and two earbuds and get a heart rate reading either way. But for those of us who can’t get a good enough fit to get good data (like me), this just gives us <em>worse</em> data.</p><h2 id=\"the-algorithm-is-better-but-maybe-not-good-enough\">The algorithm is better, but maybe not good enough</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758728900.png\" alt=\"Graph of heart rate with both earbuds (ok) and one earbud (terrible)\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758728900.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758728900.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758728900.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Powerbeats Pro 2 in orange; chest strap (for reference) in black,</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Apple has said that its new heart-rate-sensing algorithm is able to sample data points faster, which should help accuracy. It can also combine data from the headphones and from your Apple Watch, rather than choosing one or the other. (Previously, if you were wearing your Apple Watch, heart rate data from your earbuds would be ignored). </p><p>I took the earbuds for a few test runs (without the Apple Watch) to try the new algorithm. I do think the accuracy is a little bit improved! It’s still not great, but as long as I had both earbuds in, I can at least see the similarity between my chest strap data and what I was getting from the Powerbeats. </p><p>It still tended to read high for me, though—often riding above the peaks of my intervals and never dropping down very far. This isn’t good enough to follow <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate zone training</u></a> very closely, and would likely skew heart-rate-based metrics such as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/tested-vo2max-compared-to-fitness-wearables\" target=\"_blank\"><u>estimated VO2max</u></a>. But it does seem to be an improvement. </p><p>My single-earbud readings were awful, though, as you can see. To Apple’s credit, I did get a poor fit notification after both the runs that produced the graphs above.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"new-fit-notification\">New fit notification </h2><p>A new feature in iOS 26 is that you’ll get a notification to check the fit of your earbuds if the data seemed to be poor. That’s a helpful feature, because otherwise you wouldn’t know whether you’re getting good data or not. (<em>I</em> sit down at my computer and compare new devices to chest strap data, but it’s not fair to expect everyone to do that.) </p><p>Based on my experience, the Powerbeats’ issue with heart rate accuracy seems to be tied to the way they fit in your ears. The optical heart rate sensor is built into the hard plastic component, and it needs to be in close contact with your skin to be able to detect your pulse. </p><p>The earbuds come with different silicone tips to adjust the fit, and an “ear tip fit test” you can do in Settings to ensure that you get a good seal between your tip and your ears. If you get the notification telling you to check your fit, it directs you to this test and its associated advice about getting a good fit. </p><p>But there’s still a big problem here. Apple assumes that a good fit for sound is the same as a good fit for heart rate. That’s not always the case, as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/powerbeats-pro-2-track-your-heart-rate-from-your-ears-but-not-very-well\" target=\"_blank\"><u>my own testing</u></a> showed. When I passed the fit test, I got terrible heart rate data. If I turned the earbuds backward so the ear hooks were vertical, I got good heart rate data but terrible sound quality—and failed the fit test.</p><p>So these notifications can tell you that you have a problem, but they can’t <em>solve</em> your problem. I suspect it’s not really solvable. The plastic component only comes in one size, and if your ears are a different size or shape than what it was designed for, there’s no way to put the sensor in closer contact with your ears. </p><h2 id=\"iphone-users-still-cant-play-music-while-broadcasting-heart-rate-to-gym-equipment\">iPhone users still can’t play music while broadcasting heart rate to gym equipment </h2><p>I almost feel embarrassed for Apple on this one. The Powerbeats Pro 2 can broadcast your heart rate data to gym equipment, but <em>not while playing music</em>. This still feels half-baked and I hope Apple is working on a fix for this. For now, here’s what you can expect: </p><ul><li><p>Android users can play music from their phone while broadcasting to gym equipment.</p></li><li><p>Gym equipment that plays sound over bluetooth can play to your Powerbeats while you broadcast heart rate to that same gym equipment.</p></li><li><p>iPhone users cannot play music from their iPhone while broadcasting to gym equipment. </p></li></ul><p>Overall, I'm pleased to see the changes Apple has made to improve the usefulness and accuracy of the Powerbeats Pro 2's heart rate monitoring feature, but I'm still disappointed in some of the ways it fails to live up to its promises. These are expensive headphones to buy without knowing whether they'll fit your ears well enough to get reliable heart rate data. The missing music when broadcasting to gym equipment is especially disappointing. But the fit notifications are a great addition so that at least people know when they're having accuracy issues, and I appreciate the more accurate data sampling—even if the result isn't perfect.</p>\n            </article>"

/><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-announces-new-fleet-of-equipment-and-ai-coaching\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton announced this week, among other things</a>, that all of its devices are getting a bit of an overhaul. While the Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and Row each got some improvements, this doesn't necessarily mean you have to upgrade your equipment just yet.</p><h2 id=\"comparing-old-peloton-models-with-the-new-cross-training-series\">Comparing old Peloton models with the new Cross Training Series</h2><p>First, the basics: Peloton unveiled all-new versions of its classic at-home fitness equipment Wednesday. Collectively, they're known as the Cross Training series—the equipment itself is the Cross Training Bike, the Cross Training Bike+, etc. Like before, there are still five models—two bikes, two treadmills, and a rowing machine—but the new versions have features that make them more compatible with cross training and are just a little better than their predecessors overall. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h3>Peloton Bike vs. Peloton Cross Training Bike</h3><p>We'll start with the classic bike, Peloton's bread and butter. The original Bike retails for $1,145 and the new <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aRMGq1?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cross%20Training%20Bike%20is%20%241%2C695&short_url=aRMGq1&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row&event_label=Cross%20Training%20Bike%20is%20%241%2C695\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cross Training Bike is $1,695</a>. Like all the new models, the updated version of the base model Bike features a swiveling touchscreen designed to make it easier for you to segue from cardio on the machine to strength, stretching, yoga, or some other Peloton workout, all while still following along with an instructor on the screen. </p><p>Otherwise, what this $200 price hike gets you is pretty basic: There is improved audio in the form of front-facing speakers, better wifi connectivity, and Bluetooth 5.2. It also has an upgraded seat, which Peloton describes as \"an ergonomically redesigned saddle with enhanced cushioning and optimized weight distribution.\" A comfier seat is a bonus, but comfier seats were already <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-peloton-bike-accessories\" target=\"_blank\">available on the third-party market</a>. </p><p>There are more similarities between the old model and new than there are differences. Both have manual resistance knobs, a 21.5\" touchscreen, a belt drive, and magnetic resistance. To be clear, Peloton didn't set out to reinvent the (fly)wheel here; all of these devices are functionally similar to their predecessors. You cycle on the Bike, run on the Tread, and row on the Row, just as you always did. </p><h3>Bike+ vs. Cross Training Bike+</h3><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-plus-review\" target=\"_blank\">I liked the old Bike+</a> when I tested it out, but the new Bike+ has some significant upgrades over that one. The old-style Bike+ retails for $2,495 while the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWERgN?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cross%20Training%20Bike%2B%20is%20%242%2C695&short_url=QWERgN&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row&event_label=Cross%20Training%20Bike%2B%20is%20%242%2C695\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cross Training Bike+ is $2,695</a>. You get the swivel screen and the upgraded seat, but you also get a movement-tracking camera that uses AI to make suggestions and correct your form, Sonos audio with a woofer, AI-powered voice commands, a fan, a phone tray, and better software overall. Like the old Bike+, this one has a 23.8\" HD touchscreen and the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-plus-auto-resistance\" target=\"_blank\">much-loved auto-resistance feature</a>.</p><p>I got the chance to play around with the new devices at Peloton Studios this week and, from what I experienced, the company's claims that the hardware and software have been enhanced to improve touchscreen responsiveness and audio quality are accurate. That's true for this new Bike+ and all the newer models announced. </p><h3>Tread vs. Cross Training Tread</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDrJ2R?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cross%20Training%20Tread%20is%20%243%2C295&short_url=aDrJ2R&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row&event_label=Cross%20Training%20Tread%20is%20%243%2C295\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cross Training Tread is $3,295</a> compared to the Tread's $2,995, though both get you a 23.8\" HD touchscreen, a maximum speed of 12.5 miles per hour, and an incline up to 12.5%, as well as a soft-touch running belt. That price increase also covers the swivel screen, an upgraded processor, and better speakers and connectivity. </p><h3>Tread+ vs. Cross Training Tread+</h3><p>You're going to notice a theme here: The Plus models pack more upgraded features into their upgrades, period. That's true for the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aBDq7J?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cross%20Training%20Tread%2B&short_url=aBDq7J&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row&event_label=Cross%20Training%20Tread%2B\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cross Training Tread+</a>, which sees one of the biggest price increases over its predecessor—it now retails for $6,495 compared to $5,995. The similarities are in the 32\" screen, slatted running belt, and incline up to 15%. The differences mirror the differences between the Bike+ and Cross Training Bike+: It comes with the movement-tracking camera, swivel screen, Sonos speakers, voice control, fan, and upgraded tech and hardware. </p><h3>Row vs. Cross Training Row+</h3><p>The Row is the Peloton device that moved from plain-old equipment to Plus line. Now, the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zEJXnJ?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cross%20Training%20Row%2B&short_url=zEJXnJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row&event_label=Cross%20Training%20Row%2B\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cross Training Row+</a> retails for $3,495 instead of $3,195 and comes with all those Plus features, like the rotating screen, movement-tracking camera, Sonos speakers, voice control, fan, and upgraded processor. </p><h2 id=\"should-you-upgrade-your-peloton-device\">Should you upgrade your Peloton device?</h2><p>Let me start by saying I have only gotten to interact with the new devices for a brief time during a press event, so I haven't formed my opinion based on any extensive use. That said, what I saw at the event was impressive—especially from the Plus line, which is the line that features the much-touted movement-tracking camera. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>If you are considering upgrading, your best bet is to go all the way to Plus so you can make the most of all the new features Peloton announced. The movement-tracking camera and voice controls were really slick in the demos I participated in. The camera can correct your form or let you know when lifting a certain way is becoming too easy for you and you should consider moving to a higher weight, for instance. The Plus line also has the built-in fan, which is simply a nice touch. </p><p>All of that said, while Peloton rolled out new classes and AI features to accompany these cross training devices, everything except the motion-tracking and voice control works fine on existing equipment. If you have a Bike or even older Bike+, you'll still be able to use the new customized workout scheduling feature, plus all the other features you've already had access to. If you're not in a rush to get rid of your old machine, you don't have to unless you really want the motion-tracking camera and voice commands. </p><p>Upgrading to the Cross Training Bike or Cross Training Tread doesn't make sense to me right now, since the only real improvement you get with those is the swivel screen. If I were going to get a new device—and, after almost five years with my beloved Bike, I'm finally considering it—I'd opt for a Plus so I could take advantage of all the new tools and features. </p><p>It's worth keeping in mind, though, that whether you upgrade hardware or not, you're going to be paying more as it is. Membership fees for Peloton's app, which allows you to take classes and follow programs on your phone as well as on the company's proprietary devices, are going up as of the new equipment release. The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QmOl8K?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=new%20prices%20for%20membership%20are&short_url=QmOl8K&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row&event_label=new%20prices%20for%20membership%20are\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>new prices for membership are</u></a>:</p><ul><li><p>All-Access Membership goes up from $44 to $49.99 per month</p></li><li><p>App+ Membership goes up from $24 to $28.99</p></li><li><p>App One Membership goes up from $12.99 to $15.99</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, Peloton has done away with free installation, which we knew was coming. You'll have to spend $150 for assembly of your new device, unless you get a Cross Training Tread+, which will run you $299 in assembly fees. Accounting for all these extra fees is part of deciding if you need new equipment, so take it all in. </p><p>Peloton will be rolling out deals for existing members who want to upgrade in the coming days and weeks. For now, don't forget that the company <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-launches-resale-platform\" target=\"_blank\">launched its own resale platform</a> earlier this year and, depending on what kind of device you sell, not only do you get paid for the equipment itself, but you get a few hundred bucks off your future Peloton purchase. If you're considering a new device from this upgraded fleet, look into selling your old goods first so you have a better sense of how much money you have to work with. </p><p>And if you don't have a Peloton device but want one, maybe think about waiting around a few weeks for all the older models to hit the resale site. Like I said, the new software upgrades work just fine on them, so this could be your moment to get a great deal. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/seven-changes-that-helped-me-stick-to-my-home-fitness-routine\" target=\"_blank\">ever-expanding quest to get better at working out</a> at home. I wanted to put it into action right away, so naturally, I turned to my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Peloton app</a>, where I figured I'd load up a Pilates workout and get to work. Weirdly, though, that wasn't as easy as it is when I, say, want to follow along with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a> class. Eventually, I figured it out and the Pilates workout (which did incorporate my hoop, thank you very much) was great—and challenging, which is how I like it.</p><h2 id=\"where-to-locate-pilates-classes-on-the-peloton-app\">Where to locate Pilates classes on the Peloton app</h2><p>I knew Peloton had Pilates classes. But when I opened up the app, there was no designated Pilates button the way there are buttons for <strong>Meditation</strong> and <strong>Cycling</strong>. I typed \"Pilates\" into the search bar at the top of the mobile app and it brought up 95 class results, some of which were actually categorized as yoga and others which were listed under strength. </p><p>So, there <em>are</em> Pilates classes, but they're listed on different landing pages. Across the top of the search results page, you see <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Programs</strong>, and <strong>Music Artists</strong>. Tapping <strong>Collections</strong> yields a landing page called \"Pilates with Equipment,\" which has subcategories: Pilates with a Ball, Pilates with Sliders, Pilates with a Band, and—crucially, for me—Pilates with a Ring. There are only a handful of classes in each and they're all technically filed as \"strength classes\" in Peloton's system. I selected \"15 min Pilates\" from the section that incorporates the magic circle. </p><p>Things got harder from there. I wanted to play the class on my TV, which is possible because Peloton has an app on the Roku, but there is no search function on the Roku app. Instead, you have to look through the categories to find a class—which I couldn't do, since there is no Pilates category. I ended up getting the one I wanted by adding it to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">my Peloton Stack</a>, which is like a personal class playlist; deleting everything else from the Stack; and running the Stack on the Roku app. It wasn't efficient or ideal, but ultimately, it worked. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-pelotons-pilates-classes-are-like\">What Peloton's Pilates classes are like </h2><p>As much trouble as I had actually finding a class, I hadn't even technically done the \"hard\" part yet. Pilates is supposed to be challenging, after all, and the intermediate-level class I took definitely was. Armed with my mat and my hoop I followed along with some standard moves, like \"hundreds\" and clam shells. It was difficult, but not impossible, which is exactly what I was looking for. </p><p>Again, there are only 95 of these types of classes available and some are more about stretching while others are more strength-focused. That's a small selection compared to how many other types of classes Peloton offers. But what <em>is</em> available is solid. The instruction is clear and precise, modifications are offered, and the audio/video quality is top-tier, making it easy to hear and see what you're supposed to be doing. </p><p>I did the Peloton class last night and took an in-studio reformer class this morning. Granted, my in-person class was four times longer than the one I did from Peloton, but I'd say that adjusted for time, they were both equal in challenge. Because I am now the proud owner of a hoop <em>and </em>the knowledge of how to find high-quality, expert-led Pilates classes to play through Peloton, I'll certainly be doing more of these. Here's hoping we get a dedicated Pilates page on the Peloton app soon.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

As of Monday, iOS 26.1 is officially in beta testing, which means developers and public testers can try out Apple's next update early. </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

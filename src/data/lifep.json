    "body": "\n        \n        The security of a popular wifi router brand is under scrutiny from multiple federal agencies, and devices could be pulled from shelves in the United States in the future. According to reporting from the Washington Post, the US Department of Commerce has proposed a ban on routers from TP-Link Systems, a move that has now received support from Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Defense. What is the issue with TP-Link?The proposal reportedly stems from security concerns with routers sold by TP-Link Systems, which is in California but was spun off from the Chinese-based TP-Link Technologies. Commerce officials have warned that the devices handle sensitive data and may be subject to influence by the Chinese government. For example, there is concern that TP-Link is required to provide information to Chinese intelligence agencies and central government, which could in turn force software updates that compromise user data. (It is important to note that U.S.-based TP-Link Systems disputes this and says that only U.S. engineers can push patches to devices owned by U.S. customers.)\nThe interagency review of TP-Link actually began during the Biden administration—and this isn't the first action the federal government has taken against tech companies that have foreign ties. In June 2024, the Commerce Department banned sales of antivirus software from Russia's Kaspersky Lab to U.S. consumers.  Is my TP-Link router affected?Again, the proposal under consideration could ban future sales of TP-Link Systems routers to U.S. users. Existing devices from TP-Link have been targeted by threat actors and been subject to zero-day vulnerabilities, including a flaw that allowed full takeover. Of course, most internet-connected devices are vulnerable to hackers, and while some security experts express caution when it comes to TP-Link, there isn't unilateral support for tossing your router ASAP. Instead, you should continue to follow security best practices to protect your home network, such as changing default login credentials, enabling protective features like a firewall and encryption, and keeping your device's firmware up to date. If you do need to purchase a new router—if you stop renting from your internet service provider, for example—you might consider a different brand. Some estimates suggest that TP-Link's home routers make up as much as half of the market in the U.S. (though others put the numbers much lower). Many of those devices are sold or leased through ISPs. \n            ",

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.Researchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

A few methods that originated in Japan have proven especially popular—consider the Toyota-approved Kanban scheduling method—including one of my favorites: kaizen. The man who took the philosophy mainstream, Masaaki Imai, died two years ago, but left behind a legacy of productivity and efficiency we can all learn from, because this technique not only helps you get more done, but helps you do everything better. What is kaizen?In Japanese, “kaizen” translates, essentially, to “improvement,” and that’s the goal at the heart of the method itself, which encourages individuals at all levels of an organization to work together to continuously improve everything about a company. When everyone from the boss to the intern is in on the plan, the idea goes, the place will simply be more efficient and everything will always be getting better. This is done through standardization and the implementation of uniform processes.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nA good example of this is within the Toyota production system: If there is any issue or abnormality detected by any worker in a factory, they stop the production line and employees and supervisors work together to resolve the problem. As Toyota puts it, this “humanizes the workplace” and the standardization involved empowers every individual in the organizational structure to make meaningful changes. This is all part of a system called Plan, Do, Check, Act (usually known as PDCA), which works perfectly within a kaizen framework. The PDCA cycle repeats, meaning once you’ve planned, you keep doing, checking, acting, and planning again, factoring in your results, so you’re always improving. (If you're familiar with an after-action review, which calls on you to review what you did poorly and what you did well, then use that information to plan out how you'll improve in the future, that's a helpful framework for understanding PDCA.) And while you’re doing all that, you have to keep the kaizen principles themselves in mind. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow does kaizen work?In addition to incorporating PDCA, kaizen has its own set of five foundational principles:Know your customer: Cater to your customers or clients and take care to identify their needs and interests, plus how you can serve them from whatever level you’re at. Even a cashier who deals with one shopper at a time can have a broad, positive impact by making sure each is given detailed attention. A CEO who never deals directly with a customer can meet their needs by basing company decisions on data and feedback from buyers. In short, everyone and anyone can know the customer and serve them better. You can think broadly here: Maybe you don't have a \"customer\" per se, but your work can still require you to think of whomever you're doing that work for. Say you want to use kaizen to clean your home before your mom gets there for a week-long stay. Your mom is the \"customer\" you have to impress Let it flow: Eliminate waste, both physical and theoretical, meaning don’t take unnecessary steps, don’t clutter the space, and be direct in doing what you need to do. No matter what you're working on or how many people you're working with, this is where kanban can be a helpful complement, because it forces you to think over your action steps as you seek to meet a goal. Once you've identified what needs to be done and when, think of how you can scale each task back to only its most important, actionable elements. Go to Gemba: Gemba is the Japanese term for “actual place.” This means you should always be purposeful and direct about getting to where you need to be—which is likely to be where the action is happening. Don’t delegate anything you don’t have to, wait around on anything, or sit on the sidelines. Empower people: Encourage people in your organization, whether you’re their superior or they’re your peers, and make sure everyone is aligned in the common goals of the company and forward movement. If you're following a modified version of kaizen for a personal project, you can still take this step by not only giving yourself positive pep talks, but by making sure you have everything you need before you jump in. If you are working on that house-cleaning project, make sure you have all the right tools and are taking enough breaks that you don't burn out, for instance. Be transparent: Demonstrate your productivity with hard data and results and make sure everyone is always up to date on processes, developments, and goals. There are many ways to do this, even if you're working on your own. I personally love taking before and after pictures when I start and end a project, because seeing a finished product motivates me. Implementing all five of these in a working environment, per kaizen’s adherents, is the key to unlocking a culture of continuous improvement. If you want to learn more, there are dozens of books out there about the methodology, but you should start with the original: Masaaki Imai’s Kaizen: The Key to Japan’s Competitive Success. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        I’ve been using Fitbit’s revamped app, currently in “public preview” mode for adult Android users in the United States. While I like the simplified aesthetic, its functionality seems to center around the questionable AI that gave me so many wrong and confusing answers. Let me take you on a tour of where the new app has improved, where it’s falling short, and what’s still missing. Better: cardio load and key metrics are easy to readThe top few metrics on the home screen have always been configurable, but I find the new version is even more readable than the old one. You get three “focus metrics” on the right hand side, and a big donut shape giving your progress toward your cardio load. \n    \n            \n            Fitbit's current app is on the left; the updated preview version is on the right.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki/Fitbit\n                    \n    \nMeasuring cardio load as progress toward a weekly goal is a welcome change; previously, cardio load was a daily measure that often didn’t correspond to reality. There’s a downside to the new view, though: in the old version of the app, you could turn off the recommendations or hide them. In this version, there’s no way I could find to remove that metric from the top of your screen.\nBetter: separate tabs for fitness, sleep, and health\n    \n            \n            What you see on the Fitness, Sleep, and Health tabs.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki/Fitbit\n                    \n    \nFinding any specific data in the old Fitbit app always meant scrolling through a CVS receipt-length list of things you weren’t looking for. Items tended to be grouped, which helped a little, but ultimately some things need more space than the little card they were stuffed into. You couldn’t find your recent workouts without guessing on which tile to tap—turns out it’s Exercise Days (but not Cardio Load or Active Zone Minutes).But now, you just tap on the Fitness icon at the bottom, and there everything is! My exercise days and weekly cardio are there, then a listing of upcoming workouts, and then my recent activities. I can log a manual activity right from this screen. Perfect. (The button doesn’t seem to be working right now, but hey, it’s a beta. I can appreciate the idea.) Same goes for the Sleep tab. Right up top there’s a trend insight (“Your steps linked [sic] to better sleep quality”) and then I get my graph of sleep stages, and a list of “key metrics” like when I went to bed and how much time in bed was spent awake. The Health tab gives my vitals, like my resting heart rate and HRV. If I scroll down, I can set up alerts, update my profile, and the “coach notes” that the AI has written down about me. For example, I see “wants low reps and heavy weights” and “hates lunges.” Worse: glitches galoreI know it’s a beta, but things seem really rough. My workout from two days ago is listed as “upcoming,” and the app crashes when I try to mark it as completed. The old Fitbit app says that my high and low heart rate notifications are “on & checking” but the new app says I still need to set them up. Some of the AI conversations fail to load at all. When they do, often the bot tells me it doesn’t have access to the information I’m asking about, or it says that “internally” it sees something different than what I’m seeing in the main screens of the app. The team has a lot to fix before these features are ready for widespread use.Worse: structured data views are replaced with AI conversationsHumans invented graphs, charts, and other means of data presentation because these are easy to scan and interpret at a glance. The new Fitbit app can generate some charts (great!) but tends to present these as little cards to illustrate insights from the AI bot. To see more data, you’d think you could tap on a button or card about a recent run to get your lap times, running dynamics, and other information. But that doesn’t seem to be an option. Instead, I get a “continue conversation” button that seems to want to feed a screenshot of the AI output back into the AI bot. I’ve already written about some of the problems I’ve had conversing with the AI bot, so I won’t rehash those issues here. (It hallucinates in ways that are sometimes hilarious and often frustrating.) But even if the AI was as intelligent as it’s supposed to be, this would still be a major issue. The AI responses are slow, and I can’t always get the bot to give a straight answer to my questions. In short, it seems like the app’s designers said “we’ll have the AI handle it” anytime they weren’t sure how to build a feature. So the app feels like a mere wrapper around the bot, and the bot is just not the right tool for all those jobs. Missing: nutrition, menstrual health, and moreGoogle says that it hasn’t ported all the Fitbit app’s features to the new preview. When I asked about these limitations by email, the response I got was that “As a preview, the service is not yet feature-complete and lacks several functionalities to focus testing on the core AI coaching experience.” A full list of missing features is available from this Fitbit forum post. They include: Nutrition trackingHydration trackingMenstrual healthCommunity featuresBadgesSocial media sharingHeart rate zone analysis for workoutsRunning analytics for Pixel Watch 3 and 4 users (other devices don’t provide this data)Syncing data from Aria Air smart scalesThe post also notes that the AI coach treats certain subjects as off-limits for the moment, including those related to weight, body fat, running distance, and heart health measurements like ECG and irregular rhythm notifications.\n            ",

But what do I know? The company has announced it is holding its first U.S. awards show later this year. It seems the Oscars-ification of short form video is here.In a blog over on the TikTok site, the company said the show, fittingly called the TikTok Awards, will be held in the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles on Dec. 18, 2025, and will \"honor the creators who have inspired, entertained, and connected communities across the country.\"To that end, the site also says it will invite users to \"vote for their favorite creators\" starting on Nov. 18. So, how will all of this go down?\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWho is nominated for the TikTok Awards?TikTok says it will have announce nominees in 14 categories, including Creator of the Year, Video of the Year, Breakthrough Artist of the Year, and Muse of the Year, whatever that means. But don't assume you can put forward any old channel for an award.Towards the end of its announcement post, TikTok included a \"Meet the Nominees\" section that makes it clear the company has already chosen the competitors—and it might not be anyone you recognize. As someone who has spent a total of 13 hours on TikTok over last week (the things I admit for this job), I only recognize one of them.To be fair, the company says there are \"more to come,\" so it's possible someone I recognize will get added to the list of options. Regardless, it seems like the nominees are being chosen by some internal board, so your mileage may vary on whether you agree with the picks. Personally, I'll admit that a lot of my favorite channels are journalists, spicy comedians, and political commentators, so it's possible they're not showing up here due to an effort to appear apolitical and family friendly. (Justice for Dave the cat, though).You can vote Voting for the TikTok Awards will start on Nov. 18, and the company says you can cast your votes using the in-app TikTok Awards hub. While it's currently unclear how you'll find the hub, my guess is it will show up as a pop-up over your feed when you first open the app, as it did with prior TikTok giveaways. I'm sure nominated creators will also be quick to link users to the hub.It's unclear at the moment how many votes users will get to cast. Some sites, like Crunchyroll, like to let users vote on their awards once per day, likely to encourage engagement or discourage dummy accounts. Whether TikTok will implement a similar system remains to be seen.How to watch the TikTok AwardsIf all you want to know is who wins, then you'll be able to watch the TikTok Awards themselves live on Dec. 18 starting at 6 p.m. PT, with a \"red carpet livestream\" starting an hour before. If you're comfortable watching from your phone, you'll be able to tune in via the TikTok app, but for better TV integration, TikTok says Tubi will also host the program. If you happen to show up late, Tubi will also have an archive of the Awards available to watch on demand \"the next day.\"Can I go to the TikTok Awards In Person?While TikTok is promising \"an immersive IRL experience with interactive moments,\" it's not posting any links to purchase tickets, which means the event is likely invite-only. That's probably important for creator safety, but a bummer for anyone looking to help bring \"the For You Feed to life,\" as TikTok puts it.Are these really the First TikTok Awards?While 2025 is the first year the U.S. has had TikTok Awards, prior years have seen them come to countries including Korea, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. Likely, the delay has been due to the app's uncertain future in the U.S., but with a final deal now reached transferring control of the company to U.S. entities, it's likely TikTok is looking to make up for lost time by amping up its presence in the country.So, will you be watching the TikTok Awards? Personally, I'm not sure they jibe with what I like most about the app—there's a whole category celebrating people who sell via commission with the TikTok shop, something I immediately scroll by whenever I see it—but it could be a funny way to spend an evening, I suppose. So, basically the same approach I take with the Oscars—and at least it should make for some good hot takes on the accounts I do watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

This isn't a necessary upgrade for any reseller, especially not someone who is casually just flipping their own clothes and goods online, as most resale platforms—Poshmark included—provide the option for you to simply show the USPS worker a QR code on your phone, which triggers the label to print at the post office. But having access to my own printer has sped up and made my process so much more efficient. Yes, I could continue printing my labels at the post office, but it was slower and more confusing that way, particularly when mailing multiple packages at once. Here are three reasons having my own printer has been better. My label printer saves me timeWhen I wrote about the deals in October, I was considering getting a fancy, name-brand printer, but ended up going with the Vretti, a cheaper option at around $70, instead. I reasoned that this way, I could see if it actually benefitted my little side business before investing more money. If it didn't work, I could resell it and recoup my minimal spend. If it did work, I could resell it, then use the earnings to upgrade to the heavier-hitting one.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAmazingly, the Vretti started proving its worth immediately. The first thing I noticed was how much time I saved. In the past, I would gather up the items that had been sold on a given day, put them all in a bag, take them to the post office, and then pack them—right there in public—into their mailing envelopes, which I had to procure at the post office itself. Then, I'd get into the line with my giant bunch of packages, wait who-knows-how-long, and finally, show the agent the QR code assigned to each package, so they could scan them, print out the label, affix it to the package, scan that, then put it in a bin ready to be shipped out. This took me 30 minutes on a good day. With my label maker, I do most of that myself, since I also went ahead and bought some mailers. When an order comes in, I pack everything into a mailer, print my own envelope, walk over to the post office, and don't need to wait in line at all. I just set the labeled package into a special window and walk away. The part that takes the longest is the four-minute walk to the post office, but even that can be avoided if I set up a package pickup by my mailperson the night before. I'm militant about keeping my average shipping time low, so if an order comes through in the daytime, I try to get it out same-day, which means I rarely have the chance to schedule a next-day pickup from my own home. If I cared less about that, I could easily set all my labeled packages for at-home pickup and never walk to the post office at all, meaning each sale would take me nothing more than seconds to fix up. My label printer keeps me organizedSince I got this thing three weeks ago, I've made 26 sales. But because I typically sell bundles—or more than one thing at a time, offering a discount for bulk purchases—I've actually sold about 63 things within those 26 packages. Remember how I said that before I got my printer, I'd put everything in a bag and bring it to the post office, then pack it there? On days I had multiple bundles to ship out, that was tricky. I'd get confused about which item belonged in which mailer, have to write the contents on the mailer itself so I could remember which package corresponded with which QR code, and carefully coordinate with the attendant to make sure nothing got mixed up. Fortunately, I never mailed anyone the wrong order or made a major mistake—but it was time-consuming, annoying, and stressful. My label printer makes that a problem of the past. When an order comes in, I build it out immediately, pulling the right items from the shelf, putting them in a mailer, and labeling them instantly. Then, even if I wait to go to the post office until I have a few more packages to send out, there's no confusing what is what. My label printer makes me a more appealing sellerThis whole thing is very transactional and straightforward. I list my old clothes that don't fit anymore. Someone buys them. I get money. They get clothes. That doesn't mean there's no customer service involved here, although you can certainly be an impersonal, brusque seller if you want to be. I do prefer to send out cute packages that make the transaction feel a little more personal, though, and the printer helps me there, too. Because I can pack them in my own home and take my time with them, my packages are looking better and more bespoke than ever. I can write little messages on the label, take care to wrap goods in tissue paper, or otherwise spruce up my colorful mailers, all without someone in line behind me at the post office willing me to hurry up. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It all started last week, when Disney pulled its channels from YouTube TV, Google's Live TV service, over fee disputes. Now, Disney seems to be pulling content from other Google services as well. As first noted by 9to5Google, Disney movies are starting to disappear from YouTube's pay-per-view offerings too, and even other platforms like Google TV.For instance, try typing \"Avengers\" into your YouTube search bar right now. Aside from trailers and videos uploaded from individual users, you're more likely to see a rental option pop up for that 1998 Sean Connery and Uma Thurman spy movie than Marvel's superheroes. Meanwhile, Superman, a Warner Bros. movie, has a large \"Buy or rent\" button right at the top of the page.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe same goes for Lilo & Stitch. Currently, YouTube shows no option to buy or rent either the original Lilo & Stitch or its remake, but pay-per-view buttons for Dreamworks family movie The Bad Guys 2 show up front and center at the top of the page, just like with Superman. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nEven movies from Disney subsidiaries seem to be affected. While I was able to navigate to a rental page for Alien, which is now owned by Disney after its acquisition of Fox, I couldn't actually go through with purchasing the movie. Instead, I just saw a message saying, \"This video contains content from Fox. It is not available.\"\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI ran into the same issues trying to find these movies on other Google services, like Google TV (which also offers rentals, much like Apple TV) or the Play Store, but notably, all of the movies listed above are available on non-Google platforms, like Prime Video. Even older \"Disney Vault\" titles, like the original The Little Mermaid, are on Prime, but are nowhere to be seen on Google's services.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI've reached out to both Disney and Google for comment, and will update when I hear back. In the meantime, neither company has made an official statement about this seeming pay-per-view content blockade.My two cents? It's a negotiation tactic. YouTube's pay-per-view offerings are a separate service entirely from YouTube TV, and are thus likely unaffected by that platform's licensing deals. At the same time, in pulling more of its content from Google's other platforms, Disney can exert additional leverage on Google to pay up to stream its channels.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's not the only mind game going on right now, for what it's worth. At time of writing, it's currently the first major election day in the U.S. since last year's presidential election, and yesterday, Disney offered to temporarily return ABC to YouTube TV so viewers could keep up with the news. YouTube rejected the proposal, saying it would \"cause customer confusion\" and instead proposed that Disney \"immediately restore\" ABC and ESPN while negotiations continue, as a sign of good faith.\"Those are the channels that people want,\" YouTube said, implying that it is being overcharged for additional channels that viewers show little interest in. The company then said that if Disney is willing to play ball, it can \"get these channels live in hours.\"That's certainly more heated than we've seen past YouTube TV negotiations, which were largely settled before customers saw any impact, get. While it's possible Disney might actually take YouTube up on its offer, we're probably not out of the woods yet. Luckily for YouTube TV subscribers, YouTube is promising remediation if the situation drags on any further, and some have even started to see it. As someone who doesn't subscribe to YouTube TV but does rent movies through YouTube, though? I have to admit I feel a little caught in the crossfire.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

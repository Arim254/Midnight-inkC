Samsung announced the new smartphones at today's Unpacked 2026, touting their upgraded chips (Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy), pro camera features, and new Galaxy AI capabilities. It might be a relatively quiet update, but an update's an update. If you're looking for the fastest Galaxy devices on the market, the choice just moved from the S25 to the S26. When is Samsung releasing the Galaxy S26?While the entire S26 lineup is currently available to preorder, they aren't yet available to purchase. Samsung is making users wait a bit—two weeks, to be exact. Preorders start today, Feb. 25, while the units themselves will be available in stores starting March 11. \nStill, even if you have two weeks to buy any of the S26 series, you might want to consider preordering them ahead of time if you want to secure your device. The newest smartphones from companies like Samsung tend to sell out on release, pushing shipping dates back further than the official release date. That's no guarantee it'll happen this time, but preorder sets your place in line if you're sure which model you want. How much does the Galaxy S26 cost?Three phones, three different starting prices:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nthe Galaxy S26 is the smallest of the bunch, and costs the least, starting at $899.99the S26 Plus starts at $1,099.99the S26 Ultra starts at $1,299.99Those are just the entry prices, of course—for the base storage for each device. If you want more storage, you'll need to pay more, though you could save some money, depending on the preorder deal you choose. Where to preorder the Galaxy S26 series (and the best deals)There are a number of stores you can preorder the Galaxy S26 series from, but Samsung would obviously prefer you to buy direct. The company is running promotions for preorders, such as trade-in deals, to knock some money off the price tag, but the best reason to go through Samsung is if you want one of their exclusive colors: Silver Shadow and Pinkgold are only available on Samsung's official site. Here are the current preorder deals I'm seeing:Galaxy S26AT&T: As low as $0 per month with eligible trade-in.

Devices like Ray-Ban Metas come equipped with speakers, a microphone, embedded cameras, and connectivity to your smartphone—all in a package that largely looks like a normal pair of glasses. That's great for enthusiasts who want a hands-free smartphone experience when out and about, but not so great for anyone who dislikes the idea of invisible cameras everywhere.There are two sides to these privacy worries. One is the personal angle. Many of us don't want the people around us shoving their smartphone cameras in our faces when we're out in public, but at least then we'd know we're being recorded. These embedded cameras are tough to spot unless you know what you're looking for, which means there's a feeling of always being watched by anyone walking past wearing glasses. On the other hand, there's the larger privacy concern that comes with the territory of a huge company like Meta. Just last week, we learned the company plans to bring facial recognition tech to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses with a feature called \"Name Tag,\" which would give the wearer insights into the people they encounter using Meta AI. Taken together, smart glasses pose an unprecedented privacy and security risk for those of us living our lives, when both our neighbors and law enforcement have the accessibility to spy on us without our knowledge. Of course, what can you do? If these glasses are legal, and they're relatively inconspicuous, how can you protect yourself from the average Ray-Ban Meta-wearing Joe? By the time you get close enough to tell whether or not they're wearing smart glasses, you're already in view of the camera.\n\"Nearby Glasses\" tells you when someone is wearing smart glasses in your areaEnter \"Nearby Glasses,\" a new app that spills the beans on smart glasses wearers near your location. As reported by 404 Media, the app is made by developer Yves Jeanrenaud, and scans for smart glasses' \"distinctive Bluetooth signatures\" (also known as \"advertising frames\") to identify them in your immediate area. Jeanrenaud was able to use a directory of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) manufacturers to build a list of smart glasses the app can scan for, including devices from Meta, Luxottica Group S.p.A, and Snap. If the app spots one, it sends you a push notification.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe app can't currently distinguish between smart glasses and mixed reality headsets, however. As such, you may get an alert saying there are smart glasses nearby, but because the app picked up the Bluetooth signals from a Meta Quest headset. That said, these are much easier to spot than smart glasses, and are far less likely to be worn inconspicuously in public spaces.    Nearby Glasses is available for Android today, on both the Play Store as well as Github. Jeanrenaud says an iOS port \"is in the making.\"\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Fraudsters are impersonating representatives from mobile carriers, calling customers and claiming that they've been sent the wrong device and need to return it. Obviously, if you follow through, scammers get to keep your phone—they may either to sell it or activate it using your information to perpetrate identity fraud. Scams centered on stealing high-value tech aren't anything new. In addition to regular porch pirating, thieves have been known to knock on doors, posing as couriers or company representatives attempting to recover a \"wrongly delivered\" item. Fraudsters have also used fake Find My alerts to gain access to lost or stolen iPhones. \nHow the phone return scam worksAs an editor at ZDNET experienced, the scam begins shortly after your new phone is delivered. You may receive a call from a spoofed number, and someone claiming to represent your carrier will have specific information like your name, address, and device model. They'll tell you that there's been a mix-up and you need to send your phone back so you can receive a replacement. They may give you instructions to scan a QR code, print a label, and take the package to a shipping drop-off point. In some cases, targets have been promised gift cards for the inconvenience. If you hesitate, scammers may employ a number of pressure tactics to get you to act. They'll tell you that delaying the return could cause issues with your device activation, billing, or warranty. They may continue to call with threats. Like many scams, this one relies on social engineering: it manipulates emotions and instincts to get you to act against your best interest. Fraudsters impersonate a trusted brand and use detailed information about you to make their story more believable. They use timing to their advantage and promote a sense of urgency. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe phone return scam also has similarities to the brushing scam, in which victims receive a package containing merchandise they didn't order so that scammers can write a verified review or boost sales numbers or collect personally identifiable information once you scan a QR code (an added component known as quishing) to learn more about the item. What to do if you get a call about your new phoneThe solution here is to simply hang up. If you are concerned about your account or device, call your carrier directly (use the customer service number from a previous bill or go through the official app) and confirm the mix-up. Don't engage with QR codes or any instructions provided on unsolicited calls. It may be alarming that a scammer has specific details about your order and calls right after your new phone is delivered.

If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.As part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears. While I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.    \nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther new features in this Release Preview Channel updateThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.  You can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.   \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

While the root causes of these problems tend to vary, there are some broad fixes you can try that should go some way to giving you an iPhone keyboard experience you can rely on—besides waiting for the next bug-squashing iOS update from Apple.Reset the keyboard dictionary on your iPhone\n    \n            \n            Resetting the keyboard on iOS.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOver time, the iOS keyboard tries to build up smarter autocorrect suggestions for you, but these aren't always helpful: The further away these suggestions get from the defaults, the worse they can get, which risks turning your sentences into gibberish. To clean the slate and go back to the beginning, open up Settings, then tap General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary. Type in your handset's unlock code, then choose Reset Dictionary.Add custom words and shortcuts to your iPhone's dictionaryThis may seem to contradict the previous tip, but by explicitly teaching your iPhone the words it often gets wrong, you can reduce the likelihood of those frustrating moments where iOS suddenly replaces the word you were typing with something else (e.g. \"he'll yeah\" or \"what the duck\"). From Settings, tap General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. Tap on the + (plus) button in the top right corner, then enter your word or phrase—you can add a shortcut for it too to help you type it more quickly, but it's optional. Tap Save to confirm.\nAdjust other iPhone keyboard settings\n    \n            \n            If a keyboard setting isn't helping, turn it off.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are more keyboard settings that are worth taking a look at under General > Keyboard in iOS Settings. You can turn Auto-Correction off completely, for example, and disable Slide to Type if your fingers have a tendency to slip across the keyboard. There are additional tweaks you can make through the Accessibility menu in Settings: Under Touch > Touch Accommodations, you can change the sensitivity of double-taps and press-and-holds, among other settings, which may help improve typing accuracy.Change your iPhone's keyboard layoutThere's not a lot you can do with the iPhone keyboard layout to improve your typing experience and eliminate bugs, but there is a one-handed mode you can try in order to minimize glitches and ensure your keypresses match up with what's on screen. To switch to the one-handed layout, tap and hold on the globe icon in the lower left corner of the keyboard, then tap one of the icons at the bottom of the pop-up menu: You can move the keyboard to the left, or the right, or put it back to normal.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSwitch to a different keyboard on the iPhone\n    \n            \n            You've got several options for iOS keyboards.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you're still struggling with the vagaries of the keyboard on iOS, you can always opt to install a third-party alternative: We've covered a bunch here, including Gboard and SwiftKey, and they typically offer more customization options than the Apple default. Once you've installed an alternative keyboard or two, you can manage them from iOS Settings by choosing General > Keyboard > Keyboards. To actually switch between keyboards when typing, press and hold on the globe icon (lower left).Or avoid a keyboard altogetherThere are also some more extreme measures you can take that maybe haven't crossed your mind. The first is to use a Bluetooth keyboard (via Bluetooth in Settings), which will give you a more convenient (if less portable) way of typing text into your iPhone. The second is to ensure dictation is enabled in General > Keyboard in Settings, then tap the mic icon in the lower right corner of the keyboard, and speak out your text. You can handle emojis, line breaks, text editing, and more, using your voice.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes.

There's now an AI DJ, and you can use ChatGPT to generate playlists. With iOS 26.4, which is currently in beta, Apple wants you to make playlists with its own AI tech. The upcoming update includes a feature called \"Playlist Playground,\" which lets you generate AI playlists directly in the Apple Music app—as long as you're running iOS 26.4.How to download and install iOS 26.4I do not recommend installing and running beta versions of iOS on your primary iPhone. Beta software is unfinished, which means you could run into bugs and glitches that may impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss. If you're itching to try out new features, it's best to ensure that you've taken a complete backup of your iPhone first. That way, you can always revert to an older installation in case something goes wrong. Even so, it's safer to run test software on a backup iPhone as opposed to your daily driver.With that said, if you're sure you want to go ahead and install iOS 26.4 right now, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Select Beta Updates > iOS 26 Developer Beta. Now, go back to the Software Update page and wait until you see iOS 26.4 Beta 1 appear. You can now download and install the update to try this new Apple Music feature.\nHow to create AI-generated playlists in Apple MusicOnce you're on iOS 26.4, you can open the Music app to get started with this feature. Tap the Library tab in the bottom bar, and then select the New Playlist button in the top-right corner. You should see the Playlist Playground feature here. (Note that this feature may not appear on devices that don't support Apple Intelligence, or if your Apple Account is from a region where Apple has restricted the rollout of AI features.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce you activate the feature, you'll be able to generate playlists with AI. From here, you tell the AI what you want to listen to. You could get specific, with certain artists, songs, or genres, or ask for playlists that encompass a certain idea of mood. Apple has some pre-written prompts to get you started, such as \"hip-hop party songs,\" but you can use your own text prompts too. AI-generated playlists have 25 songs by default, and you do have the option to customize the playlist further after it's created. You'll also be able to edit the title, cover image, and the description of AI-generated playlists. These playlists can be shared with others or displayed on your Apple Music profile, just like other playlists you create on the streaming service. It's similar in concept to other AI playlist generators on platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music. Try AI-generated playlists without installing iOS 26.4While Apple Music's Playlist Playground feature is a good start, it's not yet available to those of us who are unwilling to install developer beta versions of iOS 26. If that's you, there are other options out there for AI generated Apple Music playlists. There's the aforementioned ChatGPT integration, of course, but you could also use a third-party app, like PlaylistAI. It has many prompts for you to get started with, and can even generate playlists from music festival posters. The app does prompt you to get a subscription, but you can skip that prompt and use the free tier to generate a playlist quickly.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.AI assistants are coming to CarPlay in iOS 26.4As spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.According to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant. \nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstall the iOS 26.4 at your own riskThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers more in the way of manual shooting controls, with the added benefit of an entire integrated suite of editing features.Using Snapseed's built-in camera on iPhoneOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n    \n            \n            Look out for the new camera button in Snapseed.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer. \nOnce you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n    \n            \n            You've got some classic film styles to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.Up in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Pro controls can be called up in a couple of taps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.Most filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image. The layers button (two squares) at the top gives you access to the current editing stack, and there's also an undo button to the left. When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.It's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026. What the Google Chrome patch fixesThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data. CVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system. \nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat Chrome users need to doGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on. Chrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window. Apply these updates immediately by tapping the three dots and selecting the first menu item. Chrome will need to restart to complete the update. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.How the Google Forms job scam worksThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job. As Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials. \nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page. How to avoid phishing attempts on your Google credentialsAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms. This is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The refurbished Blink Outdoor 4 (two-pack) with Sync Module 2 keeps things simple and affordable. Right now, this “like-new” bundle is $62.99 on Amazon, down from $164.99, and price trackers show this is its lowest price yet. For context, buying new costs $179.99 for just the cameras without the Sync Module. These units are part of Amazon’s certified refurbishment program, so they’ve been tested and inspected before resale. PCMag gave the Blink Outdoor 4 an “excellent” rating, and our own writer called it a worthwhile entry-level wireless camera.\nInstallation is simple and fully wire-free. Each camera runs on two AA lithium batteries that Blink says can last up to two years, depending on usage. You mount it on a porch, fence, or even indoors, connect it to wifi in the app, and you're set. The cameras record in 1080p, with daytime footage clear enough to recognize faces. Plus, it has a 143-degree field of view, so it captures a wide area of your yard or entryway without needing multiple units for basic coverage. Infrared night vision handles low light, and two-way audio lets you speak to a visitor or delivery driver through the app. Motion alerts are sent straight to your phone, and you can access live view for up to five minutes at a time without a subscription.Storage options are flexible. The included Sync Module 2 supports local video storage through a USB drive (sold separately) and can manage up to 10 Blink cameras at once. Cloud storage is available if you prefer remote backups. Person detection and extended video history require a Blink subscription, with the Basic plan priced at $40 per year for one device and the Plus plan at $120 per year for unlimited cameras. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe system integrates well with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT, so you can pull up live feeds on an Echo Show or Fire TV easily. It does not support Google Assistant or Apple HomeKit. Still, for someone building a basic, outdoor security camera setup on a budget, this refurbished two-pack offers long battery life, local storage, and easy installation at a low upfront cost.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Telegram supports messaging individuals and groups, but it also has social media-like channels where you can post to thousands of subscribers at once. In this piece, I'll be focusing more on Telegram as a messenger, since that's how I use it the most. In my decade of using the app, I've learned quite a bit about it, and I'm here to share the best Telegram hacks that you should know.You need to manually enable end-to-end encryptionUnlike Signal or WhatsApp, Telegram is not end-to-end encrypted by default. End-to-end encryption ensures that your messages cannot be read by anyone without accessing either your device or the recipient's device, and at this point, it's become an industry standard security protocol for messaging apps. You can enable end-to-end encryption in Telegram, but it requires a few extra steps, and even then, the implementation is not very user-friendly. Secret Chat is Telegram's name for messages that have end-to-end encryption, and to access it, follow these steps:Open Telegram and start a chat with a contact.In the chat window, tap the name of the contact up top.On the next page, tap more, and select Start Secret Chat.You now need to wait for the recipient to come online and accept your request to start a Secret Chat. When they do, that conversation will become end-to-end encrypted.Sadly, you'll have to repeat this process with each of your contacts, which leaves you with two different chats per contact (a Secret Chat and a normal chat). The other limitation is that you can't access Secret Chats on multiple devices. They're limited to your phone and the recipient's phone, and won't show up on Telegram's desktop app. It's great for security, but not as good for convenience.\nDon't forget to delete your old profile photosWhen you add a new profile picture to your Telegram account, it does not automatically delete the previous picture. That means your contacts can still go to your profile and see your older profile pictures. To fix this, open the Telegram app and go to the Settings page (which is within the bottom bar on iOS and hidden under the three-lines menu on other platforms). Tap your profile photo, select the Edit button, and delete the pictures you don't want to keep.Disable unwanted notifications\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTelegram tends to be a bit spammy with its notifications. By default, you'll get an alert whenever any of your contacts joins Telegram, which gets tiring very fast. You can disable these unwanted notifications by going to Telegram Settings > Notifications and Sounds and disabling New Contacts. While you're on this page, you can take a moment to disable any other notification types you might not want to see, including Group Chats, Stories, Channels, Reactions, etc.Change when Telegram auto-deletes your accountTelegram is a bit aggressive about deleting inactive accounts. It will automatically delete your account if you don't use the app for six months. This isn't going to bother regular users, but it's a good idea to customize this duration based on your needs. Telegram lets you set the auto-delete timer for anywhere from 1 month to 24 months, so you can pick the option that's best for you. Go to Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security > If Away For to make the change.You can block Telegram callsTelegram supports voice and video calls, which is pretty standard for messaging apps. Unlike most of its competitors, though, Telegram allows you to block voice and video calls entirely. Just head over to Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security > Calls and select Nobody.Enhance your Telegram account's securityIt's never a bad idea to add a few extra layers of security to your Telegram account. The app supports two-step verification and passkeys, and you can enable both by going to Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security. Both options are located near the top of this page.Lower your data usageOne of Telegram's best features is granular controls for its various settings, including how much data the app uses. This is great for people with metered internet connections. You can access these options under Telegram Settings > Data and Storage. Go to Using Cellular and Using Wi-Fi to customize how much data the app uses. If you set data usage to Low, Telegram will compress media to preserve bandwidth. On the same page, you can also disable all auto-downloads for photos, stories, videos, and files. Or, if you tap any of these options, you can individually disable auto-downloads based on the type of chat. For instance, Telegram lets you disable automatic downloads of photos, videos, files, and stories from only group chats or only channels. This way, it'll still automatically download media sent in private chats, but not in group chats.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can also go to the Data and Storage settings page, and enable Use Less Data for Calls. This will compress audio a little bit, but can be helpful for staying under data limits.Automate the built-in power saving modeTelegram has a built-in power saving mode that conserves battery by reducing animations or disabling autoplaying videos and other intensive processes. Set it up by going to Telegram Settings > Power Saving. The slider at the top lets you set a battery percentage, and power saving will automatically turn on if your phone dips below it. I've set it to 30%, but you can choose a different number if you like. On the same page, you can also manually disable resource intensive processes, which I've used it to turn off autoplaying videos and gifs entirely.Telegram groups have useful granular controls\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nGroup messaging is one area where Telegram allows you to do a lot more than its competition. After creating a group, tap the group's name, select Group Settings, and you'll see a plethora of options. Under Permissions, you'll be able to decide if group members can send messages, voice notes, photos, videos, music, links, add members, pin messages, etc. On the same page, you can also enable Slow Mode, which enforces a minimum delay between two messages from the same member. If you set this to 1 minute, then members will have to wait a minute before sending their second message.I would love to see other apps also implement a version of Slow Mode, as it stops people from spamming the group with multiple short messages in a row. Additional settings include enabling Topics, which lets you create different \"channels\" within a group to keep discussions from going astray (separate from the social media \"channels\" mentioned at the start of this guide). You can think of these like separate channels in Slack or IRC, so in larger groups, you can have separate topics to discuss sport or politics. This keeps the main feed free of unnecessary messages and assigns dedicated spots for different topics.Telegram Premium adds features you probably don't needTelegram has a subscription service ($5/mo) that lets you access features such as unlimited cloud storage (with a maximum of 4GB per document), chat transcription, automatic translation of incoming messages, support for checklists in the app, the ability to see when someone was last seen online (bypassing their privacy settings), and more. These features are great for people who have channels with a large following, but for most people, none of these features are essential. Other than the generous cloud storage, you can get all of these features in other apps for free. And even cloud storage has strong alternatives, including small providers like Proton or larger ones like Google and Apple.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        For all its faults as a platform, YouTube’s video player functionality is easily among the best online. It streams reliably to almost every device you can think of, in your choice of both video quality and playback speed. But it’s the array of hidden features and interface tricks that push it over the edge for me. (Other video players, take note.) Here are 10 of my favorite hacks that make YouTube easier to use.Search YouTube video transcripts with Ctrl-FAlmost every video on YouTube either has an official or auto-generated subtitled track. While these are mainly used for captioning, you can also pull up this transcript on the web and use Ctrl-F (or Cmd-F on Macs) to search for keywords in a video and jump straight to the part you want to see.This feature has been around for a while, but YouTube has shuffled around where to find the transcript from time to time. As of this writing, the most reliable way to find it is to open the video’s description, scroll to the bottom, and click Show transcript to open it up in a side bar.\nSet a sleep timer for long videosFour hour video essays and ASMR streams can be great background noise to help you fall asleep. However, if you want to avoid getting jolted awake by that one really loud joke you forgot about, you can set a sleep timer to pause any video after a certain amount of time.On web or mobile, click the Settings icon on any given video and choose Sleep timer (on mobile, it may be under Settings > More). You can choose a timer ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. You can also automatically pause once the current video is over, which is helpful if you usually have auto-play enabled.Link to specific timestamps in a videoOne of YouTube’s handiest features is the ability to deep-link to a specific second of any video, like I did in the last section. There are several ways to get a precise timestamp link. If you’re on the web, you can right click a video and choose “Copy video URL at current time.” And on mobile, when you click the Share icon, you can tap the toggle next to the timestamp to add the precise link.If none of those are options, you can even create your own timestamp link. At the end of any video URL, add “&t=01h05m47s”, replacing the numbers with the specific time you want to link to. You can use any combination of hours, minutes, and seconds to specify the point in the video you want.Use arrow keys or double-taps for quick navigationMost video players at this point have some kind of “Hang on, what did they just say?” button that lets you skip 5-10 seconds backward or forward. YouTube has several. The most straightforward, on mobile, is the double-tap. Tap twice on the left side of the screen to go backwards 10 seconds, and on the right to go forward. Keep tapping to move forward or back by further increments of 10 seconds.On the web, you have even finer grain control. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move 5 seconds back and forth. Alternatively, you can use the J-K-L keys to move in 10 second increments (with K being used to pause the video). This latter method is borrowed from video editors, making it a handy way to keep your muscle memory consistent if you do a lot of editing.Move frame-by-frame with keyboard shortcutsYouTubers love putting walls of text in a single frame of a video that you have to pause to be able to read. On mobile, the only way to read these–or examine any specific frame–is to back up and try to time your pause perfectly. On the web, however, there’s a better way. While paused on a video, you can press the , (comma) or . (period) keys to move back or forward exactly one frame at a time. You can hold these keys down to slowly move through frames as well.Quickly fast-forward with a long-pressIt’s pretty common knowledge at this point that you can play YouTube videos at 2x (or higher) speed, but what if you only want to rush through a small part of a video, like an ad read? On the mobile version of YouTube, there’s a handy gesture to do just that, without changing your default playback speed.Simply long-press and hold anywhere on the video while it’s playing. This will temporarily cause the video to play back at 2x speed, until you lift your finger. If you’re already watching at 2x or higher, it won’t play any faster (or slower) than your current speed, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSet your video quality defaultsYouTube generally does a pretty good job of automatically deciding what video quality to stream at, balancing fidelity with bandwidth demands. You can manually override this on a per-video basis, but on mobile, you have a few more options to get broader control.In the YouTube mobile app, head to Settings > Quality. Here, you can set separate quality defaults for video when you’re streaming over mobile networks or wifi, as well as audio quality. The latter is particularly helpful if you use YouTube for listening to music or podcasts. If your wifi is reliably fast, it can be worth it to set higher quality defaults, rather than manually change each video’s resolution whenever you notice the quality looks degraded. Use incognito mode to preserve your suggestionsYouTube can get overly eager to show you videos even vaguely similar to one you watched before. If you’d rather not get a feed full of videos on how to fix a door, you can use an incognito tab to browse without contributing to your algorithm’s history. It’s a little tougher on mobile, but fortunately the YouTube app has an option for that.In the mobile YouTube app, navigate to the You tab. Along the top of the screen, tap “Turn on incognito.” This will let you search and browse without any algorithmic recommendations or contributing to your history. You can manually turn off incognito mode, or it will automatically turn off after 90 minutes of inactivity. Note, if you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, none of your benefits will apply while you’re browsing incognito.Remove unwanted videos from your historyIf you forget to turn on incognito mode, you can still remove videos from your browsing history so they won’t muck up your recommendations. To do this, head to your YouTube history on mobile or the web, tap the three-dot menu next to the video in question, and choose “Remove from watch history.”This is usually enough to prevent a video from becoming the algorithm’s latest fixation, but it also means you won’t be able to find the video in your history again. If you want provide any kind of direct feedback, like a thumbs down or a report, make sure to do that first. Otherwise, if you navigate to the video again, it will be re-added to your history.Master even more keyboard shortcutsBeyond basic navigation, YouTube on the web has a plethora of helpful keyboard shortcuts that you might never encounter that are worth knowing about. Some of them are pretty niche, but you never know when they can come in handy:Up and Down arrows: Turn the volume on a video up or down in 5% increments.Shift+> and Shift+<:> Speed up or slow down the current video playback speedM: Mute the current video.F: Enter/exit fullscreen mode.T: Enter/exit Theater modeShift+N: Play the next video in your queue or playlist.Shift+P: Play the previous video in your queue or playlist.Ctrl/Cmd+Left or Right arrow keys: Navigate to the next or previous chapter in a video.\n            ",

This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.   When and what time is Google I/O 2026?Google tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions. But if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years. \nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel. What will be announced at Google I/O 2026?The short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O. Like the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about. I/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware. (It is a developer conference, after all.)\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

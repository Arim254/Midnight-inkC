You can see how long each track is, who performed it, and maybe even the song writing credits, but you don't know why the artist wrote the song, or what each song is supposed to mean. You can, of course, scour the internet, looking at articles and blogs to learn more about your favorite music—or, you can skim Spotify's new summary cards that offer fun facts about each track. Spotify announced the new feature, called \"About the Song,\" on Friday. The feature, which is launching in beta, is available in the app's Now Playing View. When you select it, you'll see story cards you can swipe through that tell you more about the song you're listening to. Spotify says the stories are summarized from \"third-party sources,\" and in my testing, I've seen sources like Hypebeast, Wikipedia, and fan sites. The company also tells me that \"some systems\" of the feature use machine learning to generate these summaries, which means About the Song is, in part, AI-generated.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nAs with many of Spotify's new features, About the Song is only available for Premium subscribers. At this time, it's also limited to English accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. If you pay for Spotify in one of these regions, the feature is exceptionally easy to find. When you're listening to a song, just scroll down on the page until you see the \"About the Song\" card. If you don't see it, that song likely doesn't support the feature. Some songs will only have one summary card, but others may have more. If so, you'll see icons in the top right of the card window telling you which card you're reading. You can swipe left on the card to open the next. \nI've seen songs with as many as four of these cards, though it's possible some songs have even more. Some of those are all summarized from the same source—say, one Wikipedia article—while others pull from multiple sources to generate multiple About the Song cards. There are thumbs-up and thumbs-down options on each card to rate the summary, implying these are AI-generated. The summaries appear to be static once generated though—when I quit the app and return, the summaries are the same. I'd be curious to know if the summaries are the same for everyone who chooses a song, or if they're generated for each individual listener.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify has had a busy week. On Thursday, one day before announcing \"About the Song,\" the company revealed its plans to start selling physical paper books, which sync with its digital audiobooks. The day before that, Spotify revamped its lyrics feature, including the option to download lyrics for offline viewing. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The feature was intuitive, and to quote my colleague Jake Peterson, it's worked so seamlessly that it was almost like Quick Share and AirDrop \"were built this way from the beginning.\" But for other Android users, it continued to be business as usual, leading to awkward texts and emails to share files across iOS and Android. Now, though, Google confirmed it's working to bring AirDrop to other Android phones, too, including phones it doesn't make. At an event attended by Android Authority, Android Vice President of Engineering Eric Kay said, \"Last year, we launched AirDrop interoperability. In 2026, we're going to be expanding it to a lot more devices.\"To a degree, we kind of knew this was coming. While many Pixel only features are implemented via a special Pixel-only system component, Google added AirDrop compatibility to the Pixel 10 by upgrading Quick Share from a system level feature to a full-on app, with its own APK. That laid the groundwork for other Android phones to eventually get AirDrop compatibility of their own, since they can all use this app. For instance, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said in November that his team was \"already exploring\" adding AirDrop compatibility to Nothing phones, while chipmaker Qualcomm said it \"can't wait\" for the feature to be enabled on Snapdragon—commonly used in Samsung's Galaxy phones—in the \"near future.\"Now, it seems like the wait for AirDrop across the rest of Android won't be much longer. While Kay didn't give an exact timeline beyond 2026, he did say that Google is already \"working with our partners to expand it into the rest of the ecosystem, and you should see some exciting announcements very soon.\" That's it as far as official communication goes, but I've reached out to Google for additional comment and will update if I can snag more details. In the meantime, we do have a few possible dates where we could expect the feature to be announced.\nThe soonest might be the next Samsung Unpacked, where the company is expected to announce the S26 lineup of phones. According to rumors, that'll take place on Feb. 25, and it's not unusual for Google to make an appearance during Unpacked to discuss new features coming to Android that the new phones can take advantage of. Alternatively, Google might save the announcement for its next Google I/O event, which would likely be sometime in May. Or it could just drop the feature online without the fanfare of an official event.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEither way, I can't wait. I take a lot of photos on my phone for this job, and while sending them from my personal iPhone to my work Mac usually isn't an issue, getting them off an Android phone I might be reviewing can be a much bigger pain. As someone who's got an Android tablet, an iPhone, a MacBook, and a Windows PC all within 5 feet of me right now, anything that helps bridge these ecosystems together is a good move in my book.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

What if you could get cable for a single day, then ditch it? That's the basic idea behind Sling's 1 Day Pass. For $5, you can get  a day's access to ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, and a few more channels besides. That array will cover quite a few nationally broadcast sporting events.Unfortunately, like most everything related to watching live television in the age of streaming, this is more complicated than I'd like. A 1 Day Pass is only available for Sling Orange, which includes just a subset of Sling's overall offers. On top of that, Sling has always been a little bit confusing—an attribute it shares with the legacy cable companies still standing. But if you need one of the channels offered on Sling Orange, it's theoretically a good deal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sling\n                    \n    \nGiven it's February, and you might be wondering whether you can use a 1 Day Pass to watch the Super Bowl without cable. Sadly, the answer is no: The big game is on NBC this year, and while Sling does offer NBC in a few markets, local channels aren't covered by Sling Orange The same goes for the winter Olympics, which will air on NBC and USA; you'll have to make a different plan to watch the Winter Games.\nBut March Madness is coming up too, and quite a few of those games are going to be available via a 1 Day Pass, so keep this service in mind if there's a single sporting event you want to watch, especially if you notice it's on ESPN, TBS, or TNT.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, could one argue that it's easier to install an ad blocker and search the internet for a pirated stream than it is to figure out how to legally watch something? Yes. Yes one could. But a Sling 1 Day Pass can save you from that temptation (not to mention accidentally downloading malware) for just $5.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Now Malwarebytes has joined the ChatGPT app store, which means you can get some expert help when investigating web links, emails, text messages, domains, and phone numbers you think might be suspicious.The app is free to use for everyone, whether or not they're signed up to a paid ChatGPT subscription, and you can enable the tool via the ChatGPT app store or by entering the prompt \"Malwarebytes, is this a scam?\" Once you've used the app for the first time, you can access it again via the + (plus) button on the prompt box.Malwarebytes' ChatGPT app can test links, sites, and phone numbers\n    \n            \n            Malwarebytes will do a deep security dive into links you provide.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can paste just about anything you like into a conversation with the Malwarebytes plugin, but there are certain approaches that scammers will often take—including links contained in phishing emails—that make for good candidates to test this thing out. I dived deep into my email spam folder to find some URLs to test Malwarebytes on, and gave it a few trustworthy web addresses as well—you just copy the link into the prompt box and ask the app for an assessment.\nMalwarebytes successfully sifted out the scam links from the safe ones, even when it didn't have any specific information in its databases about the links I was providing. When it was unsure, it said so, with lots of extra context: For example, for one URL I was told the address was \"a legitimate email security and tracking service used by companies to rewrite links\" but one that scammers also used to conceal the link destination.You also get an assessment of the domain name: When given a link to a Lifehacker article, the plugin correctly identified that it was a legitimate domain with a registered owner, even though it didn't have any specific information about the URL. Malwarebytes was also able to spot domain redirecting, a trick frequently used by scammers.Phone numbers can be given to Malwarebytes as well: When I tested this out with a few scam calls I've had, these numbers were correctly identified as coming from scammers or at least being suspicious. I like the way the app gives you some context to its thinking (explaining how spam call centers work, for example), and will also offer up advice about next steps and how to stay safe.Something else I appreciated was that the Malwarebytes app has a memory inside ChatGPT: If you post a series of links and numbers in the same chat thread, as I did, then it will try and put them all in context (explaining why one URL is potentially more dangerous than another, for example).The Malwarebytes ChatGPT app can also look at messages and emails\n    \n            \n            You'll get a list back of red flags in email and text message content.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can also give the Malwarebytes app some text you've come across in an email or text message and get a verdict on this too—you can even type in a transcript of a conversation you're having on the phone, if you want. The plugin will scan the text for phrasing that scammers often use and will alert you of any other red flags.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI tried this out with a variety of spammy text, and again Malwarebytes scored highly in terms of recognizing anything dodgy. As before, if it came across something it wasn't sure about, it would explain the reasons why and suggest some next steps. The responses also include some detail on why different scam approaches are taken and why they sometimes work, and how they might escalate—so if you get a message purporting to be from a family member asking for help, Malwarebytes tells you why these scams are common and how they're used to steal identities or money.It's an intelligent system, in that it'll ask you questions about the texts or emails you've received: If it's not sure about something, you'll be told about extra checks you can run (like looking at the \"reply to\" address on an email). However, the usual ChatGPT sycophancy does start to grate a bit, as you're constantly told that you're doing the right thing and that you're right to be suspicious.The app taps into Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence, so it should be able to keep you protected against the latest threats (making it more helpful than a Google search or just a regular ChatGPT query). From the examples I used at least, it comes across as a security tool that's accurate, comprehensive, and easy to use—one that's well worth keeping close at hand if you come across potential scams you're not sure about.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.Performing this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.Unfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"Well, dang. When I reached out to Google for additional comment, I got the same response. It seems the eye of Sauron is upon us, and Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying. One user said the feature has now been re-enabled in Brave, and I can confirm that I'm able to access it on Safari with my iPhone using the Vinegar extension.It's unclear how long these efforts will remain operational, but at least we've now been able to diagnose a cause. Free YouTube background play didn't break on accident, and that means developers and users will have to be extra crafty to keep the hack alive in the future. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Shortly thereafter, it kicked off an early access program allowing interested users to try it out free of charge. Unfortunately, that honeymoon period has come to an end: Alexa+ has now officially launched, and now you'll need to pay to access its most useful features.While certain features will still be free to use, the majority of the Alexa+ experience is now locked behind a paywall. True, you might already pay for that paywall—but if you don't, it's going to cost you quite a bit to keep the features you've been test driving for months. (Of course, the standard Alexa assistant still exists if you don't care for the latest generative AI enhancement.)What is Alexa+?The new Alexa is much like the old one, but now behaves a bit more like other generative AI assistants, including ChatGPT. In addition to simple requests and questions, Alexa+ can handle more complex queries and understand context (meaning one complex question can be followed by another, without needing to repeat yourself). For all the hullabaloo around generative AI, contextual awareness is really one of the big improvements users will notice with their digital assistants.    \nAmazon has a big vision for Alexa+. It still wants you to use it to control smart home devices, run timers, check the weather, and catch up on the news, but it also wants users to take advantage of \"agentic\" tasks, or actions that the AI can handle on your behalf. In theory, agentic AI allows you to ask the AI to order dinner to-go, make reservations at restaurants, schedule an Uber, or book a home repair. I'm still not sold on the capabilities of agentic AI assistants, and I imagine most people will continue to use Alexa+ the way they used regular old Alexa, (e.g. asking \"Is it cold today?\" or telling it to \"set a timer for 10 minutes,\" or ordering it to \"Play 'Manchild' by Sabrina Carpenter on repeat\"), but what do I know? Maybe Alexa+ really will change the way people interact with their Echo devices.How much Alexa+ will cost youIf you're interested in Amazon's newest AI assistant, there are three different ways to try it—one free, and two paid. How to use Alexa+ for freeThe most basic, Alexa+ chat, is totally free of charge. You can try it by heading to alexa.com or using the Alexa app for iOS or Android, where you can talk to Alexa in a chat window, ala ChatGPT. Amazon says users can get \"quick answers, plan research, and explore new topics.\" But the thing is, you can't use Alexa+ chat for any of the things you probably want to have Alexa+ do. It is solely a web-based chatbot experience, not something you can connect to your Alexa-enabled devices. If you're interested in the full Alexa+ package, you'll need to pay Amazon one way or another. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPrime Members get a free subscriptionThe good news is, you might have already paid Amazon for the privilege, even if you didn't realize it: Currently, Amazon is offering all Prime members full access to Alexa+, including via the chatbot and through Alexa-enabled devices. Alexa+ also works with other Amazon services that come free with Prime, including Prime Video and Amazon Music. Seeing as over half the U.S. population has a Prime account, chances are good that if you're at all interested, you already have access to Alexa+. How to use Alexa+ without PrimeMaybe you're one of the rare unicorns who doesn't have a Prime account, but still wants to try Alexa+ on an Echo smart speaker. In that case, Amazon will offer you the full experience for a cool $19.99/month. That's a slightly ridiculous price, seeing as a full Prime membership (with all the added benefits, from Prime Video to free shipping) will run you $14.99/month (or $139 per year). You definitely save money by subscribing to the latter, which is probably a big part of Amazon's motivation here—Jeff Bezos will never truly rest until everyone uses Amazon to buy everything.How to enable Alexa+If you opt for either of the paid options, you can set up Alexa+ by simply telling your Alexa-enabled device, \"Upgrade to Alexa+.\" You can also use Alexa+ by logging into your Amazon account on alexa.com. And as noted above, you can certainly opt to keep the old Alexa assistant for the time being, whether whether you have Prime or not. While Amazon may do away with the legacy assistant in the future, it isn't forcing anyone to switch just yet.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is currently selling for just $44.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $99.99, and price-tracking tools show that's the lowest it has ever been. It’s a wired camera, so it replaces an existing outdoor light and runs on household power. In exchange, you get a 1080p camera with a wide 143-degree field of view and dual LED floodlights that emit 2,600 lumens.\nIn daylight, this camera's footage looks sharp with natural colors, and the wide-angle camera does a good job covering a driveway or yard on its own. At night, the camera switches to infrared black-and-white video that stays clear up to 30 feet, and when the floodlights activate, you get full color night video, making it easier to recognize faces, animals, or vehicles.You'll also get motion alerts on your phone, and the live view in the Blink app loads fast enough to check what’s happening in real time. You can also use the two-way audio to speak through the camera, turn the lights on manually, or trigger the 105-decibel siren to draw attention via the app, according to PCMag's review. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for the limitations of this floodlight camera, it mostly comes down to subscriptions and ecosystem support. You can view live video and receive motion alerts for free, but recording clips and using person detection requires a Blink subscription. The Basic plan costs $4 per month for one camera, while the Plus plan is $12 per month and covers multiple devices with 60 days of storage. Local storage is possible, but only if you buy the Blink Sync Module 2 ($49.99) and add your own USB drive. Also, while the camera integrates easily with Alexa and IFTTT, there’s no Google Home or Apple HomeKit support, which might matter depending on your smart home setup. Still, for under $50, this is a cost-efficient way to add real lighting and usable security footage in one upgrade.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension. Now, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.How to switch over to a Google accountFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:Open the Fitbit app.Sign in to your Fitbit account.Tap Settings and select Move account.Follow the on-screen instructions.During the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.It's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.What this means for youFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.There also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.Despite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem.

While the gesture is timeless, the pricing certainly isn't: While you might think flowers are something you have to get fresh that day, waiting until Feb. 14 to buy that perfect bouquet means fewer options and higher prices. Here's the case for ordering your Valentine's flowers as soon as possible.Why you should order Valentine's Day flowers right nowThe sooner you order, the less likely you are to pay the top-dollar prices the last-minute shoppers will shoulder. As the big date approaches and inventory dwindles, prices skyrocket. A dozen roses that might cost $50 a week before Valentine's Day could easily jump to $90 or more come Feb. 14. \nEspecially if you're planning to have flowers delivered, early ordering is a must. Florists are absolutely slammed on Valentine's Day, and delivery slots fill up fast. Last-minute orders often can't be guaranteed for same-day delivery, meaning your romantic gesture might arrive a day late—which rather defeats the purpose. When you order early, you can schedule delivery for exactly when you want them to arrive, whether that's first thing in the morning to start your partner's day off right, or perfectly timed during the workday to make all their jealous coworkers. In short, Valentine's Day is about showing someone you care, and nothing shows you care like putting real thought and planning into your gesture. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to keep Valentine's Day flowers healthy until Valentine's DayThe good news: When properly cared for, roses can stay healthy for five to seven days after purchase. And for even more value and longevity, consider alternatives to traditional roses. Carnations and orchids are beautiful and tasteful while lasting up to two weeks. Not only will you be choosing something more economical, but also, you'll be showing your valentine that they're more special and unique than a boring old rose. (At least, you should be prepared with a little speech in case your lover actually really wanted roses.) To maximize the lifespan of your roses (and most bouquets):Keep them in clean water.Trim the stems at an angle every few days.Remove any leaves below the waterline.Store them away from direct sunlight and heat sources.Add flower food to the water.Remember, Valentine's Day is about expressing your feelings, not emptying your wallet. When you plan ahead, you have time to think about what your partner would really love. You can browse different options, read reviews, compare florists, and make a thoughtful choice rather than panic-buying whatever's available.

But on Reddit, some people who already own Whoop 5.0 bands are buying up old 4.0 bands to get a bargain on the subscription price. There have been a few posts on this, but perhaps the master of this hack is Redditor u/thelifeofcb, who found Whoop 4.0 bands, new in box, at a T. J. Maxx store for $39 each, and bought several. This allowed them to extend their existing subscription—they wear a Whoop 5.0—for several years at essentially a $200/year discount.How the discount Whoop hack worksWhen new Whoop bands are sold through retailers, they come packaged with a one-year subscription. The idea is that you’ll create an account on the app, pair the band you bought through the app, and get credit for a 12-month subscription—since that was the main thing you paid for when you bought the band at full price. \nBack in the Whoop 4.0 days, there was only one tier of membership. When tiers were introduced, those subscriptions rolled over to a Peak subscription, the one that currently goes for $239/year. That means a 4.0 device—however much you pay for it—can give you a year-long Peak subscription. Redditors have found that pairing one of these new Whoop 4.0 devices added a year’s subscription to their accounts, whether they were a new customer or not. That means you can buy a few discount bands, pair them all, and enjoy several years’ worth of discounted membership. That $39 band is thus a $200 discount on each year’s membership. Some say that they received an offer to upgrade to a Whoop 5.0 band if they added two years' worth of membership (paired two bands).That $39 price is an unusually good one, but you can still get a significant discount anywhere new Whoop 4.0 devices are sold. For example, Amazon has 4.0 devices right now for $124, which is still about half the price of a Peak subscription. You can find them cheaper on eBay, but I’d be wary of buying a box that may have been opened. I’ll explain that below. Scoring a cheap Whoop won't always work, thoughWhile Redditors say this works—and it does fit with my understanding of how subscriptions are paid for and claimed in the app—there are a few pitfalls to beware of. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe first is that this applies to new-in-box devices that (1) are sold with a subscription, and (2) have never been paired. The hack would not work with a hand-me-down device that has already been used, nor with a new one that has already been paired and its subscription claimed. For example, you can’t pass the same band to a friend and expect it to give both of you a subscription. This means you have to be sure the band you buy has not been opened. If a store accepts returns of opened items, they may not realize that the valuable item here—the digital subscription—has already been claimed. If they put it back on the shelf, and you buy it, you’re out the purchase price and you still don’t have a subscription. The other issue is just the e-waste that this causes. You’re buying a device just to throw it in the trash. But I’d argue that’s Whoop’s fault, not yours—those devices are obsolete and headed for the landfill (or responsible electronics recycling program, if you can find one) regardless of what you do. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It’s currently $599.95 at Woot, a steep drop from its usual $879.95 price. Price trackers show the lowest it’s ever hit before was $699.95, so this is the best deal yet. Prime members get free standard shipping,and the deal runs for another three weeks or until it sells out. This is a tall, tower-style speaker that sits above the PartyBox Stage 320 in JBL’s PartyBox lineup.\nAt just under 57 pounds, you’re not casually slinging it over your shoulder, but its wheels and telescopic handle make it manageable. The big advantage here is flexibility. You can run it on battery power or plug it into the wall, which makes it easier to place where the party actually is. And once you’ve rolled it into place—patio, garage, backyard—the 520 does what it’s meant to: bring the boom. Two stacked woofers and dual tweeters push out stereo sound with enough power to fill large outdoor spaces. The bass hits hard, but the mids and highs stay clean, even when you crank it. The companion app lets you tweak EQ settings or turn on Bass Boost, while the top panel gives you manual control over sound, lighting, and custom effects. It has just about every input you’d want: Bluetooth 5.4, USB-C audio, AUX, and dual mic/instrument ports with gain knobs. Battery life is rated at 15 hours, and real-world use lands closer to 12, which is still enough for a long event.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, it’s not for everyone. It only plays properly when upright, and the front-facing design means you’ll get the best sound standing in front of it, not off to the side. It’s also heavy, and the plastic wheels aren’t made for trails or bumpy lawns. There's no voice assistant, no speakerphone functionality, and no real smart features. But if your only goal is to plug in, press play, and turn your space into a full-blown rave or karaoke night, this deal makes it a strong case.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It has a longer battery life and tiny tweaks that make a big difference, like a brighter screen, greater durability, and new software features. Right now, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm) is down 25% to $299 (originally $399), marking its lowest price ever on Amazon. \nIn PCMag's real-world testing, the watch delivered nearly two days of battery life and features a brighter screen with 2,000 nits of peak brightness. It’s also more rugged than its predecessor, with a harder, scratch-proof screen, a waterproof build (paired with a water temperature sensor and depth gauge up to 6 meters), and a dust-proof IP6X rating. It features Apple’s newest and smartest software, watchOS 26, which includes features such as Sleep Score metrics and enhanced safety alerts like life-saving hypertension notifications.Unlike the Apple Watch SE 3, for just $50 more at the current discount, the Series 11 has a thinner design with a larger display, and sensors that detect blood oxygen levels and ECGs, as well as other heart health and temperature sensors. The 11 also packs in an altimeter, gyroscope, compass, and ambient light sensor. Users can dive into their workout data via the iOS Fitness app, while the iOS Health app houses biometrics and ECG results. This model includes GPS, enabling real-time tracking of distance and pace during outdoor workouts. It also supports 5G connectivity, ensuring a stronger connection wherever you are.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re an iPhone user looking to upgrade your smartwatch or invest in a feature-rich one that’s ultra-durable, longer-lasting, and has 5G connectivity, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm), powered by watchOS 26, offers solid bang for your buck at its lowest-ever price of $299.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But what if you actually used the right ctrl key? Or what if you prefer Claude or ChatGPT to Copilot? Whatever your reason for not loving the Copilot key, don't worry—you can change it. Here's how to do so in the Windows settings or, if necessary, using Microsoft Powertoys.How to change the Copilot key in settingsOpen the Settings application and head to the Personalization section. You should find a Customize Copilot key option here, assuming you're using a recent-ish version of Windows 11. Click the drop-down menu and you'll have three options: Copilot, Search, and Custom. You can change the button to Search if you'd rather use the key to bring up the Windows search tool instead of Copilot.Alternatively, you can use the Custom option to launch any application on your computer instead of Copilot. This could be a useful way to open the Claude or ChatGPT desktop apps instead of Copilot. Or, if you're not a big AI fan, you could just have it open your browser.\nThis is a limited number of options, granted, but it's easy and doesn't require any sort of tools. It's your simplest option.How to change the Copilot key using Microsoft PowertoysYou may have noticed that the options in Settings don't let you remap the Copilot key to the ctrl key, or any other key—all you can do is launch an application. For that, you're going to need to install Powertoys, the secret Microsoft app that improves Windows.After installing, go to the Keyboard Manager section. The simplest thing to do, which may or may not work on your computer, is to click Remap keys. You should be able to press your Copilot key to remap it (it will show up as F23, which we'll get to). Now you can choose what you want the key to serve as. This could be ctrl, if you like, or it could be any other key. Click OK, and you should be done.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThere's a chance this won't work for you. Why? Because the Copilot key works a little differently depending on what kind of laptop you have. Buckle up: This gets complicated in a very Microsoft-y way.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn many computers, the Copilot key functions as an F23 key. This is a workaround, of sorts, allowing Microsoft to add a key without changing the operating system very much. Most modern keyboards only have one row of function keys—around 12 in total. Keyboards in the 80's and 90's sometimes had two rows of keys—around 24 in total. Windows, to this day, still supports all 24 keys, even though basically no one has that many function keys. Microsoft took advantage of this—on many laptops the Copilot key functions as an F23 key.But this is Windows, so of course it's more complicated than that. On some laptops, pressing the Copilot key triggers a keyboard shortcut: Windows-Shift-F23. This means you can't use the Remap keys function in Powertoys to remap the Copilot key, because the Copilot key already triggers a keyboard shortcut.What you can do is use the Remap a shortcut option. Use this, then press the Copilot key as your selection. You should see the keyboard shortcut Windows-Shift-F23 show up. Now choose what you want to remap your Copilot key to.This works, with a caveat: You really can't use it to bring back your ctrl key, as users have noted on Github. The issue is that you can't remap a keyboard shortcut to a modifier key, just to a single keypress. It's not clear what could fix this, and I suspect users of such laptops are just stuck. Which is all to say that you might not be able to get your control key back, but least you can remap the key to do something else.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That also undercuts its current $339.99 price on Amazon, and price trackers suggest this is the lowest it has ever been. Woot's deal runs for another three weeks or until stock sells out, so don't wait too long to make a decision here. Amazon Prime members get free standard shipping (while everyone else pays $6), though shipping is limited to the contiguous U.S. \nThis is Samsung’s most feature-heavy watch, and the LTE connectivity means you can leave your phone at home and still take calls, send texts, and stream music. That alone gives it a strong edge over wifi-only smartwatches, especially for runners, cyclists, or folks trying to spend less time glued to their phones.This model is part of Samsung’s latest Watch 8 lineup, which launched last summer, and it has already earned strong praise, including an “excellent” review from PCMag, which named it the best Android smartwatch of 2025. Its Super AMOLED display is bright enough to read outdoors, even in harsh sunlight, and the interface feels responsive thanks to Samsung’s Exynos W1000 processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health tracking goes well beyond steps, with support for a wide range of fitness and wellness tools, including heart rate, ECG, temperature, blood oxygen, and even antioxidant levels. Google Gemini also comes preloaded for smarter voice control. That said, this watch plays best with Samsung phones. You’ll need any Android 12+ phone to use it, but some of the more advanced features, like snoring detection, are locked to Samsung devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe trade-off, as with most Samsung watches, is battery life. Real-world usage lands around 26 hours, so daily charging is part of the routine. That won’t work for everyone. On the upside, durability is solid, with IP68 dust and water resistance, a 5ATM swim rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification for tougher conditions. If you’re all-in on Samsung and want a fully independent smartwatch, this deal makes a lot of sense, especially at this price. But, if you’re still weighing options, see how it stacks up against Google’s flagship wearable, the Pixel Watch 4, here.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The result is smoother, sharper visuals with better contrast, so you don’t have to deal with the dreaded slow-motion lag when you’re in the zone. LG’s UltraGear monitors are known for leading the charge in this area, and right now, the highly rated 27-inch LG 27GX700A-B Ultragear OLED monitor is 41% off at $473.99 (originally $799.99), taking more than $300 off the price tag. \nThis QHD OLED monitor delivers deep blacks and infinite contrast with vibrant colors and 1300 nit brightness (very high for an OLED, though the tradeoff may be some color accuracy), as well as a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03 response time for smoother gameplay. Dark scenes are enhanced by DisplayHDR True Black 400 plus OLED per-pixel lighting, while FreeSync Premium Pro and G-Sync keep frames steady and eliminate tearing. It’s also UL-certified as anti-glare with a matte screen compared to similar models from competitors with a TrueBlack Glossy coating—and it’s flicker-free with low blue light emission.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFor serious gamers looking to upgrade to crisp OLED visuals with maximum brightness, better motion clarity thanks to a high refresh rate and best-in-class contrast, the LG 27GX700A-B Ultragear OLED monitor takes blurry guesswork out of the equation. While it doesn’t have 4K detail or the immersive scale of a larger curved monitor, at a rare 41% discount, you’ll be hard-pressed to find comparable quality at a sub-$500 price point. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

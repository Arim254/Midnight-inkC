Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.On Friday, Oct. 3, Discord announced that a third-party service provider it uses for customer service efforts suffered a breach. It warned a \"limited number of users\" who had communications with certain Discord teams were affected, though the \"unauthorized party\" did not gain access to any Discord networks directly. In that initial announcement, Discord said a number of user data types might have been stolen. That included their names, usernames, email addresses, billing information, last four digits of credit cards, purchase histories, IP addresses, messages with Discord service agents, and \"limited corporate data,\" such as training materials and internal presentations. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhile all of this information is sensitive, it unfortunately isn't surprising to see as part of a breach like this. However, Discord also revealed that the hackers may have also gained access to a \"small number\" of government ID images, including driver's licenses and passports. As it turns out, that \"small number\" turned out to be 70,000. Discord confirmed as much to The Verge on Wednesday. If you were among these affected users, Discord will have reached out to you via email.Age verification is a privacy nightmareWhy did a Discord affiliate even have these users' government IDs to begin with? Age verification. Like many other companies, Discord now restricts certain content to minors. If you are incorrectly identified as underage, you're allowed to appeal and prove that you are at least 18 years old. To do so, you need to take a photo of yourself holding either a photo ID with your date of birth, or a piece of paper with your full Discord username. Discord outsources this work to a third-party, which hackers targeted in this data breach.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs 404 Media reports, hackers suggest they've taken even more data than Discord has acknowledged. That includes data on whether users were verified or not; users' home towns, states or counties, and countries; info on whether they had multi-factor authentication turned on for their account; and the last time they were online on Discord.This event demonstrates the risks of companies requiring users to verify their ages by uploading government IDs. Users in Texas must verify their ages before they can download apps on their phones, while a number of states require the same before accessing adult websites. No matter where you live, YouTube will use AI to guess your age, and, if it gets it wrong, you'll need to prove your age yourself. The goal is to protect children and underage users from accessing content they shouldn't be seeing, but by doing it this way, companies are putting users at risk: They're asking you to trust them with your government IDs, credit cards, even selfies; or, if not them, a third-party affiliate. As we can see with this case, a lapse in security means tens of thousands of Discord users who were just trying to prove their age now have exposed government IDs. What happens when an entire state's population faces the same? Or a whole country's?  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's scary how realistic AI-generated videos are getting. What's even scarier, however, is how accessible the tools to create these videos are. Using something like OpenAI's Sora app, people can create hyper-realistic short-form videos of just about anything they want—including real people, like celebrities, friends, or even themselves. OpenAI knows the risks involved with an app that makes generating realistic videos this easy. As such, the company places a watermark on any Sora generation you create via the app. That way, when you're scrolling throughout your social media feeds, if you see a little Sora logo with a cute cloud with eyes bouncing around, you know it's AI-generated.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nYou can't trust a Sora watermarkMy immediate worry when OpenAI announced this app was that people would find a way to remove the watermark, sowing confusion across the internet. I wasn't wrong: There are already plenty of options out there for interested parties who want to make their AI slop even more realistic. But what I didn't expect was the opposite: people who want to add the Sora watermark to real videos, to make them look as if they were created with AI. I was recently scrolling—or, perhaps, doomscrolling—on X when I started seeing some of these videos, like this one featuring Apple executive Craig Federighi: The post says \"sora is getting so good,\" and includes the Sora watermark, so I assumed someone made a cameo of Federighi in the app and posted it on X. To my surprise, however, the video is simply pulled from one of Apple's pre-recorded WWDC events—one where Federighi parkours around Apple HQ.Later, I saw this clip, which also uses a Sora watermark. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking it's an OpenAI product. But look closer, and you can tell the clip uses real people: The shots are too perfect, without the fuzziness or glitching that you tend to see from AI video generation. This clip is simply spoofing the way Sora tends to generate multi-shot clips of people talking. (Astute viewers may also notice the watermark is a little larger and more static than the real Sora watermark.)\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nAs it turns out, the account that posted that second clip also made a tool for adding a Sora watermark to any video. They don't explain the thinking or purpose behind the tool, but it's definitely real. And even if this tool didn't exist, I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to edit a Sora watermark into a video, especially if you weren't concerned about replicating the movement of Sora's official watermark. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, people were already posting like this before adding the watermark tool. The joke is to say you made something with Sora, but post a popular or infamous clip instead—say, Drake's Sprite ad from 15 years ago, Taylor Swift dancing at The Eras Tour, or an entire Sonic the Hedgehog movie. It's a funny meme, especially when it's obvious that the video wasn't made by Sora. \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nReal or not real?But this is an important reminder to be constantly vigilant when scrolling through videos on your feeds. You have to be on the lookout for both clips that aren't real, as well as clips that are actually real, but are being advertised as AI-generated. There are a lot of implications here. Sure, it's funny to slap a Sora watermark on a viral video, but what happens when someone adds the watermark to a real video of illegal activity? \"Oh, that video isn't real. Any videos you see of it without the watermark were tampered with.\"At the moment, it doesn't seem like anyone has figured out how to perfectly replicate the Sora watermark, so there will be signs if someone actually tries to pass a real video off as AI. But this is still all a bit concerning, and I don't know what the solution could be. Maybe we're heading towards a future in which internet videos are simply treated as untrustworthy across the board. If you can't determine what's real or fake, why bother trying?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

All of that is fine and well—though generally, following a Stack or personalized plan is better, since it reduces the time you spend deliberating and dilly-dallying and gives you a clear goal for the workout—but you have another option. In fact, depending on your goals, you have another potentially superior option in the form of a Peloton Program.What is a Peloton Program?Program is the term Peloton uses for longer-term, guided training routines that are tailored to a specific goal. They can range from a few days long to weeks long, but the idea is that you'll finish the program and be more prepared to do whatever it was you were training for. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhen you log into the app on your mobile device or Peloton equipment, you'll see your personalized plan first, followed by a subheading that says Your Programs. There, any Programs you're currently participating in will be ready to go. You can just tap it to keep moving through it with whatever class or exercise is next up. To access Programs and see everything available, tap Classes in the bottom row of the mobile app, then Programs up at the top. (It's to the right of Classes, Gym, and Collections.)Each program is designed by an instructor (or, sometimes, more than one instructor) and when you tap on it, you'll see information on how many classes are in it, how many days or weeks it lasts, and how long the classes are. You'll also see a summary of the Program and what it's designed for, as well as notes on which equipment, if any, is necessary for the classes. You can even see a week-by-week breakdown of what classes to expect. These are self-paced, so you can take the classes or participate whenever you want, but you should try to do them in the timeframe laid out by the instructor. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat can you use Programs for?This is the fun part. There are so many Programs and some of them are almost too specific to believe—but that's why they're useful. There's probably one in there that aligns with exactly what you're trying to do, whatever it is. A selection of titles:Strength for Soccer (one week, seven classes)The Power of Sleep (two weeks, 15 classes)Strength for Cyclists (one week, six classes)Floor Bootcamp (four weeks, 24 classes)Road to Half Marathon (10 weeks, 40 classes)Strength for Tennis & Pickleball (one week, eight classes)Strength for Skiers (one week, 11 classes)You Can Run Outdoors (eight weeks, 16 classes)Set the Barre (four weeks, 13 classes)Path to Inversion (two weeks, 12 classes)There is \"density training,\" training for people who golf, and training for anyone looking to pull off a yoga inversion. Again, these are specific goals, but with strength, meditation, and other classes geared toward them, you can take a more well-rounded approach to meeting them. Programs are also classified as beginner, intermediate, or advanced, so you don't end up in over your head or bored. One thing I like about them—besides that they help you create a goal-based workout plan and are so tailored to specific achievements—is that participating in them earns you extra points toward your Club Peloton rank. By moving up in Club Peloton, you can unlock discounts and early access to other classes, providing even more variety (and some smugness, if you're like me). \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Hand-written notes aren’t searchable on your phone or laptop, for example, and unlike your phone, your notebook probably won’t always be with you for a quick study session on the bus or train. That’s why you should take advantage of both methods: once you’ve written them out, you should digitize your notes in some fashion to make studying easier, blending the old style with the new. Here are the best ways to do so.The easiest way to digitize your notes: A cameraThe most straightforward way to digitize your notes is by taking a picture of them and uploading it to your Google Drive or straight to your computer. You can name and file the images however you want, and though they won’t be easily searchable, they will be legible to you. Though this is super basic, it’s on the list because there’s one major advantage here: After uploading the image of your paper, you can stick it at the top of a document and use it as a guide to further revise your notes in the space for typing below. Manual revision (especially when done right after class) is extremely beneficial to understanding and retention, so if you’re trying to grasp the content at hand, it might be better to just type and revise it all yourself than to, say, let an app or gadget do the work for you. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThat said, phones are getting smarter, and the built-in photos app on iPhone allows you to search for specific words within photos. For example, if you know you have a page of notes about the respiratory system saved as a photo, you should be able to search \"respiratory system\" or \"lungs\" or \"alveoli\" and it will search all your photos for those phrases. Google Photos has something similar.On that note, let’s talk apps and gadgets. (No judgment.)Use an app to digitize your notesThe most popular app for digitizing notes is Evernote, which advertises itself as a “pocket scanner” on your phone. You use an in-app camera to scan the document and, if your notes are “clearly written,” they’ll become editable and searchable. I tested this one out and didn't love it, but it's still the most popular and worth your time to consider. (You can read my full review of Evernote here.)For what it's worth, in a head-to-head notes app battle, I tend to favor Notion over Evernote, but in this instance, that's not true because Notion doesn't allow for the scanning of handwritten notes. If you want to hand-write into an app, try Microsoft OneNote, which is free and easily converts what you write with your finger or stylus into searchable, editable text and makes it available across all your devices with Microsoft’s tools installed.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse a smart notebook to digitize your notesTo make the writing-to-digital process super easy, try a tool designed for the purpose: A smart notebook. You have a few options when it comes to devices that turn your writing into easily accessible notes. The most popular is the Rocketbook ($22–$40), which comes in a few different sizes and styles and is simple to use. You write on the pages with the pen that comes with it, scan the page with the associated app, and then wipe the page clean to start again, as whatever was already on it is syncing to your device. I picked one up for myself when I started grad school and got one for my boyfriend when he went back to school, too. We both found it easy to use, functional, and simple to transport. While those are more like traditional paper and pen, you also have the option of a smart notebook that is more like a tablet. There are a number of these on the market, but Lifehacker's Joel Cunningham spent a year testing eight of them and comprised this list of the best ones. With e-ink notebooks tablets aimed at those who need an AI assist, those who require a lot of writing space, or those who also want to read textbooks and other materials on it, you'll find one that aligns with your own needs. Just be warned that with prices between $285 and $690, they're quite a bit pricier than the Rocketbook. Still, a resource that can help you through school and beyond is always a good investment. For what it's worth, the best-performing one of the bunch is the Boox Note Air 4C 10.3-Inch Digital Notebook ($530) for a few reasons. Its 10.3\" screen is big enough to write on, but not so big that it makes it hard to carry this thing around. The ease of writing with the stylus is notable, according to Joel's review, as is the varied functionality of its native note-taking app, which helps you not only write your notes, but organize them. Make a mind map insteadRevising your notes and turning them into readable, portable, and digital versions is smart no matter how you do it and you'll probably want to keep them, well, looking like notes. But there's value in making a mind map, too. Part of your revision process can be using an app like Xmind to create a visual mind map that shows the connections between the concepts, ideas, and facts in your notes. Studying with a mind map is helpful, especially for visual learners, because it helps you think critically about how everything you're going over works together, both while you're creating and reviewing the map. When you use an app to do it, your maps stay on your phone, so you still have the ease of studying whenever you can find time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.There's much to say about Sora, which is essentially OpenAI's TikTok for AI slop. But putting my concerns aside for what appears to be a glorified deepfake machine, it's evident the app is popular. OpenAI says Sora hit one million downloads in under five days, likely fueled by interest from users seeing hyper-realistic videos going viral on social media. But with big hype, comes big risk for fraud. While OpenAI made Sora free to download, the app started out invite-only, which only built anticipation for users who wanted in. As such, those users might open the App Store, search for Sora, and download the first app that makes itself available—especially if they can start using it right away. That's exactly what happened in this case. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs reported by TechCrunch, over a dozen fake Sora apps were made available on the iOS App Store following the launch of OpenAI's real app. These apps were either called \"Sora\" or \"Sora 2,\" the latter in reference to the specific video model powering these hyper-realistic AI generations.You might assume developers hastily uploaded these apps to the App Store in an attempt to pull traffic from users curious about Sora. And while that is true, a number of these apps were already live on the App Store long before OpenAI ever announced the Sora app—some of which were operating under different names. It's not clear how many changed their names in this situation, but it's apparent that many did adjust their names shortly after Sora launched. TechCrunch says some apps had been available on the App Store since earlier this year, while others were available since last year.  Apple's App Store isn't the only affected app market here. Google's Play Store played host to fraudulent Sora apps, as well. Taken together, these apps were downloaded more than 300,000 times, with more than 80,000 of those occurring after Sora's official launch. Perhaps the most successful fake Sora app, \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator,\" pulled in over 50,000 downloads alone once OpenAI released Sora. TechCrunch reports that these apps collectively earned over $160,000, all from apps claiming to be something else entirely. At this time, most, but not all, of these apps have been pulled from app stores.How to spot fake apps on your app storeFirst of all, if the app you're trying to download is trendy and popular, like Sora, assume there will be developers trying to spoof it. Malicious developers want to trick users looking for one app into downloading theirs, whether it's to install malware on your device, steal your information, or make money off you by running ads. If they know a million people are going to be downloading an app, hosting a fraudulent one makes for good business.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen looking through the app store's results page, pay close attention to the name of the app. Sure, it might have \"Sora\" in the title, but does it have any odd, extraneous words added in? \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator\" isn't the worst fake name I've ever seen, but the app's name is Sora, not Sora 2. OpenAI also likely wouldn't add AI Video Generator to its own product's name: They probably know the product speaks for itself, and wouldn't feel the need to clutter up the name with extra details. Instead, the real title is \"Sora by OpenAI,\" likely done to both distinguish itself from legitimate apps named Sora, as well as indicate that it is indeed made by OpenAI.Speaking of which, you should always make sure the app in question is distributed by the company that made it. If you're trying to figure out which of the Sora apps on your app store is the real one, it's going to be the one that says it's made by OpenAI. I'm not talking about the title alone, either. Tap on the app, and look at the developer name underneath the title. If it doesn't match the exact company you know develops the app, don't download it.You'll also want to investigate the copy and images advertising the app here. Is everything written well, and free of spelling and grammar mistakes? Are the images high quality, and reflect the experience the app it advertising? Don't download something that feels slapped together: Some fraudsters don't bother with the finer details.  Finally, make sure the app in question is actually available on the platform you're using. Sora is currently iOS-only, which means any app claiming to be Sora by OpenAI on the Play Store is a fraud. If you're on Android, you'll simply need to wait for OpenAI to make the app for your platform. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We have a primer on everything you need to know. Sales are accurate at the time of publication, but prices and inventory are always subject to change.You never need to pay full retail price for a TV. There are just too many sale events during any given year, and Amazon's Big Deal Days—the fall version of Prime Day—is one of the biggest. Below, I've collected the best deals on TVs from Samsung, LG, TCL, and more that you can still get before the sale ends tonight.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe best Prime Day deals on high-end TVsIf you're looking to get the best picture quality for your money, this 65\" LG OLED C5 model is an excellent choice, and is now down to $1,497. The OLED panel offers top-notch black levels and super sharp contrast. It also supports Dolby Vision HDR, and includes 4K upscaling to reduce some of the choppiness when playing older content.For a little bit less money, you can get a lot more TV. Samsung's 75\" Neo QLED TV uses quantum dot tech and mini LEDs to get sharp contrast and bright images (though not quite as perfect black levels as OLEDs). At $1,396, it's a bit cheaper than LG's C5, but if you want a bigger TV and are willing to sacrifice a tiny bit on picture quality, this is a great pick.The best Prime Day deals on TVs under $1,000If you'd like to stay out of the four-figures range, the Sony 65\" X90L Bravia TV is a great option. It uses full array LED backlighting to get better contrast and comes with Google TV software built in. It supports Dolby Vision HDR and clocks in at $898, which is a solid price for that list of capabilities.For those who would rather pay rent this month, TCL makes some of the best, budget-friendly TVs, like this TCL 55\" QD-Mini LED TV for $570. It uses mini LEDs for better local dimming and has a 144Hz refresh rate—though gamers can swap to lower resolutions with higher frame rates if they want even smoother gameplay.In the under-$500 category, the Hisense 55\" Cinema Series is down to $260. It uses QLED lighting for better color accuracy, and supports Dolby Vision HDR. It also comes with Amazon's Fire TV software built in, so you don't need to pick up a streaming stick (unless you want a different platform).Speaking of other platforms, Roku's own 50\" 4K TV is down to just $258. The main attractions here are Roku's stellar smart TV platform, with a robust app library and well-designed voice remote; decent picture quality for the money; and, of course, the price.The best Prime Day deals on TVs for gamingWhile many of our top picks will also be solid TVs for gaming, there are a few that stand out as worth a little extra expense. Sony's Bravia XR A95L ($1,998), for example, supports 4K at up to 120fps, for extra smooth fast-paced gaming. Its QD-OLED panel gets perfect black levels as well, so your games should come out crystal clear.LG's 65\" OLED G5 is one of the pricier options at $2,477, but it pulls its weight with a beautiful OLED panel, 4K/120fps, and support for both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync for smooth, tear-free gaming.Looking for something else? Retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have Prime Day competition sales that are especially useful if you don’t have Amazon Prime.Walmart’s Prime Day competition sale runs from Oct. 6 at 7 p.m. ET through Oct. 12 and includes deals up to 50% off. It’s an especially good option if you have Walmart+.Best Buy’s Prime Day competition sale runs from Sept. 27 through Oct. 12, and has some of the best tech sales online.

    "body": "\n        \n        When you’re working out and aiming for a particular goal,  it’s smart to pull the big levers first. Getting enough food, enough sleep, and enough training time will have the biggest impact on your results. But once you’ve got the basics down, it’s time to learn how to properly time your nutrition throughout the day. Timing doesn't matter for everybody, though. If your routine includes consistent meals and consistent exercise, and you basically feel fine, you may not need to mess with timing at all. You aren't \"wasting\" your workouts if you fail to eat afterward (even though everybody on TikTok may be telling you otherwise). You also don't need to nail down your timing to the precise minute. But there are some rules of thumb that can help you to have more energy during workouts or to fuel yourself better throughout the day. What you need to figure out before you start messing with timingThe most important thing in nutrition is to make sure you are eating the right amount of food, before you worry about what's in those meals or when you're eating them. We measure the amount of food in terms of calories. Eat less than you burn to lose weight, more than you burn to gain weight (useful if you are trying to gain muscle), or if you don’t want to do either, simply hold your calories at whatever level keeps your weight stable. To figure out how your weight relates to your calorie intake, apps like Macrofactor (or free alternatives) do the math for you easily.\nIf changing your body size isn’t a priority, you don’t need to track this exactly; just make sure you’re not accidentally undereating when you don’t mean to. And if you want to be fitter but you keep running into roadblocks—fatigue, injury—consider increasing your calories. Sometimes your body just needs a little more fuel. Next up is making sure you're eating enough protein. If you’re gaining muscle, it’s an important building block. If you’re losing weight, eating protein (and strength training!) helps your body to retain as much muscle as possible so that most of the weight lost is fat. And if you’re doing any amount of strength training or endurance training (like running), protein helps you to maintain the muscle that helps you do all of that. Once you’re consistently getting enough calories and protein, you have a lot more leeway to adjust your diet to your liking. We should all get some amount of fat—0.5 grams per pound of bodyweight or more. And carbs may not be essential for life (as low-carb dieters like to point out) but people who eat a lot of carbs have a much better time in the gym than those who don’t. Carbs provide energy for activity, and they prevent your body from turning to muscle tissue for extra energy. Finally, the rest of the nutrient content of your food matters, too. Fiber is important. Vitamins are important. Fruits and vegetables should be a big part of everyone’s diet. These things support health even if they aren’t the macros (macronutrients) you might be tracking. I mention all this because what you eat is more important than when you eat it. If you aren’t getting enough protein or enough vegetables, fixing that situation is more important than getting everything timed properly. But if you’ve got the basics down, let’s talk timing.Carbs before workouts help with energyWhen we’re resting, our body fat provides most of the fuel our body needs. The body is constantly using fat for energy, which is why “fat burning” workouts or supplements are just silly. Fat is like a bank account: the amount is determined by how the deposits balance out the withdrawals, not by looking at withdrawals alone.When we exercise, it’s hard for the slow and steady pace of our fat burning to keep up with what we’re asking our body to do. If we have carbs available, in the form of blood sugar or muscle glycogen, we use those as a source of fuel. If we don’t have enough carbs available, we can feel tired or sluggish. We might still be able to get the workout done, but workouts will often feel better if we’ve managed to get some carbs before or even during the workout.So if you’re feeling sluggish during your workouts, consider having some carbs beforehand. Also consider this timing if your workouts start out well but you get unusually fatigued by the end, or if you’re in the habit of training before breakfast and want to test out whether nutrition timing could give you an extra boost you didn’t even know you were missing. “Carbs” refers to anything with sugar, or anything that breaks down quickly into sugar, which mainly means starches. If you can eat a meal shortly before your workout, try classics like:A bananaToast or bread with jam, or just a thin spread of something else like peanut butterOatmealSkim milk, maybe with some cereal or granolaNonfat yogurt, maybe with some berriesA smoothie made of carb-y foods like fruitProteins and fats can slow down digestion, so you don’t want too much of them in a meal you have right before your workout. That’s why you’d want to go with the lower fat dairy options, or keep the peanut butter on your toast to a thin layer. But if you’re eating breakfast a few hours before your workout, feel free to go for the slower digesting versions with full-fat dairy, or even throw some protein powder into your smoothie.Sugar during long workouts helps you to keep goingWhen workouts go longer than an hour or two, you may need more than just a pre-workout snack. This is why marathon runners will suck down packets of gel while they run, and why powerlifters pass around bags of candy between sets. If you’re having carbs during a workout, you’ll want something that digests quickly. This means you want something that is more or less pure sugar. Yes, you should arguably avoid sugar in general in a healthy diet, but in the middle of a workout, sugar serves a very specific purpose. It becomes available to your body very quickly, the better to fuel you in the moment. If you’re in the middle of an endurance event, like a long run or bike ride, you may want to consume 30 to 60 grams of carbs per hour. Examples would be:Energy gels like GUDrinks like Tailwind or GatoradeCandy, like gummy bears (a favorite of runners) or Sour Patch Kids (a favorite of powerlifters and weightlifters)Many of us don’t work out long enough or hard enough to have to worry about this. But if you’re training for a marathon or a half and you find yourself dragging toward the end of your long runs, or if your lifting sessions can extend well past an hour and you find yourself resting longer and longer between sets toward the end, try a gel or a snack mid-workout and see if you feel a difference.Carbs after workouts set you up for your second workout of the dayIf you're planning on doing two workouts in the same day, or if you have a late evening workout followed by another first thing in the morning, eating after that first workout will prepare you for the second. If you finish a workout and aren’t likely to have another workout until tomorrow or the day after, you don’t really need to worry about this; just eat normally. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo understand why, let’s take another look at muscle glycogen, one of those carb sources we use during exercise. After a workout, our glycogen levels are lower. Over the course of the next 24 hours or so, we’ll eat carbs as part of our meals, and those glycogen stores will get filled back up. Eating a diet high in carbs helps to fill those glycogen stores throughout the day and keep them full. (You may not get as much replenishment if you follow a low-carb diet like keto.) But if you do two hard workouts a day, or if you just did a workout in the evening but you also want to be at your best for a run the next morning, you may want to replenish your glycogen more quickly. After a hard workout, your muscles are ready to store carbs as glycogen if they can get them, so consider a high-carb meal after your workout.Protein works best in small amounts throughout the dayThe most important factor in eating protein is the amount, as we discussed above. To meet the recommended daily allowance (the bare minimum that everybody should get, athlete or not) you want 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight. That would be 54 grams for a 150-pound person. I have a guide here to apps that help you track protein even if you aren't tracking your overall calories. But if you’re trying to build muscle, or if you’re trying to maintain muscle as you train for an endurance sport or as you lose weight, you want more—anywhere between 0.63 to 0.82 grams per pound of bodyweight depending on how intense your needs are. That would be 95 to 123 grams for that same 150-pound person. Going over that amount is usually OK for your health (talk to your doctor if you have kidney issues) but not necessary.So what about timing? Well, it turns out that your body makes the best use of protein if you can get it in multiple doses throughout the day. There’s a myth that your body can only use a small amount of protein in one sitting, leading some people to believe that the extra protein is “wasted.” That’s not exactly true, but you probably will give your body stronger signals to build muscle if you can spread your protein out over four or five meals rather than eating low-protein foods all day and then having a giant steak for dinner. There's also a myth that if you're lifting weights, you need to have protein immediately after your workout. I should say it's mostly a myth, since having protein within a few hours of a workout is a good idea. Research shows that normal eating patterns are good enough to get those protein timing benefits; for example, if you hit the gym between breakfast and lunch, you're pretty much covered.A good way to follow this rule of thumb is to track your total protein, and to make sure you have several times during the day that you’re eating at least 20 grams of protein or more. That could be breakfast, lunch, a protein bar as a snack, dinner, and then a simple shake with protein powder in the evening. Protein, fats, and fiber when you want to feel full or slow digestionWe’ve talked about quick-digesting carbs (sugar, plain starches), but the flip side is that other nutrients digest more slowly. You don’t want that when you’re in the middle of a workout, but it can be useful at other times. For example, oatmeal tends to make you feel full longer than something like white bread because it’s got a lot of soluble fiber. Proteins make you feel full because your stomach holds onto protein-containing foods longer than other foods. (The stomach is just one of many parts of your digestive system, but it’s the one where proteins take some time to be broken down before being sent to the next stage.) Fats tend to also make people feel full, although this can vary from person to person. So if you’re eating a breakfast before a long morning of work and you know it will be a while before you get to lunch, oats (fiber) with almond butter (fat) and a side of scrambled egg whites (protein) will keep you full a lot longer than some toast with jam. Save the toast for later, when you want to have a pre-workout snack. \n            "

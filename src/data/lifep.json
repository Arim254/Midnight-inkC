Starting today, new users in California will have to scan their faces while setting up their accounts to ensure that they're both real and that they match their profile photos. Called Face Check, the new mandatory feature is the first step in a new initiative from Tinder's parent company Match Group, which says the goal is to help reduce \"spam, scam attempts, or [bots] operating automated fake profiles.\" When signing up, users will need to complete a \"liveness check,\" during which they'll take a video selfie from various angles. After that, the app will compare the selfie to profile pictures also uploaded during setup, and if it determines that they match, the user will get a \"Photo Verified badge\" and they'll be able to finish making their account. Tinder also says the system can determine if a picture has been used across multiple accounts to help prevent impersonation.While Face Check is new to the United States, it's already been launched abroad in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and \"several countries across Southeast Asia.\" According to Tinder, \"when coupled with other recent safety initiatives,\" Face Check has led to an over 60% decrease in users exposed to \"bad actors,\" and an over 40% decrease in reports of bad actors.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFace Check's debut also coincides with the rise of AI image generators, and while the company's announcement post doesn't explicitly call out AI, it's not hard to see how it could prove handy against bots using generated photos to pretend to be someone who doesn't even exist. Traditional catfishing methods, such as using stock photos, can be detected with diligent reverse image searching, but AI's ability to quickly create novel, believable, and specifically tailored results has made it harder than ever to know whether you're speaking to a genuine human online.At the same time, as other apps begin to collect personal information like government IDs, there is a privacy concern. Tinder says that Face Check only uses your video selfie to complete the verification process, and deletes it shortly after review, although it does generate a \"non-reversible, encrypted face map\" that is stored to \"help verify new photos, detect fraud, and prevent duplicate accounts.\"As someone who met my husband on Twitter (RIP), I'll leave it up to you whether that's worth it. Have you tried just getting real good at posting instead?For now, though, you might have to wait a bit until Face Check actually makes its way to you. First, Tinder is not forcing existing accounts to use Face Check, which is why I assume it's using a badge to indicate the accounts that have gone through Face Check, even though it's mandatory during setup. Second, Face Check is rolling out slowly. Tinder says that it will come to additional states \"in the coming months,\" although the company did not provide an exact timeline.As for other apps, Match Group (which also owns OKCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, among others) says it will extend Face Check to additional platforms in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Atlas lets you surf the web like any other browser, but, as you might expect, comes with ChatGPT integration. You can log into your account and tap into the assistant via the sidebar menu, which will remember not only past conversations, but your browsing history as well. Like other AI browsers—namely Perplexity Comet—the browser has an \"agent mode,\" which can take actions on your behalf. You can ask it to order you food through DoorDash or buy you plane tickets on Kayak instead of doing those things yourself.While that might sound useful to ChatGPT fans, I had trouble recommending the browser to people, considering the security vulnerabilities AI browsers are currently facing. Any browser that has agentic features is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: Bad actors can lace websites with hidden malicious prompts that the AI accepts as if they were written by the user. It might therefore take actions on behalf of the hacker, like opening a financial site or rooting through your email. Seems like a large risk just to outsource some basic internet tasks to an AI bot.But prompt injections aren't the only vulnerability Atlas currently faces. According to a new discovery, the browser may put the user's clipboard at risk as well. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow Atlas's clipboard injection vulnerability worksAndroid Authority spotted a post on X by the ethical hacker known as Pliny the Liberator. According to Pliny, ChatGPT Atlas is vulnerable to clipboard injection, a type of attack that allows a bad actor to access your computer's clipboard. The idea is this: A bad actor can add a \"copy to clipboard\" feature to a button on their website. When you click the button, a malicious script runs in the background, which allows the bad actor to access your clipboard and add whatever they want to it. Maybe it's a URL to a website designed to install malware on your devices; maybe it's a URL to a site impersonating a financial site. Whatever the case, you don't know your clipboard has been hacked, so you might open a new tab and paste what you think was the last thing you copied, falling into the trap. The particular risk with ChatGPT Atlas is its agentic features: When in agent mode, Atlas might click a malicious button like this on its own, without you even knowing it. One moment, you've asked Atlas to order you lunch; the next moment, the browser accidentally set you up to be hacked.Pliny says that OpenAI has evidently trained Atlas to recognize prompt injections, but the core \"copy clipboard\" function is hidden away from the AI's sights. It's a clever trick: The bot can hover over the button without knowing anything is wrong with it, so it \"clicks\" it without triggering any red flags. For anyone that copies and pastes items frequently throughout the day, this could be quite dangerous. You might copy something in one app, then ask ChatGPT Atlas to do something on your behalf. But without knowing it, the browser clicks a malicious link that adds something to your clipboard. You then paste in your browser window, thinking you still have the original item copied, but you're taken instead to a website that claims your banking session has expired, and you need to log in. If you're multitasking quickly, you might \"sign in\" without thinking, handing over your bank credentials and 2FA codes without realizing it. These are hypotheticals. At this time, there haven't been documented cases of this type of malicious activity affecting ChatGPT Atlas. At the same time, ChatGPT Atlas is two days old. To me, the risk here doesn't seem worth the execution—especially since I have no issue using the internet on my own.   \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's why I've been excited for FluMist's home delivery ever since I read about its FDA approval last year. My shots arrived this week (in nasal spray form), and I found the whole experience blessedly painless.The FluMist vaccine is a nasal spray, not an injection. It's available for people aged 2 to 49 (with some exceptions) and I try to get it for my kids when it's available. My youngest hates needles, and I sometimes have to call multiple pharmacies to find one that has it in stock. So when home delivery became available, I placed my order right away. How can you get the at-home flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine, called FluMist, still needs to be prescribed by a medical provider. But since nearly everyone aged 2 through 49 is eligible, FluMist’s maker (AstraZeneca) has a created a telehealth website that bundles the provider's approval with an order to an online pharmacy. The process takes about five minutes on average, the company says, and I found that to be accurate. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nI had already gotten a flu shot, so I ordered just for my kids. The website allowed me to add multiple people to the same order, so I filled out the questionnaire for each child, giving their names, ages, allergies, and so on. The website then reached into some big data cloud out there and told me it already knew their insurance information (existentially frightening, yet convenient!) and presented me with my bill: an $8.99 fee, which included $2.50 for physician evaluation and $6.49 for shipping and processing. Insurance covers the cost of the vaccine itself. Who can use the at-home flu vaccine? The at-home vaccine is the same as regular FluMist, which is approved for ages 2 through 49. That means babies and older adults will still need to visit a provider for the regular, injectable flu vaccine. Children can get flu shots starting at the age of six months.FluMist uses a live, weakened virus. It can't give you the actual flu, but it can cause some respiratory symptoms in people with weakened immune systems. So it's not recommended for people who are pregnant, have certain medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have close contact with an immunocompromised person. If that's you, talk to a provider about your best options. You may be advised to get the regular injectable type, which doesn't include any live virus. What happens when the at-home flu vaccine arrivesWhen I placed the order, I had to choose a delivery date (to be sure I'd be home and ready to receive it). It arrived via FedEx, with multiple texts ahead of time letting me know it was on its way. The vaccine needs to stay at refrigerator temperature, so you don't want it sitting out on your porch all weekend. I thought I would have to refrigerate it immediately—the instructions say as much—but it can actually be unrefrigerated for up to 12 hours before administration. So the box arrived, insulated and with the vaccine packages surrounded by cold packs. There was a \"TiveTag\" sticker on the interior box, so I followed the instructions to download the TiveTag app from a QR code on the package. It installed quickly, and then I just had to hold the phone up to the RFID sticker on the box. A screen told me that the box had stayed at an appropriate temperature the whole time, so I was good to go. How do you give yourself the at-home flu vaccine? Giving the vaccine is simple. To give you a sense: an at-home COVID test is about ten times more complicated. All you have to do here is take off the rubber cap, squirt the vaccine into one nostril, then take off the little spacer around the plunger and squirt into the second nostril. (The spacer makes sure that you get half the vaccine into each nostril.) If you've gotten a FluMist at a pharmacy, it's the same idea. Adults can administer it to themselves, and children will need an adult to do it for them. Instructions are, of course, provided. After I gave it to my kids, I clicked a link in a text message to \"report vaccination,\" which updates their health records in, again, some big ol' data cloud. (I will also let their doctor know at their next appointment.) After you administer the vaccine, there is a prepaid envelope you can use to return the sprayers for disposal. The paper packages and inserts obviously could be recycled. That left me with the cardboard box, its insulated foam liner, and six liquid cold packs that the FluMist site says are filled with \"non-toxic water\" and can be either poured out and recycled, or reused as ice packs if I'd like. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I told a local bartender I had an encyclopedic knowledge of film, and I would answer the hardest movie trivia question he could come up with in exchange for a drink. After a short consultation with Google, dude came back with \"Who directed 1922's Cabinet of Dr. Caligari?\"I tilted my head thoughtfully and repeated the question as if verifying I heard him right. The AI agent silently did its thing, and in about three seconds, the answer was floating before my eyes, totally invisible to everyone around me. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Stephen Johnson\n                    \n    \n\"Robert Wiene?\" I asked, feigning uncertainty. Boom! Free drink. It's not the hardest trivia question, but I could have answered literally anything: the date Dr. Caligari was released, the day of the week it was, or the weather that day—all short work.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBartenders know to be wary of bar bets, so this one was watching me like a hawk to make sure I wasn't looking up the answer on my phone or something. He didn't seem to suspect my glasses, and even if he had, it wouldn't have mattered. Even inspected up close, G1s offer no indication of electronics of any kind: No USB port, no flashing light, no visible controls. The AI agent is activated with a subtle tap behind the ear. Repeating the question sends the AI off for the answer, presented in a display that's invisible to everyone but the wearer. You could do the same trick with a pair of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses or audio-only smart glasses with AI.I don't like deceiving people, so I ended up telling the bartender what was up to and not accepting the drink, but it got me thinking about what more nefarious people than I could do (and probably already are) with AI smart glasses.Just imagine what I did on a bigger level: a team of hustlers at bar trivia silently tapping their temples whenever “which actor played…?” was asked would never lose. It's pretty small stakes, but not hard to imagine. Hypothetically, a hacked pair of smart glasses could be programmed to read the cards in your poker hand and give you the probability of winning in real time, either through the display or whispered in your ear. They could, hypothetically, make counting cards in blackjack effortless and undetectable. Stretching it out further, hypothetically, glasses could scan others players for \"tells\" that they're bluffing, or read micro-expressions to give a constantly updated read on opponents. Along the same lines, imagine attending a self-help meeting, and the leader, who you have never met, says, \"I've had a vision about you\" and begins to describe something that happened in your life exactly. All it would take would be glasses that recognize your face (supposedly coming to Meta Displays) connecting to a social media feed, which is then displayed in real time to the leader. Or you could go more subtle and engineer small \"serendipities\" like mentioning a movie someone recently saw and having exactly their opinion. It would only take a few of these and maybe some mystical patter to convince people you are divine being they should definitely donate to.How to spot tricky smart glassesI could go on, but you get the idea. Luckily, there are some indications when someone is using tech hidden in their eyeglasses. The most important is a general understanding of the possibilities of this technology. If someone seems to know something they shouldn't, ask yourself if their glasses could be the source of their power. Here are some more specific giveaways.Look for identifiable kinds of smart glasses\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Meta\n                    \n    \nThe most popular display style glasses, Meta Ray-Ban Displays, are distinctive looking, with a fairly obvious camera in one of the corners and a specific look and branding. But other kinds of smart glasses, like the Even Realities G1s mentioned above, are obscure enough that most won't recognize them, and so \"normal\" looking that most people wouldn't pick them out of lineup.Look for where the tech is hiddenMost smart glasses are still fairly bulky, so look for thick arms or frames where the wires are hidden. But again, that's only most smart glasses; some are totally sleek, with imperceptible tech.Look for a small glint In most situations, the display in display glasses is not visible to anyone but the glasses wearer, but there's still light being projected. In a dark room, you can see a green glow, and even if it's not dark, the display windows are visible if the light hits it just right, as you can see here:\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Stephen Johnson\n                    \n    \nBut honestly, it's subtle and hard to spot. Listen for the soundsOlder styles of audio-only smart glasses can feed information to wearers, but the open-air speakers mean some sound is bleeding into the atmosphere. You can definitely hear smart glasses if you're in a quiet room and you're trying to. If it's loud, operating glasses becomes problematic for the wearer.Look for the source of controlSmart glasses have to be controlled somehow. Meta Display glasses are operated with a wrist band. G1 glasses' AI agent is powered on by tapping on the frames behind your ear. Anyone who practices for a few hours could make these movements seem natural, but they're there if you know what to look for. Odd movements and speechIt doesn't take advanced stagecraft to operate these kinds of glasses imperceptibly, but it does take something. Tells might include small glances upward to see the display, tapping on glasses, stilted speech while waiting for information to come in, and a reading-a-teleprompter style of talking. Watch for people repeating questions back. But understand, it's hard to spot. When I was conning my bartender, I thought how I repeated the question back was obvious, but my wife said I just seemed a little odd, which suits the personality of a trivia whizz anyway. Smart glasses are powerful tools, like a hammer or a calculator. Like any innocent tool, they can be used for nefarious things, so until manufacturers or regulators require obvious indicators, like flashing lights or visible controls, we have to protect ourselves by paying attention to these small cues and staying skeptical when someone seems to know more than they reasonably should.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Users have spent that time generating hyper-realistic vertical videos that, despite their watermarks, might already be fooling people on the internet. I, for one, see nothing good about a tool that can make these types of videos from simple prompts, perhaps outside the sheer novelty alone. But the app is undeniably popular, and, as expected, OpenAI is continuing to \"improve\" it. On Wednesday, the head of Sora, Bill Peebles, shared a roadmap of updates coming to the app, from cameos for your pets to video editing tools. Sora will soon let you make cameos of anything you wantPeebles says that \"character cameos\" are on their way in the coming days. When this feature drops, you'll be able to make cameos of just about anything you want, including your pets (Peebles suggests your dog or guinea pig), stuffed toys, as well as AI-generated characters Sora may have produced in your past videos.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nCameos are a defining, and controversial, Sora feature. It lets you scan your likeness into the app so you can create videos featuring yourself. Not only that, you can remix videos with cameos of anyone else who has scanned themself into Sora—assuming their permissions allow you to use their cameos. It's impressive tech, but it raises major ethical concerns, considering you can make someone else do or say things they never signed off on. Now, apparently, you'll also be able to do the same with the family cat or your childhood stuffed animal. Following these additional cameo options, Peebles says you'll be able to see \"the latest trending cameos in real time.\" I'm guessing the idea is to browse the most popular cameos on the platform, and, if you want to, add them to your own videos. Sora is also getting basic video editing tools. According to Peebles, this starts with the ability to stitch multiple clips together, though other \"powerful new features\" will follow. Peebles says the Sora team is also working on reducing \"excessive moderation,\" which he acknowledges is \"super annoying\" to users, as well as improving the app's performance.Speaking of apps, Android users will soon have their chance to try Sora. Right now, the app is iOS-only, but Sora's Android version is \"actually coming soon,\" Peebles says.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA reminder to be wary of what you see on the internetAs critical and cynical as I am about Sora and services like it, I can see the utility here. I imagine people will get a kick out of being able to put their pets in any situation they want. And if they want to make fried eggs sing a song, or a stuffed animal say \"hello,\" more power to them. But my main concerns with this app are not assuaged by any of these updates: Sora still lets you generate convincing videos with a simple prompt, with the only safeguard a watermark that's easy to remove if you know where to look. People were already falling for fake videos on the internet before these tools came along; now, it's becoming way too difficult to know whether what you're watching is actually real or not. If you ask me, you're better off assuming all of it is fake.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the past 24 hours, multiple users on Reddit have complained about being unable to call 911, while the Bell carrier in Canada issued a warning that the Pixel 6 and up was also having problems contacting emergency services on its network.According to user Fabulous_Disaster730, who posted yesterday about difficulties contacting emergency services during a gas leak, her Pixel 9 Pro repeatedly prompted her to turn on wifi calling or turn off airplane mode before she could call 911, despite her having full signal on both 5G and wifi. The phone would then freeze and restart. After multiple attempts, she resorted to asking a friend to place the call for her instead.Multiple replies mentioned facing similar problems yesterday as well, across multiple networks and models of Pixel. Bell, however, was the only carrier to issue an official notice.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAside from the obvious danger, the problem with this bug is that it's not consistent. Despite seemingly having had a surge yesterday, it's been a known issue as far back as 2021. However, it doesn't affect all users, nor is it entirely predictable when or how it will pop up. While recent reports are of calls simply not going through, one user posted two months ago that their call did go through, but they only heard screeching and static on the other end of the line. These recent reports are only the latest in an ever-evolving concern.It's also not clear what's causing the problem. In 2021, the problem was attributed to Microsoft Teams, but even with that error patched up, users are still facing problems. To Google's credit, Bell said it reached out to the company shortly after it learned about yesterday's uptick in cases, and afterwards said that a fix had been issued. However, no other carriers have issued similar notices, and I wouldn't be surprised to see other users making their own complaints in the future.It's worth noting that Bell mentioned that Pixel 6 users and up were the ones affected this time around, and that the Pixel 6 also happened to release in 2021, which is when the bug first started making news. Whatever is at the core of the problem here, I wouldn't be surprised if it worked its way in on the Pixel 6 and just hasn't yet been addressed.However, given the severity of the issue, it's something that needs looking at sooner rather than later. I've reached out to Google for comment on this issue, and will update if I hear back. In the meantime, it's best to be prepared in case the worst happens. If you're on a Pixel phone, here's what you can do to contact 911 in an emergency:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, try to place a 911 callIf you have time and the danger is not immediate, it's worth trying to call 911 on your Pixel despite the issues. While users reporting problems have increased as of late, it's still not an everyone or every time problem. It's possible your call will still go through without issue.You can also text 911If, however, you are unable to call 911, it's worth remembering that in certain jurisdictions (check this regularly updated list to see if where you live is supported), you can also contact 911 via text. This is a slower method of reaching out for help, but is still better than nothing. To text 911, open your texting app, put in 911 as the recipient, and write a concise message with your issue, your location, and any necessary specifics, like cross streets, landmarks, a specific hiding location, or whether you're able to talk.Use a backup phoneWhile I don't expect someone who isn't constantly reviewing tech to have multiple phones on hand, the surest method to ensure you'll be able to call 911 if you're on a Pixel is to keep a backup phone that isn't a Pixel handy. This could be a landline or another cell phone. Crucially, it can be an old cell phone, even one that isn't actively attached to a phone plan. So long as your phone is able to connect to a network, it's legally required to be able to call 911, so if you have an old phone you've upgraded from and haven't traded in laying around, it may be smart to keep it charged up in case you need it in an emergency.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

AI personal trainers sound like a perfect solution. Download an app, answer some questions about your goals and fitness level, and receive a personalized training program. I've tested some of these apps myself, and I definitely see the appeal. But more than anything, I see companies stuffing AI into apps where it doesn't belong. There's Strava's Athlete \"Intelligence\"; Garmin's underwhelming Connect+ subscription; Whoop's recovery recommendations, just to name a few. And as Lifehacker senior health editor Beth Skwarecki points out, people are increasingly asking ChatGPT for training advice, which is infuriating considering how many high-quality, free programs are already out there. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMedical professionals and trainers are increasingly noticing clients experiencing anxiety around optimization and performance, becoming discouraged when AI labels their efforts as inadequate. Think of how something like \"closing your rings\" on Apple Watch activity goals had a chokehold over the nation. Or Fitbit step counts, even when step goals are bullshit in the first place. When metrics don't align with expectations, people feel like failures. And it's not because they haven't made progress, but because an algorithm told them so. Blind trust and data obsessionCertified personal trainer Cara D'Orazio describes what she calls \"digital guilt\"—the anxiety that creeps in when you miss a workout notification or can't keep up with your app's demands. She recalls clients who arrived at her gym burnt out and demoralized, including one woman whose AI coach prescribed six consecutive training days without rest. The woman felt \"lazy\" for being sore—a natural physiological response her digital trainer couldn't recognize or validate.\"People begin relying so much on the algorithm that they lose connection with how their body actually feels,\" D'Orazio says. \"A real coach can tell when your stress levels are high, when you didn't sleep, or when you just need to talk for five minutes before starting. AI doesn't do that. It only sees numbers—calories, steps, heart rate—not emotions, hormones, or mindset.\" Movement should enhance your relationship with your body, not create anxiety around it. This disconnection is particularly dangerous when you consider how deeply intertwined your fitness can be with your mental health. Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness, has witnessed the psychological toll firsthand. \"I have definitely seen folks get discouraged and even anxious when they rely too heavily on AI fitness enhanced tools,\" he explains. \"While it is great that these apps can track everything, they are lacking a bit on the balance and self compassion side of fitness.\" I know that when I'm in a vulnerable mental state, this lack of empathy can be devastating. As D'Orazio warns, \"If we're not careful, we're going to see a whole new wave of people who are 'fit' on paper but emotionally exhausted and disconnected from their bodies.\" The constant performance feedback is a recipe for an unhealthy fixation on fitness goals.The human touch AI simply can't replaceOutside of fitness, one of AI's most significant limitations is its inability to read context. Adrian Kelly, a business and sports performance coach, emphasizes the risks here: \"Exercise can be quite an emotional experience with highs and lows generated by meeting, or failing to meet, our own expectations.\" He notes that traditional trainer-client relationships provide something AI cannot replicate: empathy, accountability, and trust built through genuine human connection. A skilled coach recognizes early warning signs of disordered eating, overtraining, or emotional distress. They celebrate non-scale victories, adjust plans when life gets complicated, and remind you that rest is productive.\"The healthiest results come from building trust, flexibility, and self-awareness—things a machine simply can't measure,\" D'Orazio says. \"Movement should make you feel more human, not less.\"Dr. Ayesha Bryant, a clinical advisor at Alpas Wellness, warns about the unhealthy fixation on health data that AI systems encourage. \"This heavy quantification of fitness can drive clients and patients to perfectionism or body dysmorphia tendencies, especially in vulnerable individuals,\" Bryant says. The problem is compounded by all that blind trust in the algorithm, where users continue following AI recommendations even when experiencing pain, burnout, or clear signs they need rest or medical attention.Even if someone is self-aware enough to override AI recommendations, there's still the need for algorithmic validation. It's all too easy to shift from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation, forgetting that the whole point of moving your body is because it feels good. The bottom line: Find some balanceThis isn't to say AI fitness tools have no place in a healthy lifestyle. They can be useful for tracking data, setting reminders, or logging workouts. But they should complement—not replace—human guidance and your own body awareness.Weber recommends that anyone training regularly \"consider checking in with a PT of some sort just to make sure you are still being kind to yourself.\" Bryant agrees, emphasizing that \"long-term wellness and quality of life is driven by empathy, adaptability, and human connections.\"If the fitness industry's AI revolution has arrived, we need to approach it with clear eyes. Your body is not a machine to be optimized. It's a complex, intelligent system that deserves compassion, flexibility, and human understanding—things no algorithm can provide.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Windows RE offers a series of functions to help you root out whatever is ailing your machine. Using it, you can choose to reset your computer, run an automated diagnosis and repair tool, adjust settings to see if any are causing the issue, uninstall previous updates that might be tripping up Windows, and restore to a previous back Windows backup, among other potentially helpful options. It's a necessary feature of the operating system, meant for times when a simple shut down and restart doesn't help your PC get back to normal operations. So it's not ideal when Windows ships with a bug that not only breaks part of the OS, but also breaks the part of the OS designed to help fix your PC.As spotted by Tom's Hardware, a bug in Windows 11's October update, KB5066835, hinders your ability to access Windows RE. The recovery environment can still load if you need it, but you'll find you won't be able to select any of the options it offers to try to fix your PC. That's because this bug breaks USB device functionality specifically in Windows RE. Simply stated, your mouse and keyboard will not work in Windows RE, preventing any navigation within the recovery environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is obviously bad news for anyone who wants to use Windows RE to fix a problem with their PC—including, ironically, this Windows RE-specific bug. But you might think that so long as your particular issue with Windows isn't prohibiting you from actually using your computer, you could live without Windows RE for the time being. As Tom's Hardware points out, however, it's not so simple: When your PC has trouble starting up, it will automatically boot into the recovery environment. That's normally a good thing, since you'll have the tools to help diagnose and solve the issue. However, when Windows takes you to a screen where you can't use your mouse and keyboard, or interact with any elements whatsoever, you're kind of stuck. Microsoft has issued a patchThe good news is a fix is officially here. Microsoft had called out the bug as a known issue in Windows 11, version 25H2, and said it was working on releasing a fix \"in the coming days.\" That fix came sooner than expected. The new KB5070773 update restores USB device functionality in Windows RE, so you should update as soon as possible. If you have normal access to Windows, all you need to do is head to Start > Settings > Windows Update, and install it when it appears.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, if your PC is stuck in Windows RE, it's a bit trickier to solve. As Tom's Hardware explains, Microsoft recommends users to use their touchscreens or PS/2 ports if available. If not, you may need to rely on a USB recovery drive to get your PC back up and running.  Windows is experiencing other issues, tooWindows is going through it this month. This same October update also broke localhost functionality, which impacted any apps that connect to services running locally on your PC. (Luckily, Microsoft did issue a fix for that bug.) Then, last week, the company also officially ended support for Windows 10, and though it still offers Extended Security Updates for any user that wants to enroll their PC in the program, it puts the security of roughly half a billion PC users into question.   This Windows RE bug is just one more critical issue PC users have to deal with. Hopefully, Microsoft's next Windows 11 build introduces only fixes, and no additional bugs.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I don’t care whether you celebrate with a drunken costume party, pumpkin carving, door-to-door candy begging, or a more personal observance like watching horror movies alone, but respect must be paid to the awesomest of all holidays. But where did Halloween come from, and how did it end up like the modern holiday we now celebrate?The origins of Halloween are surprisingly slippery. Oct. 31 is next door to a Christian religious holiday, and it's  around \"harvest time,\" which might generally explain the date, but no one really knows why we put on costumes and beg for candy. There are a ton of theories describing how modern Halloween practices could have sprung from various ancient traditions, religious rites, or folk practices, but the first direct evidence of anything resembling modern \"Halloween\" is no older than the 1800s, and even then, it didn't really take off for another 100 years. Put succinctly, the history of Halloween as we know it is a muddy, confusing collection of practices that probably owe more to Peanuts comics published in the 1950s than Medieval Catholicism or pagan rites.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe theoretical history of HalloweenThe most commonly repeated Halloween origin story says that the holiday began with the Samhain (pronounced sah-win or sow-in) celebrations of the Celts in Ireland, England, and Northern France. The date of Nov. 1 or Oct. 31 is about halfway between the autumnal equinox and winter solstice, and ninth century Irish literature describes gatherings and feasts marking Samhain, the day when ancient burial mounds were opened, and with them, portals to the Otherworld, the land of the Gods and the dead. Later, the theory goes, these practices were Christianized, renamed “All Hallow’s Day” and “All Hallow’s Eve” by the early Church, and that’s where we get Halloween. Sounds plausible enough......but it's probably not what happened. The idea that Halloween comes from pagan rituals usurped by Christians originated with Welsh scholar Sir John Rhŷs, and he didn’t back up his theory with a ton of evidence. Some modern historians maintain that ties between Celtic celebrations and early Christian practices are tenuous, and medieval Christian festivals provide the real blueprint for the holiday. Medieval Christians celebrated All Saints' and All Souls days during the observance of Allhallowtide—the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead—by holding community feasts, emphasizing dead souls, and decorating skeletons. But they didn't get that from the Celts, or so the theory goes.Either way, both All Souls Day and Samhain likely have roots that go deeper than written history records. Harvest festivals were common in many places, and maybe they were like Halloween parties, but maybe they weren't. We don't know. The holiday takes place at the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time between life and death, when both Pagan and Christian minds turn toward the inevitable end of things. Halloween traditions seem to pay homage to that \"between\" place, and while we don't know how much about how ancients celebrated \"halfway between solstice and equinox day,\" it probably wasn't by dressing up and begging for treats. Verified Halloween historyNo matter where it started, by 835 AD, All Saints Day (Nov. 1) became an official Catholic day of obligation, and Allhallowtide practices like ringing church bells for souls in purgatory and black-clad criers taking to the streets to remind people to think of the dead are a little Halloween-like. If you squint.Another tradition of the time was baking “soul cakes” in memory of the dead. This led to “souling,” where groups of children traveled from house to house asking for cakes in exchange for praying for the dead. Later soulers would carry carved lanterns made of hollowed-out turnips too. Is this the origin of “trick or treating” and Jack o’ Lanterns? Maybe...but again, probably not. It doesn’t seem like souling children wore costumes, even though “guising” or “mumming” (dressing in costumes and bothering your neighbors for treats and/or money) was practiced in various places in Europe during other holidays, particularly around Christmas.Another theory for the origin of costumes for Halloween originates with the Late Medieval French tradition of the Danse Macabre—the dance of death. Perhaps in response to the Black Plague ravaging Europe, 14th century artists would depict the personification of Death surrounded by figures of a pope, an emperor, a king, a child, and a laborer—people from all levels of society—dancing toward the grave. Live versions of the Danse Macabre were enacted at village pageants, no doubt to the delight and horror of all. The grotesque but comical performance reminded people that Death would come for everyone, but also that we should have as much fun as possible before the inevitable, and there’s nothing more “Halloween” than that. But again, this is only a theory. The origins of Halloween in AmericaIn colonial America, Halloween was not widely observed. While New England Puritans generally frowned on anything fun like wearing costumes, dancing with Death, or carving pumpkins, more liberal colonists in New York, Maryland, and further south may have brought some Halloween-like activities over the ocean from their villages in Germany or Ireland. We don't really know, but other than for a few pockets of diehards, maybe, celebrating Halloween wasn't a thing in either the U.S. or Europe before the late 1800s.The earliest American expression of Halloween-like activities performed in late October or early November came in the form of “play parties,” or Autumn festivals, to celebrate the harvest. These gatherings, immortalized in Washington Irving's horror tale The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, often included ghost stories, attempts at divination, apple bobbing, pranks, and attempts to scare people—proto-Halloween activities, where you can see the holiday taking shape. It wasn’t until the Irish mass immigration of the 19th century that we see Halloween celebrations labeled as such. Beginning around the 1850s, Irish immigrants fleeing the Potato Famine descended on the country. These immigrants brought Halloween celebrations to the U.S., but it doesn’t seem like they brought Halloween costumes or trick-or-treating. The possible origins of trick-or-treatingAll of our modern ideas that Halloween traditions came from this or that ancient practice could be examples of cherry-picking data to support the conclusion that our modern Halloween traditions have a deep lineage in the first place. But what if they don't? Trick-or-treating is the most well-known expression of Halloween, but, despite historic examples of costume-clad holiday revelers and/or people going to door to door to beg for treats on holidays, there doesn't seem to be a direct link between any these older practices and modern trick or treating. Yes, it's a little like souling, but no one in America seems to have ever practiced souling. There's no evidence of anyone wearing costumes for Halloween in the U.S., the U.K., or Ireland before 1900 either, leading some Halloween scholars to suggest that American children developed trick-or-treating and costume-wearing independently of any older tradition. Which is actually the coolest theory: American kids made up Halloween from scratch.The first mention of Halloween candy collection in costume comes from a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario in 1911, but the practice remained obscure enough that there’s no mention of anything like it in Ruth Edna Kelley's 1919 history of the holiday, The Book of Hallowe’en, and there are no trick-or-treaters depicted in any of the many Halloween postcards printed in the 1920s. The practice doesn’t seem to have been widespread until the late 1930s, when the first mentions of it appears in a national publication, and it didn’t really take off until the early '50s, when it appeared in a Peanuts comic strip and a Disney cartoon. From there, everything we call \"Halloween\" comes into focus: The ghosts, the parties, the scares, the candy, all evolving from comic strips, movies, candy company advertising campaigns, and regular folks who seem to really enjoy dressing up in costumes.Halloween: The people's holidayWe ultimately don’t know much about the origin of Halloween because its meaning, and how we celebrate it, change constantly—it used to be a day for parties celebrating the harvest, during which people would read each other's fortunes; then it became a day for kids to go trick or treating; then adults started using it as an excuse to dress in sexy Martha Washington costumes and get drunk. Parents got a freaked about razorblades in candy and invent \"trunk-or-treating;\" overly ambitious suburbanites started turning their homes into elaborate spook-houses; and on and on. No ancient pagan ritual needed, just folks figuring out what works for them. Many other major holidays are rooted in religion or meant to commemorate a specific historical event—they’re top-down holidays, where the Pope or the government decreed that everyone would get a day off on this specific date, and observe it in this specific way. But Halloween is the people's holiday, so there's no official list of rules telling us how we're supposed to commemorate it, or even any reason why we should be celebrating it. But every year we do anyway, perhaps due to a collective desire to get some candy or do something witchy before it gets too cold to go outside. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Put simply, your brain needs regular periods of downtime to maintain peak operation. After periods of intense work, taking a brief break doesn’t just improve your mood—it can  actually boost your concentration and performance. So if you want to be truly productive, you should schedule those rest periods into your busy day.The case for scheduling your \"brain breaks\"It’s one thing to know you need downtime, but another to actually find time for it in your day. Through the course of a busy schedule—working, cleaning, studying, taking care of kids, driving, and doing all the other things on your to-do list—you might have the best of intentions when it comes to taking breaks, but not actually do it in the moment. That’s why you should schedule them.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn one episode of HBO's Succession, the character Shiv Roy actually set aside a block of time on her calendar for crying. You might not need to cry, but Shiv’s got the right idea: Open the calendar on your phone and add in blocks of personal time throughout your day, however you might spend it. Maybe you like to scroll TikTok, look at recipes, work on your creative projects, close your eyes for a moment, or call a friend. Whatever you’d like to do, prioritize it seriously by building the space for it into your schedule. If you use a shared calendar at work or home, block it out so everyone can see. You don’t need to publicly state what it’s for; you’ll know. And you won’t be letting your colleagues or family down since you’ll be even more productive when it’s over.Most importantly, stick to it. Even 15 minutes per day can be beneficial, but not if you don’t adhere to your plan. Being serious about taking time for yourself will help you build the habit and give you something to look forward to when working gets hard, so treat it like an important step in your workday.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to time your breaks for maximum productivityThere are a few approaches you can take to ensure your downtime proves to be effective. First, you should be time blocking and time boxing. These similar but distinct techniques involve not only determining exactly how much time you'll need for a given task, but using a calendar or planner to mark it all down. Using something like Google Calendar or even a physical planner, you'll account for every second of your day, so the entire column is filled up with back-to-back entries—but not all of those entries will be for work. Here is your chance to slot in something enjoyable, like a 2 p.m. matcha run or an episode of SVU at 8 p.m. You'll feel better about scheduling downtime if you're doing it alongside the designation of work tasks, and if you can see it all concretely represented in one place. Second, use the Pomodoro method. This famous productivity hack calls on you to work for 25 minutes, take a five-minute break, work another 25, break again, and repeat the cycle four times before taking a longer break. Building in smaller breaks this way might make the exercise more palatable if you are struggling to justify off-time. Plus, Pomodoro is more flexible than it seems at first, and a lot of variations exist. Take animedoro, for instance: you work for 40 to 60 minutes with a 20-minute break, about the length of an episode of anime. You don't need to watch anime, of course, nor be so rigid with your timing: The important part is being conscientious about interspersing your work sessions with small breaks. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The TV app, for instance, no longer automatically rewinds or fast forwards when you press back or forward, instead navigating between buttons including \"like\" or \"subscribe.\" More than once while on TV, I've accidentally subscribed to a channel without meaning to, before realizing that I now need to press up first to get to the progress bar.Now, the changes have reached the YouTube mobile app, as first spotted by 9to5Google. While they're a bit more mild than you'll see on TV, there's still a few changes to get used to.Bigger, chunkier icons\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nBy far, the most noticeable new change is YouTube's new suite of icons, which all look like they've been hit with a \"Ctrl + B.\" Compared to the old look, the play, fast forward, and other buttons all look larger and bolder, with the idea being to make them more prominent.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSome of the buttons have also been consolidated. When watching a video in landscape, buttons that don't affect playback (like, dislike, comment, etc.) all now appear together in a pill in the bottom-left corner, rather than as separate elements.New animationsNew buttons aren't the only change YouTube has in store for you. Seeking videos also has a new animation now, and on some videos, liking now comes with a bit of extra personality.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe first is a pretty minor change. Now, when you double tap the screen to either go forward or back 10 seconds, the video will just automatically jump to the new spot and display a big \"-10\" or \"+10,\" rather than showing a quick animation of three arrows disappearing into each other with a smaller \"-10 seconds\" or \"+10 seconds\" below them.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe second is a bit cuter. On certain videos, tapping the \"like\" button will now play a custom animation, rather than simply putting some sparkles around a thumbs up. For instance, on a music video, you'll now briefly see a musical note replacing the thumbs up.Pausing no longer darkens your backgroundIt used to be that pausing a video would darken the background until you unpaused it, kind of like lights being lowered on a stage. That's no longer the case. While you'll still see the lights go slightly down while you have controls open, a paused video will now display as normal if you tap again to dismiss the controls. It's a small tweak, but could prove useful for taking screenshots. At the same time, though, I do worry that it might make it easy to think a video has frozen, if you're not paying attention.Nested comments and easier bookmarksFinally, Google has removed a few steps to saving and commenting on videos. Now, hitting the bookmark icon to save a video to a playlist has fewer steps, no longer requiring you to navigate multiple pages. Instead, it'll just pause the video and open a list of your playlists for you, where you can quickly tap the playlist you want to save your video to.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nAdditionally, comments are threaded now, easily showing who is replying to which comment. It's a great way to keep track of the flow of the conversation, although it does make each comment take up a bit of extra space.Can you get rid of the new YouTube UI?Ultimately, I'm a little torn on the new YouTube app. Certain new features, like threaded comments, just make sense to me. But the chunkier buttons do feel like they get in the way a bit to me, and I can't help but think of Fisher-Price when I see them.Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do if you don't like the new YouTube mobile interface. It's still rolling out, so it's possible you might not see every change yet. But because it's server-side, once it hits you, that's it. Even the web player is getting these changes, so leaving the app behind isn't a viable option.That said, if you're on desktop, users on both Reddit and YouTube itself are putting together extension lists that you can mix and match to customize your experience. Technically, there are browsers for mobile that will allow you to play with these as well, with Firefox being the big one these days. However, I found that most of the suggested extensions no longer worked for me or weren't available for mobile. In that case, if you're sick of how YouTube looks now, you might want to consider an alternate player app instead, like Play. It still relies on embedded videos, so it won't save you from every change, but its overall minimalist style could offer welcome relief from YouTube's increasingly busy design language.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

According to these users, their iPhones have changed color over the short period of time they've owned them. Obviously, the internet has dubbed the issue \"colorgate.\" Apple is no stranger to \"gates,\" of course, especially when it comes to the iPhone: There was \"antennagate,\" when the iPhone 4's redesigned antennas reported caused cellular connection issues; \"bendgate,\" when the iPhone 6 Plus was prone to physically bending; and most recently, \"scratchgate,\" where the aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro Max appeared susceptible to scratching easily.Now, colorgate is here to further draw criticism to the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. Customers such as DakAttack316 on Reddit are claiming their Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pros are turning pink—or, if you want to give it an \"Apple label,\" rose gold. It's tough not to see the reason this would bother people: Apple's advertisements for the Cosmic Orange iPhones highlight a vibrant and striking orange. The iPhone in the photos from DakAttack316 looks more sunburnt than anything else. The wireless charging pad remains a somewhat bright orange, but the aluminum has taken on a salmon hue. The orange accents throughout the phone also seem to have been affected, with some looking faded or dirty. Maybe if the entire iPhone was all one pinkish hue, it wouldn't look so bad, but the variety of colors visible in the photo make it look damaged.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDakAttack316's might be among the most viral accounts of the issue, but they aren't alone. Take this post for instance: The issue isn't quite as pronounced, but you can clearly see how faded the orange metal is, especially when directly compared to another Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro Max. Meanwhile, this viral TikTok shows some more selective discoloration on different elements of an iPhone 17 Pro. \nIt's not clear what is causing these issues, or how many Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pros are affected. Some theories suggest that using the wrong type of solvent to clean your iPhone, such as bleach or hydrogen peroxide, could be causing or contributing to the discoloration, since Apple says these chemicals shouldn't be used on iPhones. (Even if that isn't the case, it's always good practice to abstain from treating your devices with cleaning solutions unless the manufacturer has officially approved those chemicals.)Should people stop buying the iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange?No. We don't know why this is happening yet, or how widespread the issue is, but if a statistically significant number of Cosmic Orange iPhones were having this issue, you'd likely be seeing a lot more complaints than you are at the moment—especially considering the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are selling better than expected.Maybe these users were treating their iPhones with harsh chemical cleaners; perhaps a small number of Cosmic Orange iPhones have a manufacturing defect. Whatever the cause turns out to be, it doesn't appear to be something afflicting the majority of the devices. Compare these two Reddit posts showing off pink Cosmic Orange iPhones, with this thread of users who are happy with their color choice. It's all anecdotal evidence, of course, but for the moment, I'm just not seeing very many users complaining about sunburnt iPhones.If you do buy a Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro, and it does turn pink, take it to Apple or your carrier. So long as you didn't clean it with bleach, the company will almost assuredly swap it out for you—hopefully for a device that won't fade with age.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

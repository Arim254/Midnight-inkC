Such is the case with a recent spate of unprompted texts purporting to be from the crypto wallet service Coinbase. If you receive such a message, even if you have a Coinbase account, delete it. Someone is likely trying to scam you. Coinbase isn't texting you Here's how the scam works: You receive an unsolicited text message that reads \"Your Coinbase withdrawal code is...\" followed by a six-digit number. The message continues: \"Please do not share this code with anyone. If you have no requested this, please call:\" followed by a phone number and a reference number. On the surface, this seems like a fairly standard two-factor authentication (2FA) code. Most companies include a similar warning in their messages when sending along your code, as hackers really want you to give them those digits. In many cases, a 2FA code the only thing standing between them and your account, so companies want to ensure you don't hand yours over to someone else.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nUnfortunately, this text is an example of the opposite: a scammer impersonating the language of a legitimate company in order to gain your trust. The hope on the scammer's part is that you receive this text and assume that it's real, but worry, because you know you didn't request a 2FA code. Since you now trust that the message really is from Coinbase, you might turn to the contact number conveniently included with the message to follow up. Hey, they've even attached a reference number, so the \"Coinbase rep\" you talk to can track your issue. How considerate. In reality, this is one big scam. If you called the number, the scammer will likely continue the charade, perhaps by assuring you that they'll help secure your account. My guess is that the scammer would ask you to \"verify\" your Coinbase login credentials, which they would enter on their end, triggering the legitimate 2FA process. Once you receive that code, the scammer might ask you to tell them what it is as part of verification process. But once they have that code, they can log into your account for real, change the password, and lock you out. Bye bye crypto. If you're a Coinbase user, this definitely seems concerning, but don't worry too much: I've been getting these scam texts myself, and I don't have a Coinbase account. While scammers might be targeting Coinbase users who have had their information leaked in data breaches, it's more likely they're simply sending these scam texts to leaked phone numbers en masse. They'll likely snag some anxious Coinbase users in their net, but I'm sure they'd happy \"chat with\" anyone who doesn't have a Coinbase account who happens to call, too. \"Oh, you don't have a Coinbase account? No problem, we'll get this cleared up for you. Can you just confirm your Social Security number for us, so we can make sure you're really not in our system?\"What to do when you get a suspicious textsIt can be tempting to respond to these texts once you know they are scams, especially when the goal is to simply waste the scammer's time. But as fun as that can be, my advice is to ignore these texts whenever you receive them. While the immediate risks are diminished once you know the \"rep\" is really malicious, responding to these texts lets the scammer know your number is active, and, in response, they might file it away for a future scam attempt. Scammers can also be clever. If you're not careful, you might give away more information than you realize while you're \"messing\" with them. Part of a phishing scheme is establishing a rapport: The scammer wants to lull you into a false sense of security so you give them personal details that might help them steal your info or break into accounts.  The best thing you can do is to delete these texts whenever you receive them. If your messaging app of choice gives you the option to report the text as spam, all the better.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

What are you putting all this time and effort (and money) into if it's not preparation for the future? One way you can do that is by using “elaborative interrogation,” a technique that helps you learn more effectively by challenging the facts you’re going over. Even if you do only want to pass a test, this can help you understand how the material's concepts relate to one another, which can help you remember them better ahead of exam day.What is elaborative interrogation?Inquiry is an important part of learning, which is why it’s fundamental to some of the best study methods, like SQ3R and KWL. Using those techniques, you outline what you may already know before you start studying, take a quick scan of the material to formulate questions that can guide your reading, then answer your own questions as you go. They're great techniques for making sure you stay engaged and curious, both of which help you focus and actually learn.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith inquiry in general, not only do you have to memorize what’s presented to you, but you have to dig in and understand it by asking questions. Like I said, when employing SQ3R or KWL, you ask questions before you start reading, so you can find the answers. When you try elaborative interrogation, you ask the questions as you go.Asking questions helps you find answers and establish connections that aren’t immediately apparent in the text, letting you more thoroughly understand what you’re going over. This concept makes sense: When your friend is telling you a wild story, you ask follow-up questions, right? When you ask questions, you're automatically more involved in the process of receiving information and you remember what you take in better because you're getting answers to the parts you were curious about.How to study with elaborative interrogationTo make this work for you, you need to assess the facts of your material. Say you’re studying accounting. One fact you’ll learn is that you journalize debits before credits. You can get by and do well enough on tests just by knowing that fact without thinking any deeper about it—but if you really want to understand the material, it would be helpful to figure out why you journalize debits before credits. When doing elaborative interrogation, you ask yourself these kinds of questions after looking at your facts, so you fully grasp the meaning of it all. Here, your elaborative interrogation is, “Why do we journalize debits before we journalize credits?” Your next question can be, “Why do we record debits as a positive number?” The reason it’s done this way is to reflect incoming money more easily on the credit side.You can even go deeper by working backwards: Why do accountants journalize? What do accountants journalize? Who sees the accountant's journal? What is included in an accountant's journal entry? What are debits? What are credits? Why are they journalized? When are they journalized? The more you understand about the core concept, the more questions you can ask, and the more you can grasp the primary fact, which is that you journalize debits before credits. Eventually, the reasoning for why debits are journalized before credits will be so obvious that the fact itself will be more than obvious. Of course that's the order you do it in, and if that order is all you need to know for your test, you're golden. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo, start by identifying the basic facts you need to know. You can do this easily by writing them down as you go through your text, notes, or lecture. Any assertion or basic fact makes the cut. You can also try using AI, like Google's NotebookLM or ChatGPT, to generate facts. As a test, I just asked ChatGPT, “What are some basic facts to study for accounting?” It gave me 16, almost all of which are great for elaborative interrogation. For instance, the software told me that the International Financial Reporting Standards are used in many countries for financial reporting. That’s probably an answer to a question on a test on its own, but to really understand the point of it all, I could ask, “Why do countries need a set of accounting standards? Which countries use the IFRS?” If you're using ChatGPT or similar, just make sure it’s giving you actual facts; look them up to be sure they’re true. Better yet, use the other tool I mentioned, NotebookLM, because it pulls only from material you provide. Upload your course materials—slide decks, chapter scans, handouts from the professor, whatever—and ask it to pull out the key facts. You can also use the software to generate flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and informational podcasts, but those are for different study approaches entirely. (Try them out when you're done elaborately interrogating!)On a separate paper, write down these questions about your facts, then set to work investigating the answers. The answers may come from materials outside your class lecture, notes, or texts, so don’t be afraid to dig deep. For the most part, though, do try to stick with what you've been provided unless the professor has instructed you to look elsewhere on your own. Ultimately, getting the answers to these questions will help you establish the  connections you need to truly grasp the material and remember it well. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

According to a recent post on the website formerly known as Twitter, the company will soon start selling “handles that are no longer in use” to paying subscribers.The feature, called the X Handle Marketplace, is currently only being teased, but a waitlist for it is live. Once active, it’ll allow X Premium+ subscribers (at the $40/month level) and Premium Business accounts to both request free (with their subscription, at least) handles, and directly purchase especially rare ones.Rare usernames could cost $2,500 or moreAccording to an FAQ page, pricing for rare handles starts at $2,500 and could go “over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.” You’ll also need an invitation to even be allowed to purchase a paid username, although receiving the complimentary handles also comes with complications.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFor free handles, there are two types. The standard ones, called “priority handles,” are open for any eligible subscriber to request; X says it will usually review requests within three business days, although not all requests will be approved. But X also says it will occasionally drop select rare handles (the type it would usually charge for) as part of free giveaways, where multiple subscribers can apply for the handle and a winner will be selected “based on merit.”As for what X considers “merit” to be, that would include past contributions to the site, intended usage for the handle, as well as engagement and reach on the platform.Once you’ve got a new handle, your current username will be locked so others won’t be able to change it, and your page’s @ will change to the new one. X also says it may offer paid redirects from old usernames to new ones in the future.Note, though, that if you got your new handle for free, you’ll need to stay subscribed to keep using it. Users who paid for their handles will be able to let their X subscriptions lapse without losing them.What handles X will be giving out for freeAs for what type of inactivate handles X will be giving out, the site has provided a few examples. Generally, paid handles will be pithy, one word, “culturally significant names,” like @Pizza or @Tom. Meanwhile, free ones are more likely to be full names or multi-word phrases, like @GabrielJones or @PizzaEater. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs someone who doesn’t subscribe to X, it’s the full names that have me concerned—and the ones I’d suggest logging into your account to preserve. Part of the reason I haven’t deactivated my X account yet is because I don’t want someone else to be able to make an account with my username, which is a variation on my full given name. I don’t post on it very often, but I’d rather others not be able to easily masquerade as me.With that in mind, I’ve reached out to X to ask how the website will decide when to make “inactive” usernames available to request, and will update this post when I hear back. X’s inactive account policy says that users should log in “at least every 30 days” to keep their accounts active, though, so if you’re concerned about your username being taken, it’s best to play it safe.To be fair to X, redistributing usernames from inactive accounts is not an unheard of practice for social media sites, although charging for them is a bit novel. X says the reason it’s requiring a subscription to access the X Handle Marketplace is “to prevent bot spam or misuse,” so that the site can make way for “fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”However, as hinted at by another change coming to the site, a subscribed account does not necessarily mean a bot-free account. I’m curious to see how the X Handle Marketplace launch goes once the feature hits the (paying) public.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.There are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.OpenAI's new Sora app has been the main focus concerning hyper-realistic AI slop over the past few weeks. Sora makes it all too easy for users to generate short-form videos that seem real enough to most people, including videos that showcase real people's likenesses.But before Sora dropped, it was Google that was stirring fears about these realistic AI videos. With Veo 3, Google launched an AI model that not only produced lifelike videos, it also generated realistic audio synced to the action. Sound effects, environments, even dialog could all generate alongside the video itself, selling the effect entirely from one simple prompt. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nVeo 3.1Now, Google is back with an upgrade to Veo, appropriately named Veo 3.1, which the company announced in a blog post on Wednesday. This isn't necessarily an overhaul or a revolutionary new video model. Instead, Veo 3.1 builds on top of Veo 3, adding \"richer audio\" and \"enhanced realism\" that Google says generates \"true-to-life\" textures. The new model also reportedly supports new narrative controls tools, which pairs with new upgrades to Flow, Google's AI video editor. Flow users now have more granular controls when editing, and can add audio to existing features like \"Ingredients to Video,\" \"Frames to Video,\" and \"Extend.\" What does that mean in practice? According to Google, Ingredients to Video with Veo 3.1 lets users add references images to their scenes, such as a specific person, clothing items, or an environment. The new Flow editor can then insert those elements into the finished product, as you can see in the demo video below: \nBuilding off of this new feature, Flow now lets you add new elements to an existing scene as well. With \"Insert,\" you can tell Veo 3.1 to add new characters, details, lighting effects, and more to the clip. Google says it is also working on the opposite as well, to allow users to remove any elements they don't like from a generation.\nGoogle also now has a new way for users to dictate how they'd like a scene to generate, called \"First and last frame.\" Users can choose reference frames for the beginning and ending of a scene. Flow with Veo 3.1 will then fill in the gap, and generate a scene that starts and ends based on those images. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's also now a way to create videos that are longer than previous iterations of Flow would generate. The new \"Extend\" feature lets you either continue the action of the current clip, or cut to a new scene that follows it, though Google says the feature is most useful for generating a longer establishing shot. According to the company, Extend can create videos that last over a minute.\nVeo 3.1 is available for users in the Gemini app as well as Vertex AI, as long as you have a Google AI Pro subscription. Developers can access it via the Gemini API. Google says Ingredients to Video, First and last frame, and Extend are coming to Gemini API, but \"Add object\" and \"Remove object\" are not available. \"Extend\" is also not yet available in the Vertex AI API. Is this really a good thing?Google sees all of these advancements as a boon for creatives and creativity, but I'm highly skeptical. I could see Veo 3.1 and Flow as a good tool for envisioning shots before filming or animating them (i.e. a storyboarding tool), or even a way for new and budding filmmakers to learn editing by seeing their ideas in a more realized form. However, as a whole, I don't think AI-generated content is the future—or, at least, not a future most of us want. Sure, there's humor or novelty in some of these AI-generated videos, but I'd wager most of the people who enjoy them do so ironically, or exclusively to social media. The idea of replacing human filmmakers and actors with AI generations seems absurd, especially when it puts all of us at risk of disinformation. Is it really so important for companies like Google and OpenAI to make it easy to generate hyper-realistic fully-rendered scenes, when those videos could so easily be used to trick the masses? This could be the ramblings of someone resistant to change, but I don't think most of us would like to see our favorite shows and movies made with passion and emotion, replaced by realistic-looking people delivering muted and robotic performances.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. A number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources.

Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.And then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Spotify is doing its best to fix at least one of those problems, by testing AI recaps for some of its audiobooks.It's the first new AI-powered feature in a while that I would actually use. In fact, I've played a few video games with similar features (not powered by AI, admittedly), and it's always such a value-add that it makes me pine for it in pretty much every other piece of media I engage with.Here's how Spotify's new feature works: First, you unfortunately do need to be using the Spotify app for iOS, so Android, web, or desktop listeners are out of luck, at least during this beta test. Then, you'll need to have listened to a supported English language audiobook for at least 15-20 minutes. After that, you'll see a Recap button at the top of the page that will quickly generate a one- to two-minute-long summary of what's happened in the book so far, which Spotify promises will be spoiler-free for future plot events. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nPreviously on [your book]Spotify's likening it to a \"previously on\" segment on a TV show, although it also says that, \"Recaps do not replicate narration or replace the original audiobook in any way,\" so don't expect to hear actual clips from the book, nor an AI voice trying to mimic the narrator. However, just as TV's \"previously on\" segments will change with new episodes, your AI Recap will be \"regularly updated to match your progress.\"As for any potential issues with the feature, the company says it is \"not using audiobook content for LLM training purposes or voice generation\" and that authors can opt out of having Recaps on their books. Still, there are a few caveats, including the fact that the Recap feature isn't free.On the plus side, it is included alongside the free audiobook hours you get with Spotify Premium, as well as any add-on hours you might buy. But otherwise, audiobooks on Spotify need to be bought on a per-book basis, so for users without Spotify Premium and with no audiobooks in their libraries (that's me), there's no way to try AI Recaps before you buy, which means it's maybe not a convincing reason to swap audiobook platforms just yet.Not all books will get RecapsSpotify's also not being upfront about which books have Recaps, so it could be a bit before you see the button pop up for you. So while I like the idea in theory, I'm probably not going to get to test it anytime soon. (I've reached out to Spotify to ask for a current list of books with Recaps enabled, and will update this article when I hear back.)Could Recaps include hallucinations?Another potential issue with these Recaps: hallucinations. Spotify didn't address accuracy at all in its announcement, which I'd like to think implies the company is feeling pretty confident it won't be an issue. But there is still a potential for an AI to misreport specific details of your story, or accidentally slip a spoiler in regardless of what Spotify claims. One would hope your memory would be jogged enough by a general outline to catch inconsistencies, but still, it might be worth keeping a few notes while you read, just in case.How to get AI summaries for any book (without using Spotify)If you aren't a Spotify audiobook listener or just haven't gotten to try the beta, I'll give you a cheat: You can already ask other AI chatbots for book summaries for free. So long as you remember where you left off, just head over to your AI of choice and ask for a summary up to that point.

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.If I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Before the likes of TikTok and Instagram Reels, online video content was more long-form than not. It might have felt short by the standards of cable TV, but many of the videos  on platforms like YouTube were regularly anywhere from two to 10 minutes, if not longer. The first platform to really popularize short-form content as we think of it now was Vine. These videos were short—a maximum of six seconds at a time, which should have spelled the platform's doom. Who would want to watch these tiny videos back to back for hours at a time? A lot of us, apparently. Vine compilations garner millions (if not tens of millions) of views on YouTube. While the Twitter-owned platform only lasted about five years, it established itself as a true cultural phenomenon. Quote the first half of a popular vine to a group of young millennials or Gen Zs, and, chances are, they'll finish the line. For years, us Vine fans have longed for someone to bring the app back. Sure, short-form video has never been more addicting, but it's just not the same. Videos on Vine had a much different feel than most of the content you see on TikTok. Maybe it was the limited runtime; maybe it was the stripped-down recording interface. But to me, Vine feels like early YouTube: homemade, indie, and fun.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDivine is the new VineIt seems that experience might actually be making a comeback. A new app, Divine, is trying to recreate the magic of those six-second loops. Divine, built by former Twitter employee Evan Henshaw-Plath and funded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is meant to be a platform to share vines old and new. Of course, you can upload fresh six-second clips, but the app will also feature 150,000 to 200,000 \"archived\" vines from roughly 60,000 creators. You won't have to rely on those Vine compilations anymore—you can watch those classic clips directly on Divine. Those videos aren't scraped from YouTube compilations, either. According to TechCrunch, Vine's original library was stored by the organization \"Archive Team\" in a huge but largely inaccessible archive. Henshaw-Plath studied the library, extracting as much data as possible to build profiles for the original Vine accounts and display metrics like views and original comments. Though not all Vines were archived, including \"millions of K-pop-focused videos,\" Henshaw-Plath believes \"a good percentage\" are available on Divine. Vine creators can choose to either take down their videos from Divine or take over their profiles on the app, so long as they prove their identities. Divine is also a decentralized social media platform running on the Nostr protocol. That means no one company owns it, which means your content is your content. When you post, your videos are tied to you via private keys, so you can always prove ownership. Plus, there are no user-specific algorithms. You have to choose what you want to watch, or jump into an algorithm created by the Divine community. My favorite part of this experiment, however? No AI. At a time when  other social media platforms are inundated with hyperrealistic videos from generators like Sora, Divine has a strict no-AI policy. Divine uses tech from the Guardian Project to confirm whether a video was filmed on a smartphone. If the system detects a video is artificial, it gets taken down. It's enough to make this tech editor shed a (joyful) tear. How to join DivineAs you might expect, there's a lot of demand to try Divine at launch. At this time, the company says its beta test is full. However, you can sign up for the waitlist to be notified when more spots open up. You can also browse clips on the platform's web app right now, even without an account, but I've found it to be a bit glitchy.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The new feature is powered by Google's \"Shopping Graph,\" a list of 50 billion products that also informs Google's Shopping tab, and it's available to everyone on both desktop and mobile starting today.Here's how it works: In Google search's AI Mode or the Gemini app/website, you can ask a question or send a prompt about a physical product, like \"Help me find an espresso maker that has a steam wand, is affordable, and is good for beginners.\" If the AI can find relevant product information in the Shopping Graph, it'll then give you a short writeup and pop up a few product suggestions along with shopping information, like pricing and user reviews. Clicking on any of these tiles will then open a sidebar with sites where you can purchase the item.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nEssentially, it's like using Google's Shopping tab, but with a virtual shopping assistant (or, let's be real, a salesperson) you can turn to for more context about what you're seeing. Some queries will even let you click a checkbox on their product tiles so you can mark off to ask follow-up questions. For instance, you could check off two product tiles and ask the AI to compare them, or ask which is cheaper or has better reviews.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccording to Google representatives at a press event, the company is hoping this will make it easier for shoppers to buy gifts for friends or relatives that are traditionally hard to shop for, and that it will make shopping easier by letting people search using natural language.My hands-on experienceWhen I tested out this new tool, it generally worked out, but I did encounter a few hiccups. The biggest was that it was hard to get the AI to recognize certain products as topics it could surface tiles for. For instance, asking for \"Popular Nintendo Switch games under $60\" just gave me a list of games, but no links to purchase them. I assume this is because the AI thought I was simply asking for general advice about what to play instead of shopping, but no amount of rewording would prompt the tool to show me product tiles, even when I explicitly asked for them.I also ran into problems when it came to natural language searches. At the aforementioned press event, Google gave journalists example questions to ask the AI in order to try the new feature, but I found only the questions that called out specific types of products would give me tiles to click on. For instance, a question like \"Give me Christmas gift ideas for my sister who loves knitting and reading\" wouldn't trigger the new feature, but \"show me ottomans that can be used as coffee tables\" would. Even the example Google used in its blog announcing the feature wouldn't work for me—asking for Christmas gift ideas for a college student who likes to run gave me generic answers like \"running shoes\" and \"moisture-wicking socks,\" but didn't show any specific examples that I could buy.That shouldn't stop you from getting gift ideas from the AI, but it does mean that when you're ready to buy, you'll want to ask a fresh question that asks for a specific type of product, rather than ideas for a specific person. It's a bit of an extra step for something that's supposed to take the guesswork out of the buying process.With those caveats in place, I still see most users still sticking to the regular shopping tab, where they can be sure they'll get product links every time. But Google's hoping that integrating shopping into AI Mode will eventually give users the best of both worlds, allowing them to make more specific searches than they could without AI, and also allowing the AI to call on training data the shopping tab doesn't have access to, like Reddit posts and website reviews.Now I just need to find a way to convince my family that all my thoughtful gift ideas didn't just come from a robot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You won't get access to the Phone app's latest AI features, but if all you want is a reliable way to record phone calls, you'll be set. Google announced this new rollout back in September, calling the ability to record calls a \"fundamentally useful feature,\" even without transcription or automatic note taking. That's certainly true: While the idea of recording phone calls might strike some as nefarious, there are many legitimate applications for recording phone calls, from journalists seeking a record of an phone interview, to patients calling their healthcare providers to make sure they keep track of all medical advice and instruction. Call recording on Android—especially on Google's Pixel devices—has had a turbulent past. While there was once a time you could download a third-party call recorder app without issue, Google started slowly taking away key functions from developers, like blocking access to recordings from microphones. In 2022, the company announced that was blocking access to Android's Accessibility API, the main workaround developers used for their apps—effectively killing the third-party call recorder market. If your phone's manufacturer supported call recording in their primary app, that was still OK, but if not, you basically lost this functionality. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, Google offers a feature called Call Notes, which transcribes and summarizes your calls using Gemini. In addition to these AI enhancements, however, you still receive a recording of the phone call, making these two Pixel series the only ones with the capability. That's why this call recording expansion is so necessary.Call recording on Pixel isn't perfectThere are two key caveats to keep in mind with this feature, however. First, don't expect to record a call without the other party's permission. Even if you live in a region with one-party consent—meaning you don't need both parties to agree to the recording—Google's call recorder will announce that it is about to record the call. Unless the other party isn't paying attention, they will know you're recording—and could choose to hang up the line if they feel uncomfortable. Second, this feature won't be available to all Pixel users, even if you have the proper Pixel device. This feature will only work in regions where call recording is legal, and Google says it is rolling out the functionality to all countries that support it throughout the rest of this year. It seems as of this article, the United States and Canada have the feature, but many other countries do not. If you live somewhere where call recording is legal, but don't see this feature yet, sit tight: It's likely rolling out soon. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up call recording on PixelTo start, make sure you're using a Pixel 6 or newer, running at least Android 14, or a non-Pixel device running at least Android 9. Next, update your Phone app to the latest version.Now, open the Phone app's Settings, then head to Call Assist > Call Recording. Here, you can turn on the toggle next to \"Turn on Call Recording.\" You can also toggle on \"Automatically record calls with non-contacts,\" if you want the app to start recording whenever someone outside your contacts list calls, or \"Automatically record calls with these numbers\" to manually select contacts you'd like the Phone app to record conversations for. You can choose to automatically delete these recordings after seven, 14, or 30 days, or let them stay on your phone forever. You can skip those latter two options, however, if you'd rather make recordings a case-by-case basis. If so, whenever you're in a call, you can choose the Call Assist button to select \"Call Recording.\" (If this is your first recording, you'll need to download some audio files before you're able to record calls.) When you do, the Phone app will ask if you'd like to record the call, which you can agree to.

But that doesn’t mean it works perfectly for everyone. Like any other method, it’s adaptable and, once you get the hang of it, should be customized to meet your unique needs. And if you find that Pomodoro's 25-minute work sessions with five-minute cooldowns aren’t cutting it for you, there's a similar but more flexible alternative: flowtime.What is the flowtime technique?The flowtime technique is a spin on Pomodoro, and as such, relies on the same principles: You work for a while, then get a break. The difference is that you determine how long the work and rest time last. Sometimes referred to as “flowmodoro,” this method is also all about keeping you in the zone on a task, luring you into deep work by using the goal of taking a break to keep you going. The break is crucial, so no matter how long you work, you do have to take one. Not only is that the motivator to keep you focused, but your productivity will take a massive hit if you work too long. Flowtime—or any technique designed to help you accomplish deep work—is useless if you end up producing dreck. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe key here is the uninterrupted work you do while you’re gunning for that break. Like Pomodoro, you’re supposed to stay focused intently on a single task for the duration of your grind time, rather than do a little work, check your phone, type a little more, check your email, etc. Don't multitask, either, since it will actually make you less efficient. The only way flowtime is truly different from Pomodoro that you decide how long you work for, instead of relying on the \"25 on, five off\" framework. With Pomodoro, you are stricter, typically using a timer to keep you working and from checking your phone. You may not think you need the timer with the flowtime technique, but you should use one that has a stopwatch function to track how long you actually end up working and keep it on hand for days when you need the extra structure of the timer itself. In fact, once you finish a few days of flowtime and figure out your own working habits with the stopwatch, you'll need the timer so you can set it in personalized increments. This where I recommend using an app to help you manage things. My favorite is FocusPomo, which blocks your distracting apps for you whenever you're in a focus session. These sessions are customizable, so they don't have to be 25 minutes, and once you use it for a while, you get useful data on how long you work and when you may have gotten distracted.How to set up your personal flowtimeThe downside to using flowtime over Pomodoro is the same as the upside: You’re in charge of how long you work. While the Pomodoro technique is straightforward and outlines exactly how long you get to work and play, setting up your personal flowtime requires a little bit more effort and thought. You’ll need about a week to figure it out before you fully put it into action. During this exploratory setup period, here’s what you do:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTrack when you start working on a specific task with no distractions. You can use time-tracking software, but in this case a spreadsheet might be better because you also…Write down when you start feeling restless, distracted, or disinterested. Check your stopwatch to see exactly how long you were working, then take a break.Jot down when you feel energized enough to get back to the task and restart your stopwatch.Repeat until the task is done, then mark down when you finished, and how you feel overall.In a spreadsheet, dedicate one sheet to each task that needs to get done. Your columns can be labeled however makes sense to you, but something like the below—including a date, start and break times, and an ultimate conclusion time—is helpful. After using the spreadsheet for a while, you’ll get a sense of how long you can usually stand working on something before you need a break and how long those breaks typically need to be for you to feel rejuvenated enough to get back at it. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nOnce you have a sense of your own work abilities and preferences, you can put them into action. If you can usually focus on cleaning for 15 minutes, start setting your timer for 15 minutes every time you clean, then give yourself a break that works for you, whether it’s five or 10 minutes. Commit to getting back to the task. From personal experience, this part matters a lot. I can think of plenty of times when I did not commit to getting back to it, but I notice I feel significantly less motivated when that happens. Focus on those feelings of self-satisfaction, and use them to motivate you to get back at it.You can challenge yourself to add more time to your work sessions gradually, but that’s optional. If your specific method is working for you, great. If you want to get better at focusing for long periods of time, start by adding one minute every time you do a task, inching it from, say, 15 to 16 to 17 minutes every time. It’s helpful to go back to the spreadsheet if you plan to do this, so you can see if you’re starting to tap out too early and readjust your flowtime. Bear in mind that you need to run through that experimental period for every single kind of task. If you're working on an application for grad school and feel extremely motivated, the time might fly by, and you may discover you can work for an hour with no problem. If your house is a mess and you struggle to find cleaning motivation, you may not be able to do more than 15 or 20 minutes of that at a time. It wouldn't make sense to block out an hour for cleaning just because it's something else you can do for an hour—you're only setting yourself up to fail. Unfortunately, this means the preparation period for flowtime adoption is lengthy, but it is worth it.This isn’t an easy way out if Pomodoro doesn’t work for you. Rather, it’s a challenge to find a time combination that does work for you. Something is always better than nothing, so find the flowtime that fits your needs and tap into the power of uninterrupted work with the promise of breaks, even if it looks a little different from the norm. Don't get discouraged if you don't feel like you're working in long enough chunks at first; productivity falls off when you don't give yourself enough breaks, so look at this as a way of making sure that doesn't happen. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

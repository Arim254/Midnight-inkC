AI personal trainers sound like a perfect solution. Download an app, answer some questions about your goals and fitness level, and receive a personalized training program. I've tested some of these apps myself, and I definitely see the appeal. But more than anything, I see companies stuffing AI into apps where it doesn't belong. There's Strava's Athlete \"Intelligence\"; Garmin's underwhelming Connect+ subscription; Whoop's recovery recommendations, just to name a few. And as Lifehacker senior health editor Beth Skwarecki points out, people are increasingly asking ChatGPT for training advice, which is infuriating considering how many high-quality, free programs are already out there. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMedical professionals and trainers are increasingly noticing clients experiencing anxiety around optimization and performance, becoming discouraged when AI labels their efforts as inadequate. Think of how something like \"closing your rings\" on Apple Watch activity goals had a chokehold over the nation. Or Fitbit step counts, even when step goals are bullshit in the first place. When metrics don't align with expectations, people feel like failures. And it's not because they haven't made progress, but because an algorithm told them so. Blind trust and data obsessionCertified personal trainer Cara D'Orazio describes what she calls \"digital guilt\"—the anxiety that creeps in when you miss a workout notification or can't keep up with your app's demands. She recalls clients who arrived at her gym burnt out and demoralized, including one woman whose AI coach prescribed six consecutive training days without rest. The woman felt \"lazy\" for being sore—a natural physiological response her digital trainer couldn't recognize or validate.\"People begin relying so much on the algorithm that they lose connection with how their body actually feels,\" D'Orazio says. \"A real coach can tell when your stress levels are high, when you didn't sleep, or when you just need to talk for five minutes before starting. AI doesn't do that. It only sees numbers—calories, steps, heart rate—not emotions, hormones, or mindset.\" Movement should enhance your relationship with your body, not create anxiety around it. This disconnection is particularly dangerous when you consider how deeply intertwined your fitness can be with your mental health. Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness, has witnessed the psychological toll firsthand. \"I have definitely seen folks get discouraged and even anxious when they rely too heavily on AI fitness enhanced tools,\" he explains. \"While it is great that these apps can track everything, they are lacking a bit on the balance and self compassion side of fitness.\" I know that when I'm in a vulnerable mental state, this lack of empathy can be devastating. As D'Orazio warns, \"If we're not careful, we're going to see a whole new wave of people who are 'fit' on paper but emotionally exhausted and disconnected from their bodies.\" The constant performance feedback is a recipe for an unhealthy fixation on fitness goals.The human touch AI simply can't replaceOutside of fitness, one of AI's most significant limitations is its inability to read context. Adrian Kelly, a business and sports performance coach, emphasizes the risks here: \"Exercise can be quite an emotional experience with highs and lows generated by meeting, or failing to meet, our own expectations.\" He notes that traditional trainer-client relationships provide something AI cannot replicate: empathy, accountability, and trust built through genuine human connection. A skilled coach recognizes early warning signs of disordered eating, overtraining, or emotional distress. They celebrate non-scale victories, adjust plans when life gets complicated, and remind you that rest is productive.\"The healthiest results come from building trust, flexibility, and self-awareness—things a machine simply can't measure,\" D'Orazio says. \"Movement should make you feel more human, not less.\"Dr. Ayesha Bryant, a clinical advisor at Alpas Wellness, warns about the unhealthy fixation on health data that AI systems encourage. \"This heavy quantification of fitness can drive clients and patients to perfectionism or body dysmorphia tendencies, especially in vulnerable individuals,\" Bryant says. The problem is compounded by all that blind trust in the algorithm, where users continue following AI recommendations even when experiencing pain, burnout, or clear signs they need rest or medical attention.Even if someone is self-aware enough to override AI recommendations, there's still the need for algorithmic validation. It's all too easy to shift from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation, forgetting that the whole point of moving your body is because it feels good. The bottom line: Find some balanceThis isn't to say AI fitness tools have no place in a healthy lifestyle. They can be useful for tracking data, setting reminders, or logging workouts. But they should complement—not replace—human guidance and your own body awareness.Weber recommends that anyone training regularly \"consider checking in with a PT of some sort just to make sure you are still being kind to yourself.\" Bryant agrees, emphasizing that \"long-term wellness and quality of life is driven by empathy, adaptability, and human connections.\"If the fitness industry's AI revolution has arrived, we need to approach it with clear eyes. Your body is not a machine to be optimized. It's a complex, intelligent system that deserves compassion, flexibility, and human understanding—things no algorithm can provide.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Unfortunately, even the best practices come with a dark side if you take them too far. In this case, that dark side is Parkinson’s Law, an observation that suggests the longer you give yourself to do something, the longer you’ll take to actually get it done. The truth of the matter is that you can schedule, plan, and fret your way right into accomplishing nothing. It’s always better to get difficult things done as soon as possible, so let’s consider the pitfalls of Parkinson’s Law, and how you can overcome them.What is Parkinson’s law?The origins of the axiom are a little delightful: Cyril Northcote Parkinson described the phenomenon in a 1955 humorous essay in The Economist, and it’s been credited to him ever since. You can read the entire essay, but its main point is this: \"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThough it had a funny start, the idea grew until it was being studied in more serious capacities. Researchers published their findings on Parkinson’s law in the Psychonomic Bulletin & Review in 1999, finding that people tend to consider how much time is available to complete a task rather than considering how little time it might actually take. Basically, we give our future selves a little too much wiggle room when planning our schedule, then our future selves graciously accept all that extra time that could be spent doing something else. After all, our past selves, wise as they were, carved out that time for one task, and who are we to challenge that? You can probably find examples of this in your own life. If your boss gives you an easy task but sets a deadline for the following week, are you likely to get the work done immediately? Parkinson's Law gets me, more often than I'd like to admit, especially when I'm getting ready in the morning. When I used to give myself an hour to get out of the house, I'd spend it dawdling, scrolling on my phone, or generally loafing, so I started giving myself half an hour instead, with an added goal of grabbing coffee. Essentially, I started the \"getting ready\" process at the same time each day, but with an earlier deadline and an extra task. I found I still made it to where I needed to be on time, even after stopping to treat myself. Set shorter deadlines—and stick to themConsider the example of having a week to do a simple task at work. Instead of setting a week from now as the goal date and letting the task hang over you, pick a day to get it all done—ideally, one or two days before the due date, so it’s fresh in your mind if you have to discuss or explain it afterward. Schedule a block of time to do whatever needs to be done, but give yourself less time than you normally would. If you think distractions or other issues might crop up during your work time, take steps (like indicating you’re busy) to mitigate them instead of accommodating them with a time buffer.This approach is useful because it prompts you toget things done sooner and without overthinking them. It also gives you a bit of a failsafe: If you submit your work early and discover there are issues with it, you have all that saved time to address those problems and resubmit while still meeting your original deadline. (This is why I always recommend setting two deadlines for any big project.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGive yourself less time to complete tasks, not moreAs you can see by now, to defeat Parkinson’s Law, you need to give yourself less time to complete your tasks. Consider the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which says that to be your most productive, you have to have just the right amount of stress—not too little and not too much. When you have too much time to devote to something, you don’t have enough stress to motivate you.To test this out, spend a few weeks shaving some time off your allotments for different responsibilities. Use timeboxing to schedule your entire day down to the minute, using blocks of time in your calendar. If you think it will take you 30 minutes to answer all your emails in the morning, give yourself 20. If you think it will take an hour to compile reports for a big project, give yourself 45 minutes. When you cut that time down and know you only have limited space to finish a task, you will hopefully find yourself locking into a state of deep work, where you're totally focused on the task and can move through it systemically. That feeling of urgency is key.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

While it's supposed to show me what the next big game is ahead of time, the truth is, there are just too many games and too many types of players out there for it to keep up anymore. My tastes probably aren't the same as yours, and limiting the highlights to a small selection of popular picks could bury smaller titles some players might be more interested in. That's why I'm so excited about Steam's new Personal Calendar page.Released last night, it's technically an experiment, but it's already looking great. Essentially, rather than showing you a generic list of ten games like the Popular Upcoming tab (I have no idea how Valve picks those games, by the way), this instead shows you a personally curated selection of recently released and upcoming games, organized on a daily calendar, and up through the next eight weeks. The specifics depend on how you customize it, but already, it's far more useful for me than the Popular Upcoming tab.To check it out, either click here for the web version or open your Steam desktop client, and next to the search bar, navigate to Special Sections > Steam Labs > 016 Personal Calendar.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhen you first open the calendar, you'll see 100 games, split across titles released last month, titles released in the last seven days, and titles that aren't out yet. At time of writing, I currently see suggested games through Dec. 12, which gives me a pretty good window of what to look forward to. If you're eagle-eyed, you might notice that the Personal Calendar excludes weekends, which Valve says is because most games don't release on weekends. If a game Valve wants to suggest does release on a weekend, it'll instead show up on the following Monday.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nAs for the curation, I'm satisfied. Unlike the Popular Upcoming tab, the Personal Calendar uses a combination of your wishlist and your playtime in certain games to decide what to show you, making for a list that's catered to your tastes. Lately, I've been playing a lot of platformers and RPGs, and low and behold, my Personal Calendar opened right up to suggestions like Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles and Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake. These are bigger titles, but there are smaller choices I might have otherwise overlooked peppered in, and it already seems like a great way to make sure I don't miss out on a game I'd like. I even appreciate the heads-up about recently released games, which are easy to think about once and then forget.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe one criticism I have is that the default of 100 games looks a little overstuffed to me. Luckily, you can slim down your suggestions to anywhere from ten to fifty games (at the top of the page, under Game Count), which also has the benefit of narrowing down the algorithm to only show you what it thinks you'd enjoy most. Or, if you want to see as many options as possible, you can also have the calendar display 250 or 500 games. There are also controls to only show games with specific tags, and also to exclude games you've wishlisted or already own.Essentially, the Personal Calendar feels like a personalized and easy-to-check version of those \"Biggest Game Releases of the Month\" videos, except you don't need to constantly rewind or pull up the video again whenever you're looking for what to play next. Valve says your Calendar's algorithm gets re-trained daily, though, so don't expect to always see the same games on it every time you check it. If you see a game you're interested in but aren't ready to pull the trigger on yet, wishlisting it is still your best bet.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Toss in the fact that those plans to authenticate real users have now been replaced by a paid verification scheme, and it's clear the site is still figuring out how to deal with fake users. The most recent plan? Put a bunch of your personal information in an \"About this account\" section on your profile page.In an X post this week, X head of product Nikita Bier said that starting next week, the social media site will begin \"experimenting with displaying new information on profiles.\" This includes which country a user is based in, when they joined the site, how many times they've changed their username, and how they're accessing the site (via desktop or via the app, for instance).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe idea, Bier says, is that checking this information will allow users to \"to verify [an account's] authenticity.\" For instance, if you're being spammed with a bunch of suspicious followers, and they all seem to be new accounts from the same region, you might be able to infer that you're being targeted by some kind of coordinated spam attack.At the same time, however, the new section comes with privacy concerns. One user, for instance, asked Bier if X accounts will be able to opt out of having the country they're based in displayed for all to see. Another, seemingly in favor of the new system, asked if the page could include information about which device a user is posting from, to which Bier replied that the team is \"experimenting with various device details for users to form judgments on authenticity.\" Yikes.While none of that is quite as aggressive as just posting your address, it still peels back the curtain a bit more than I'd like, and leaves room for others to make judgments about you based on geography, or if Bier follows through on that second point, your model of phone.Luckily, the feature isn't guaranteed to make it live for everyone quite yet. Bier says that the initial test will begin with \"a handful of X team members to get feedback.\" And to his credit, he has been responsive in replies to his post, acknowledging that in \"countries where speech can have penalties, we should substitute country for region.\"If the new section rubs you the wrong way, now's the time to speak up about it. If, however, it does make its way towards your profile one day, there is a silver lining. Bier says that should you not want certain information made public on your profile, \"There will be privacy toggles.\" However, if a user configures them, he says \"that will likely be highlighted on their profile.\"For my own two cents, I have essentially moved on from X at this point, and bots have been a big reason why. Still, I'm not sure encouraging users to judge each other based on where they're located (or even username changes, which are common during spooky season) is the right move. While some countries are more associated with inauthentic accounts than others, real users live everywhere, and implying that readers should dismiss others based simply on where they are runs the risk of adding more toxicity to the pile. Take this bizarre reply to Bier's announcement, which implies that...Canada?...is full of trolls.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

According to a recent post on the website formerly known as Twitter, the company will soon start selling “handles that are no longer in use” to paying subscribers.The feature, called the X Handle Marketplace, is currently only being teased, but a waitlist for it is live. Once active, it’ll allow X Premium+ subscribers (at the $40/month level) and Premium Business accounts to both request free (with their subscription, at least) handles, and directly purchase especially rare ones.Rare usernames could cost $2,500 or moreAccording to an FAQ page, pricing for rare handles starts at $2,500 and could go “over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.” You’ll also need an invitation to even be allowed to purchase a paid username, although receiving the complimentary handles also comes with complications.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFor free handles, there are two types. The standard ones, called “priority handles,” are open for any eligible subscriber to request; X says it will usually review requests within three business days, although not all requests will be approved. But X also says it will occasionally drop select rare handles (the type it would usually charge for) as part of free giveaways, where multiple subscribers can apply for the handle and a winner will be selected “based on merit.”As for what X considers “merit” to be, that would include past contributions to the site, intended usage for the handle, as well as engagement and reach on the platform.Once you’ve got a new handle, your current username will be locked so others won’t be able to change it, and your page’s @ will change to the new one. X also says it may offer paid redirects from old usernames to new ones in the future.Note, though, that if you got your new handle for free, you’ll need to stay subscribed to keep using it. Users who paid for their handles will be able to let their X subscriptions lapse without losing them.What handles X will be giving out for freeAs for what type of inactivate handles X will be giving out, the site has provided a few examples. Generally, paid handles will be pithy, one word, “culturally significant names,” like @Pizza or @Tom. Meanwhile, free ones are more likely to be full names or multi-word phrases, like @GabrielJones or @PizzaEater. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs someone who doesn’t subscribe to X, it’s the full names that have me concerned—and the ones I’d suggest logging into your account to preserve. Part of the reason I haven’t deactivated my X account yet is because I don’t want someone else to be able to make an account with my username, which is a variation on my full given name. I don’t post on it very often, but I’d rather others not be able to easily masquerade as me.With that in mind, I’ve reached out to X to ask how the website will decide when to make “inactive” usernames available to request, and will update this post when I hear back. X’s inactive account policy says that users should log in “at least every 30 days” to keep their accounts active, though, so if you’re concerned about your username being taken, it’s best to play it safe.To be fair to X, redistributing usernames from inactive accounts is not an unheard of practice for social media sites, although charging for them is a bit novel. X says the reason it’s requiring a subscription to access the X Handle Marketplace is “to prevent bot spam or misuse,” so that the site can make way for “fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”However, as hinted at by another change coming to the site, a subscribed account does not necessarily mean a bot-free account. I’m curious to see how the X Handle Marketplace launch goes once the feature hits the (paying) public.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

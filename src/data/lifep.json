/><p>I really don't recommend studying with other people. In my adult life, I've accumulated an Associates, Bachelors, and Masters, plus a bunch of certificates—in all those years of studying, I was frustrated with group work much more often than I was not. Sessions would devolve into chit-chat and venting sessions or someone would try to avoid pulling their weight by foisting work off on the rest of us. I became the person who would complete the entire project and let everyone put their name on it because I just wanted to avoid all that—but it was probably because I didn't know the right methods to make these sessions productive.</p><p>There are actually a few effective methods that will help you study with partners or groups, but <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-to-study-in-a-group-if-you-must-1850857034\" target=\"_blank\"><em>you have to know them before you get into that group setting</em></a>—or else run the risk of no one getting much working done. Try one of my favorite group study methods—“think, pair, share”—the next time you want to study with someone else. I wish I'd known about this one in college, but you still have a chance.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Think, pair, share is a teaching technique typically employed by instructors, but it's easily modifiable for people getting some studying done, too. According to <a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/heyteach/article/how-think-pair-share-activity-can-improve-your-classroom-discussions1704.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Western Governors University</a>, it was developed by a professor named Frank Lyman in 1981 and is helpful for shy students, as it encourages them to engage in discussion.</p><p>The name basically tells you what you need to do: </p><ul><li><p>First, you <strong>think</strong> about the subject at hand, studying it until you are pretty sure you grasp it. </p></li><li><p>Then, you <strong>pair</strong> up with someone to discuss it.</p></li><li><p>Finally, you <strong>share</strong> what you read, understand, and don’t understand with the group afterward. </p></li></ul><p>Ideally, by going over the material together, you’ll help each other fill in gaps in your understanding and enhance what you already know.</p><h2 id=\"use-tps-to-its-maximum\">Use TPS to its maximum</h2><p>Those are overly simplistic steps, so you need to have a plan for how you'll approach each one. \"Think about the subject\" is too general. On your own, you should be reading your material critically, using a reading comprehension aid like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/kwl-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a>. Those ask you to write down what you think you know, what you want to know, and what you eventually learn, which forces you to read carefully so you find the answers. When using TPS, they perform a dual function: They give you questions you can ask to the larger group, too. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>When it comes time to share, approach it with a plan, too. Volunteer to structure the study session and have everyone go around one at a time to share their favorite insight from the material or idea for the project. Split into pairs and use the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-feynman-method-to-study-1850809398\" target=\"_blank\">Feynman technique</a>, which asks you to teach a concept to another person and relies on the idea that if you can break an idea down well enough to explain it simply, you understand it well. </p><p>If you’re familiar with other group study methods, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-jigsaw-method-to-study-complex-topics-1850849174\" target=\"_blank\">jigsaw method</a> or Feynman, some of the elements of TPS might sound familiar. With jigsaw, each person in the group studies one part of the assigned text, then explains it to everyone else. When using Feynman, you explain the topic you studied as simply as you can to someone else who knows nothing about it. The difference is that with TPS, everyone in the group knows the material before discussing, so you’re not necessarily teaching anyone or being taught, so much as you’re comparing ideas.</p><p>When you’re sharing what you know, you make space for someone else to ask follow-up questions, forcing your brain to <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">use active recall</a> to search around for the answer—or sending you back to the source material to look it up. Hearing someone else’s perspective can help you reframe how you think of the topic, causing it to stick in your brain even more. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

There are now three levels of membership to go along with the two current hardware devices. I'll explain what they are, and how to decide which one makes the most sense for you. </p><p>Whoop is the screenless fitness tracker that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-40-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>earned four stars in my review of the 4.0 model</u></a> for its integrated fitness and recovery tracking and its handling of strength training. It’s only available by subscription, with the hardware being sort of a bonus that comes with membership. (That said, if you're interested in a screenless wristband that doesn't have the subscription-worthy software, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/amazfit-helio-strap-review\" target=\"_blank\">Amazfit Helio strap</a> is a strong alternative. I have a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/amazfit-helio-strap-vs-whoop\" target=\"_blank\">comparison of the two here</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-in-the-whoop-50-versus-the-mg\">What’s in the Whoop 5.0 versus the MG</h2><p>Whoop's 5.0 device is the current one that comes along with the budget and middle-of-the-road memberships. If you remember the older Whoop 4.0, it's very similar (but a smidge smaller and has more than double the battery life). The 5.0 is the device you get with One ($199/year) and Peak ($239/year) memberships.</p><p>The MG is the \"medical grade\" version of the hardware. It's the same size and shape as the 5.0, with the same sensors, except that it has a metal clasp so it can take ECG readings. (When you take ECG readings, you touch the clasp with one hand while wearing the device on your other wrist, much like the Apple Watch and other ECG-capable wearables.) The MG comes with the $359/year Life membership.</p><p>Both devices charge with a wireless power pack; you charge the power pack over USB-C at your convenience, and then when you want to top up your Whoop's battery, you slide the pack onto the Whoop as you're wearing it. Only members of the Peak and Life tiers get the wireless power pack; the lowest tier membership comes with a wired charger. </p><h2 id=\"what-you-get-with-each-of-the-three-membership-tiers\">What you get with each of the three membership tiers</h2><p>The three new membership tiers are One ($199/year), Peak ($239/year), and Life ($359/year). One is a stripped-down membership, Peak is similar to what Whoop users have right now, and Life is a new offering with extra health features. Here’s the breakdown: </p><h3>Whoop One ($199/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWEREn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=One&short_url=QWEREn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=One\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>One</u></a> is the budget membership. You get a wired charger instead of the wireless power pack, and a “CoreKnit” band, which seems to be a new material that isn’t as nice as the SuperKnit bands offered with the higher tiers.</p><p>If you downgrade to this level, you’ll lose a few features that Whoop members currently all get: the Health Monitor (with its readings of HRV, respiratory rate, resting heart rate, and skin temperature) and the Stress Monitor, which tells you in real time how much stress you seem to be under.</p><h3>Whoop Peak ($239/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9l30vP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Peak&short_url=9l30vP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=Peak\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Peak</a> is the most similar to the single subscription level that was offered with the 4.0, both in price and features. If your subscription renews without you choosing a tier, you’ll end up on Peak. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You’ll also get the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoops-healthspan-feature-expanding-support\" target=\"_blank\">Healthspan feature</a> that tells you your “Whoop age” and your “pace of aging,” and gives recommendations to improve those metrics. </p><h3>Whoop Life ($359/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDgONb?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Life&short_url=aDgONb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=Life\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Life</u></a> is the top tier membership, and comes with the MG rather than 5.0 hardware. It includes everything in Peak, including the Healthspan feature. </p><p>With the MG you can take ECG readings, and this tier also has a feature that claims to estimate your blood pressure. You’ll need to calibrate it with readings from a blood pressure cuff to start using it. This is controversial, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fda-says-whoops-blood-pressure-feature-is-illegal\" target=\"_blank\">the FDA has told Whoop the feature is illegal</a>, but it remains available in the app for now.</p><h2 id=\"what-if-i-have-an-older-device\">What if I have an older device? </h2><p>Whoop memberships still work with the old 4.0 device, and members with a 4.0 still get access to everything the Peak membership offers, including the Healthspan feature. If your membership renews without you choosing a tier, you’ll be rolled into the Peak membership. </p><p>If you don't already own a Whoop device, don't bother getting a 4.0. Sometimes people will try to sell or give away used versions as if they're doing you a favor by giving you a discount. There's nothing wrong with using a 4.0 if you'd like to keep another device out of the landfill, but it won't save you any money personally. To use a Whoop device is to pay Whoop for a membership, and you get a 5.0 (or MG) device free when you start or renew a membership. </p>\n            </article>",

Back in April, the company <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">began testing end-to-end encrypted email messaging</a> for enterprise users. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/send-gmail-end-to-end-encrypted-emails-in-gmail.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">it officially rolled out the feature</a>. If you have a Google Workspace through work, you should now be able to send emails protected by E2EE, even if you're sending the email outside of Gmail. That should make it possible to send emails that only you, the recipient, and the IT department that manages your account can access. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/texts-may-not-be-secure-says-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">E2EE is essential</a> for anyone who wants to ensure that their communications are totally private. To simplify a complex technology, encrypting something like an email essentially means scrambling all of the code into something completely unrecognizable. In order to unscramble it, you need a \"key.\" In the case of Gmail's E2EE, you have a key, the recipient has a key, and whoever manages your Google Workspace account has a key. The keys to decrypt these emails aren't saved on Google's servers, so even Google should have no way to access your encrypted emails. You can send things like sensitive company information or medical information protected by HIPAA without worrying about prying eyes intercepting the message.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The only bummer here is that E2EE in Gmail is restricted to business accounts at this time. That said, there is a way to send more secure messages over a standard Gmail account—just don't expect E2EE-level protections.</p><h2 id=\"e2ee-for-enterprise-gmail-users\">E2EE for enterprise Gmail users</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg\" alt=\"google e2ee messaging\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759517385.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1759517385.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>In order to send E2EE emails through your enterprise Gmail account, you need to ensure your Workspace admin turns it on. Once they do, you'll need to tell Gmail you want to send your email with E2EE. To do so, open Gmail, and choose \"Compose\" to start a new email. Choose \"Message security,\" then, under \"Additional encryption,\" choose \"Turn on.\" From here, you can compose your message as you normally would, adding your recipients to the list. </p><p>If your recipient is another Google Workspace user, the message will automatically be decrypted when it reaches their inbox. If they aren't a Gmail user, they won't be able to decrypt the email in their client. Instead, they'll receive a link that opens a \"restricted\" version of Gmail. Once they sign in, the message will decrypt, and they'll be able to read and respond to it from this restricted window. Note that IT departments can choose to have all E2EE messages open in restricted Gmail windows, even if the recipients are Google Workspace users.</p><h2 id=\"use-confidential-mode-to-send-secure-messages-for-free\">Use confidential mode to send \"secure\" messages for free</h2><p>If you don't have an enterprise account, there really isn't any way to send E2EE emails through Gmail. For that, you'd need a dedicated encrypted email service, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/proton-unlimited-review-worth-it-vpn-password-manager-secure-email\" target=\"_blank\">like Proton</a>. However, you can add an extra layer of security to your messages before you send them out. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>To do so, start a new email in Gmail, then choose \"Confidential mode\" from the options. This mode blocks recipients from forwarding, copying, printing, or downloading the email. You can also choose to have the message expire after a set period of time—including one day, one week, one month, three months, or five years—as well as password protect the email. If you choose the latter, Gmail will automatically generate a password and send it to the recipients via SMS. </p><p>These added protections are certainly helpful when sending sensitive information over Gmail, but they're imperfect. Again, this is not end-to-end encryption, which means it's possible to intercept and read messages sent this way. More practically, there's nothing stopping users from taking photos of the message with another device—though the same could be said with E2EE messages.</p><p>Unless you have an enterprise account, I'd avoid sending anything too important via Gmail at this time. You're better off using a dedicated E2EE platform, like Signal, WhatsApp, or iMessage.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

This measurement is the basis for recovery scores and stress readings, and you can usually find it as a standalone measurement in the “vitals” section of your chosen app. So let’s break down what this number actually measures, and how to interpret yours. </p><h2 id=\"hrv-is-heart-rate-variability\">HRV is heart rate variability</h2><p>HRV stands for heart rate variability, but that doesn’t mean what you might think. HRV is <em>not</em> related to your heart rate changing throughout the day or during exercise. (Your heart beats faster when you’re exercising hard, which is what <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate zones</u></a> measure. Totally different purpose.) </p>\n<p>Heart rate variability refers to <em>how rhythmically</em> your heart beats. If the time from one beat to the next is always the same (at a given heart rate), you have low HRV. But if some heartbeats come more closely together, and some are more spaced out, you have high HRV. </p><p>This may be surprising, but you actually <em>want</em> your heart rate to show some variation. High HRV is considered to be better than low HRV. Your fitness app will say you’re well recovered if your HRV was higher than usual last night, and it will say you’re stressed or not recovering well if your HRV was low. </p><p>That said, it’s of course possible to have a heart rate that is <em>too</em> variable. In a sense, that’s what an arrhythmia is. When I’m talking about HRV here—and when fitness apps report your HRV—they’re considering the teeny tiny differences from beat to beat in an otherwise normal(ish) healthy(ish) person. </p><p>These differences are measured in milliseconds, and you wouldn’t notice them if you didn’t have a watch sampling data while you sleep. If you ever notice anything wildly strange about the rhythm of your heart, ask your doctor (or seek emergency medical help, if appropriate). </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-high-hrv-mean\">What does a high HRV mean? </h2><p>High heart rate variability (that is, high <em>for you</em>) tends to mean that you’re relatively relaxed and not too stressed. Fitness apps will bump up your readiness and recovery scores when your HRV measured during sleep is high. </p><p>The variation in beats is thought to come from the push and pull of two different body systems, the sympathetic (“fight or flight”) and parasympathetic (“rest and digest”) nervous systems. It’s normal for your brain and body to be balancing these needs, so this is considered a good, normal functioning. </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-low-hrv-mean\">What does a low HRV mean? </h2><p>Low HRV tends to occur when your body is working on something—recovering from hard exercise, fighting off a cold, experiencing lots of stress. If your HRV measured during sleep is low, you’ll get lower readiness or recovery scores. I find my HRV tanks when I’m sick or when I’ve been through a rough time either physically or mentally. (The day after a race or a weightlifting competition is always a low HRV day for me.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-good-hrv-number\">What is a “good” HRV number? </h2><p>I’ll give you some numbers in a minute, but the most important thing to know is that HRV is most useful when you compare readings to <em>what is normal for you</em>. Your HRV can be higher than mine, but still low for you, or vice versa. </p><p>So please don’t go around asking whether an HRV of 50 is “good.” Is it higher than usual <em>for you</em>? Then it’s good. Is it lower than usual for you? Then maybe it’s indicating that your body is under stress. If your typical HRV readings range from 35 to 50 (for example), then 50 is high for you. </p><p>It doesn’t matter whether the average person your age has a HRV of 20 or of 100; those numbers are just fun facts about the population in general. They don’t apply to you. Studies tend to show that fitter people have higher HRV, but also that HRV declines as we age. The average man’s HRV is slightly higher than the average woman’s, but the full range of what’s “normal” for each gender almost fully overlaps.</p><p>There’s one more important caveat: when you look up HRV data, you’ll find that different studies and different devices each measure HRV differently. For example, <a href=\"https://doctaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/A_Quantitative_Systematic_Review_of_Normal_Values_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this meta-analysis</u></a> found the average HRV was 42, with a range of 19 to 75, when measured as rMSSD (root mean square of successive differences). </p><p>So—and remember this is just for fun, here are some graphs from two wearable companies that publish their data <em>and</em> they both use rMSSD:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/normal-hrv-range-age-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Whoop’s breakdown of HRV data from their users</u></a> finds men have an average of 40 and women 37. They have graphs breaking down how this changes with age, and showing the variation for each group. </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/average-hrv/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Oura’s breakdown of HRV from their users</u></a> finds an average of 41 across all users, and they also graph it by age and gender. </p></li></ul><p>As I’ve found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-fitness-tracker-measure-hrv\" target=\"_blank\"><u>when comparing multiple devices on HRV</u></a>, devices don’t always report the same HRV numbers, but usually you can follow similar trends on all of them. If you’re sick, they’ll all report low HRV. If you have a good day, they’ll all report high HRV. So pay more attention to the trend than the specifics.</p>\n            </article>",

It's a signifier of my progression through Club Peloton, a new member recognition program that comes with some solid rewards.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-club-peloton\">What is Club Peloton?</h2><p>Club Peloton is a new ranking system that's meant to reflect a person's efforts and participation with Peloton workouts. Progress is applied retroactively (good news for my 201-day streak) which means I've achieved the rank of Silver III. The ranks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Silver (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Gold (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Champion</p></li><li><p>Legend</p></li></ul><p>Within each of the first three ranks, there are three tiers, and Champion and Legend each stand alone, so there are 11 levels to work through overall. </p><p>Importantly, you can never be demoted on Club Peloton; you can only move up. If you miss a week's worth of workouts while you're in Bronze III, you won't log in to find that you've been bumped down to Bronze II. It's meant to encourage you, not shame you. </p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-earn-points\">How do you earn points?</h2><p>The purpose of this new ranking system is to encourage members, make people try new things, and give recognition and rewards to participants. The methods of earning points demonstrate that. Here's what you can do to rise the ranks:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Earn two points for each day you work out with Peloton, whether using the company's equipment, its app, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strength+.</a></p></li><li><p>Earn points corresponding to your weekly streaks, so three points for a three-week streak, etc. If you work out two weeks in a row, you'll get two points. If you work out 40 weeks in a row, that week is going to end with a 40-point boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for yearly streaks, too. If you work out 52 weeks in a row, you end up with a year-long streak, which earns you double points. Instead of 52 points at the end of that year, you get 104. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for milestones. Milestones can be found on your Peloton profile and include things like taking 10 or 25 of a certain kind of class. When you achieve a milestone in a second activity beyond one you've already got one in, you get a 10% boost. Milestones in three or more give you a 20% boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for participating in programs. Every week you are actively involved in one, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton's FTP program</a>, you get two points. You get one point for every class you complete in your new, AI-generated personal plan and 10 points any time you undertake a Peloton challenge. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for being a team player. Every week, you can earn up to one point each for giving someone a virtual high five during class, taking a live class, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a Team</a>. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-are-the-ranks-calculated\">How are the ranks calculated?</h2><p>Want to know how many points are required to raise your rank? Here's the breakdown:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze is your level if you have zero to 99 points.</p></li><li><p>Silver is for 100 to 1,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Gold covers 2,000 points to 14,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Champion is 15,000 to 29,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Legend is for anyone with over 30,000 points.</p></li></ul><p>Like I said, I'm on a daily streak that stretches almost two-thirds of a year and I'm only in Silver III with just 1,205 points and 795 to go until I hit Gold I. You can tap into your point history to see a breakdown of how you got to where you are. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-all-this\">What is the point of all this?</h2><p>To me, this is awesome, but I am a well-known lover of all manner of streak-based app gimmicks. I will do anything for the pleasure of a digital badge, like go to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">Dunkin' Donuts every day</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/finch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">keep track of my to-do list</a> on an app that forces me to report my progress to a little cartoon bird. Simply put, I find it motivating to compete for something, even if I'm just competing with myself to earn what amounts to little more than pixels. </p><p>Club Peloton, however, amounts to more than that: The company promises that as you work through ranks, you'll unlock \"surprises.\" Future surprises notwithstanding, some of the rewards are already known. You can get early access to new classes or challenges, discounts on apparel or other retail goods, instructor shoutouts during class, and invitations to exclusive in-person events. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Studies have suggested writing by hand helps you retain information better than using a computer, which is why <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">you should only bring a notebook and pen</a> with you to class in addition to (or instead of) your laptop. </p><p>But there’s more to effective note-taking than jotting down a bunch of bullet points. To be useful, your notes should be organized into topics and subtopics, with a sensible flow that you’ll be able to follow later. That’s why you should revise your notes immediately after class—even before you leave your seat, if you can. </p></div><h2 id=\"what-to-do-with-notes-after-class\">What to do with notes after class</h2><p>When you’re taking notes—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">whether typed or hand-written</a>—you have to be picky about what you do and don’t write down, given how much time it takes to do so before the lecturer moves on to another point you don’t want to miss. This is great for helping you stay engaged with the class and think critically about what is and isn’t important, but leaves the potential for gaps in your notes that you won’t realize are there until later, once you’re reading them over. So it’s best to read them over right away, and revise them as necessary.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Marty Lobdell, a former professor emeritus at Pierce College who spent 40 years teaching psychology and study skills, recommends immediate note revision and expansion in his “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Study Less, Study Smart</a>” video. While the lecture is fresh in your mind, he advises, you should use your memory of it, plus your texts and other course materials, to expand on the notes you took down.</p><p>Rewrite them completely, adding key details to what you already deemed was important in class, including anything relevant in the supplemental materials. Doing so will not only make your notes easier to study later, but will help you retain the information, since rewriting them will be your first chance to review what you’ve learned.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-maximize-your-post-class-notes\">How to maximize your post-class notes</h2><p>While taking notes in class, it’s best to be brief and concise, especially since you know you’ll be expanding them later. You can <a href=\"https://sites.austincc.edu/student-skills-workshops/taking-effective-notes/notetaking-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">use abbreviations and codes to write faster</a>, as long as you’re sure you’ll be able to decode and expand upon them later. After class, review and edit your notes, compare them to your textbook or course materials, and, if possible, another student’s notes, so you’re sure you’re not missing anything.</p><p>While writing initially and when revising, choose<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\"> the most effective note-taking method for your personal study style</a>. The outlining method works best for recopying and involves putting general information on the left side of your paper and indenting more specific groups of facts underneath. For your in-class note-taking, consider the Cornell method, which requires you to write down quick bits of information on the left side of your paper, then fill in more specifics on the right when you have time later.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Whichever method you choose, don’t leave class until your note expansion is complete (or, if that’s not realistic, take care of it as soon as possible after class). Review your notes between and 10 minutes before the next class so everything is fresh in your mind before you move on.</p><h2 id=\"ideas-for-better-notes-and-revision\">Ideas for better notes and revision</h2><p>Taking notes using an established method, like Cornell, is your best bet, since it gives you a little structure while you go. The way you revise them is important, too. I recommend reformatting them <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">into a mind map</a>. This is a visual representation of how concepts work together. Reminiscent of a flowchart, it uses bubbles, colors, and arrows to denote related topics and subtopics. Here, you can call on tech for backup. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">I like the Xmind app</a> for creating simple, fast mind maps. </p><p>The benefits of revising this way are numerous. First, you force yourself not just to focus on topics and concepts, but on how they all fit together, which helps entrench them in your mind and enhance your understanding overall. Second, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">adding in some color</a> or intrigue helps with retention, too. Third, forcing yourself to reformat the notes in a completely different way than you took them makes you think differently about them and focus on getting everything right.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Smart home devices can streamline a lot of your day-to-day tasks. With an internet connection and some simple automations, you may never have to carry house keys, turn off the lights, or touch your thermostat again. But all of this convenience comes at a potential cost, as smart tech is vulnerable to attack by cyber actors, leaving your personal data and your privacy at risk. </p><p>Here's what you need to know to secure your smart home.</p><h2 id=\"is-your-smart-home-secure\">Is your smart home secure? </h2><p>The short answer: not by default. Smart homes have vulnerabilities at multiple levels, from the devices themselves, to your home network, to the physical endpoints, like your phone, that have access to and control over your Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\n<p>To start, IoT devices may have weak built-in security protocols or lack clear instructions to help users lock them down from factory settings, leaving them vulnerable to hackers, who may have to exert very little effort to access your data or spy on you. Wifi routers and smart home devices often have default credentials that are publicly available and therefore easy to get past—and  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/router-reality-check-86-percent-default-passwords-have-never-been-changed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">data show</a> that the vast majority of users have never changed their router admin password or adjusted any factory settings. If your home network isn't secure, nothing connected to it can be considered secure either. </p><p>Smart devices can also be integrated into botnets, allowing threat actors to conduct malicious activity like account takeovers and malware distribution using your home network. A recent instance of this was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign known as BADBOX 2.0</a>, which targeted off-brand consumer electronics manufactured in China. </p><p>Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), notes the digital divide may increase the risk for some consumers, who may seek out cheaper devices from low-cost manufacturers that have weaker security and far less to lose in terms of reputation if they are implicated in vulnerabilities as compared to major companies like Amazon. </p><p>Finally, security can be compromised if your physical devices fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you control your smart home using apps on your phone, a threat actor could gain access in the event said phone is lost, stolen, or hacked.  </p><h2 id=\"smart-homes-can-compromise-privacy\">Smart homes can compromise privacy</h2><p>Left unsecured, smart home devices can also put your privacy (and potentially your safety) at risk. Internet-connected cameras, from baby monitors to pet cams, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/can-someone-spy-through-webcam-or-phone\" target=\"_blank\">are vulnerable to hacking</a>, and threat actors can use them to surveil you and your home. This may include snooping on and tracking your movements, \"shoulder surfing\" to collect sensitive personal information from your devices, recording audio and video footage of your private activities, and sharing or selling live feeds on the dark web. (In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-baby-monitor-hacked-by-man-who-threatened-kidnapping-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a particularly alarming incident in 2018</a>, a hacker reportedly issued verbal threats toward a four-month-old child through a Nest-branded baby monitor.)</p><p>Your smart tech is also likely collecting a lot of information about you in the course of its normal activities—all of which could be exploited. For example, your robot vacuum creates and utilizes a map of your home's physical layout to know where to go, and usage patterns from various automations can be used to track your movements and confirm when you're away from home. </p><p>There's also the possibility that your smart home devices are compromising your data in ways you aren't aware of and haven't actively consented to. A <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-reveals-alarming-privacy-and-security-threats-smart-homes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2023 report from security experts</a>—led by the nonprofit IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University—shows that IoT devices may inadvertently expose personal information that can be harvested and sold to companies involved in surveillance capitalism. Researchers found that spyware apps and advertisers abuse local network protocols to access sensitive data, making it easier to profile users. </p><h2 id=\"no-security-standards-for-smart-homes\">No security standards for smart homes</h2><p>One of the biggest barriers to smart home security is that there isn't a single set of cybersecurity standards that companies have to follow, nor a centralized resource for users to research this information. Earlier this year—during the last few weeks of the Biden administration—the Federal Communications Commission launched the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">U.S. Cyber Trust Mark</a> voluntary labeling program to incentivize device manufacturers to improve security and help consumers buy with confidence. However, under the Trump administration, the agency later <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-cyber-trust-mark-ul-investigation-delay/758507/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">launched an investigation</a> into the program, delaying its rollout. </p><p>For now, consumers are left to do their own due diligence. In 2017, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation created a resource called <a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">*Privacy Not Included</a>, with reviews of products measured against \"minimum security standards\" and breakdowns of any privacy concerns. The site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last year, but you can still find detailed information about the privacy and security history of well-known smart home manufacturers like Amazon, Google, Wyze, and Ecobee. </p><p>Otherwise, Budington suggests simply searching the device you're considering (and the company that makes it) before buying, to see if researchers or users have reported any concerns. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-improve-your-smart-home-security\">How to improve your smart home security</h2><p>Securing your smart home starts with securing your internet connection via your router. Lifehacker has assembled a whole <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-make-your-home-security-system-and-wireless-network-safe\" target=\"_blank\">guide to protecting your home network</a>, but at the very least, you should change any default router settings—admin usernames, passwords, and network names—to something unique and not personally identifiable, and turn on encryption in your wireless security settings. Regularly check for updates, which provide patches for security flaws, and audit the devices connected to your network to identify anything suspicious and remove those you no longer use. </p><p>You can add another layer of security with a guest network set up specifically for your IoT devices. That way, if your smart devices are compromised, everything connected to your primary network (such as computers and phones with access to your personal and financial accounts) will be protected. </p><p>According to Budington, one way to further mitigate vulnerability is to reduce the number of devices with their own wireless connection, running them through a secure, centralized hub instead. Home Assistant is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/self-host-apps\" target=\"_blank\">self-hosted option</a> that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or a traditional PC or used with the plug-and-play Home Assistant Green. Hubitat also gives you local control over your device data and integrates with a variety of products, including those compatible with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-most-important-smart-home-decision-is-the-ecosystem-you-choose\" target=\"_blank\">Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter standards</a>. </p><p>Once your network is secure, you'll want to <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/securing-your-internet-connected-devices-home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">take similar steps</a> with each of your IoT devices. Change default usernames and passwords to unique, secure alternatives and enable all available security features, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, in the device settings. Ensure your devices (and any apps used to control them) receive automatic firmware updates. </p><p>You should also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-protect-your-privacy-when-using-smart-home-tech\" target=\"_blank\">check your device's privacy settings</a>, removing permissions that aren't essential for it to function and disabling features you won't use. For example, you could turn off location tracking on your smart thermostat and disable voice control for devices other than your voice assistant. </p><p>Finally, while we've focused mostly on digital threats, your smart home isn't immune to physical compromise. Be aware of ways your devices can be accessed, such as those installed on the exterior of your house, and ensure phones and tablets and the apps on them that control IoT devices are secured with a PIN or biometric authentication.</p><p>Remember that, by nature, anything connected to the internet is at least somewhat vulnerable to attack. You'll have to consider your own risk tolerance and weigh the convenience of having a smart device against the potential for it to be compromised—and your privacy along with it. You may find that there are some things that you simply don't need to automate, and therefore you can stick with the \"dumb\" alternative. </p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBGBC5PWJAAJJJHG350CH/image.fill.size_150x150.v1737570988.png\" alt=\"Photo of Emily Long\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Emily</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-october-6-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NDPMNVDG8VP9H60X546HEA/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759508124.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-october-5-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NDGZ2QQ13JNXHP4D0WZTXM/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759507938.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>",

This week's edition of the Out of Touch Adult’s Guide to Kid Culture features a new body slang term, a TikTok prank where AI puts a hobo into your living room, the possible beginning of the AI wars, and a viral video featuring students running a Nazi out of class. There's a lot to eat, so tuck your napkin in your shirt and chow down.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-venus-tummy\">What is a Venus tummy?</h2><p>A \"Venus tummy\" is a slang term for a woman's belly that is a little fat, but not too fat—a little pouch that can be shown off in tight clothing. Like so: </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nxstypxet/status/1969854168665133335\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The name comes from ancient Greece, where Venus was depicted as, uh, fleshy, as you can see from these three statues of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Venus\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">crouching Venus</a>:\"</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759534666.png\" alt=\"three crouching Venuses\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759534666.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1759534666.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759534666.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Wikipedia</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>While women having bellies is not new, the term \"Venus tummy\" (and the acknowledgment that many people find that feature very attractive) is. I guess older slang terms like zaftig, thicc, stacked, and \"built like a brick shithouse\" are not specific enough, and specificity is important in objectification. If the internet <em>has</em> to objectify women (and it sure seems like it does) at least Venus tummy is based in history and is more positive and healthy than sexualizing being extremely skinny. So yeah, it's a little creepy, but \"a little creepy\" is the best we can hope for these days.</p><h2 id=\"ai-homeless-man-prank\">AI homeless man prank</h2><p>If your child sends you a picture of a homeless person sitting on your couch and asks, \"what should I do?\" don't panic. It's (probably) a prank. The new video trend online is freaking out your parents and other loved ones with an AI-generated image of an unhoused person, then posting a video about it to TikTok, like this:</p><blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and this: </p><blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You might think you're going to be clever and pull a switcheroo on your child, but I warn you, this will not work. They will immediately clock the image as fake, post a sarcastic emoji, and leave you on read, as you can see:</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759534666.png\" alt=\"Text prank\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1759534666.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1759534666.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759534666.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Stephen Johnson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"two-stories-of-backlash-against-ai\">Two stories of backlash against AI</h2><p>AI is great for generating pictures of people in unfortunate situations on your couch, but the way it's taking over everything worthwhile about humanity is less great. Thankfully, there's evidence that AI destruction of humanity will at least meet token resistance, and that the backlash against artificial intelligence is growing. </p><h3>NYC doesn't want an AI \"Friend\"</h3><p>Back in 2024, the world first learned of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-the-friend-ai-pendant\" target=\"_blank\">\"Friend\" pendant</a>, a little AI device you wear around your neck thats only purpose is to provide a simulation of human interaction. Now that they're actually available to purchase, the company behind them has launched an advertising campaign; it's going extremely poorly. </p><p>In New York City, subway and street posters for the Friend device are being defaced mercilessly and creatively, <a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/003/144/526/38c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">like so</a>, with people scrawling messages like \"<a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/003/144/527/667.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">AI will promote suicide when prompted</a>. It is not your friend\" on them. I'm not exactly pro vandalism, but in this case, I make an exception. </p><h3>Tilly Norwood, the first \"AI actress\"</h3><p>A few days ago, <em>Variety</em> posted a story about <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/ai-actress-tilly-norwood-talent-agents-zurich-summit-1236533454/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Tilly Norwood</a>, an \"AI actress\" whose creator, comedian and producer Eline Van der Velden, lied that he had \"attracted the attention of multiple talent agents\" for Norwood. A creation of \"AI talent studio\" Xicoia, Norwood's first video role is below:</p>\n<p>Apparently, the above video is considered \"funny\" in the UK.  Anyway, soon after Norwood was announced as existing, real talent agencies responded with \"t<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/gersh-ai-actress-tilly-norwood-representation-1236534829/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">he fuck out of here with this dumb shit.</a>\" as did <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sag-aftra-sean-astin-ai-actress-tilly-norwood-1236536540/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SAG, the actors union</a>, and everyone else worthwhile.</p><p>But with her name in public, troubling news of Norwood's past became public, as you can see in this X post:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lunch_enjoyer/status/1972701356193620276\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Created in three and 30 seconds by Stephen Johnson Studios, Extreme has attracted the attention of multiple talent agents for his bad-boy image and his ceaseless rule-breaking. He's an accident looking for a place to happen. Here's his audition video, suckers:</p>\n<p>(If you want to hire Johnny Extreme, please send me money.)</p><h2 id=\"what-does-my-steak-is-too-juicy-mean\">What does \"my steak is too juicy\" mean? </h2><p>The phrases \"my steak is too juicy\" and \"my lobster is too buttery\" are online slang used to suggest someone is complaining about something they should be grateful for. To see it in context and bring things full circle to Venus tummy, <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/3142936-my-steak-is-too-juicy-my-lobster-is-too-buttery\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">click here</a>. </p><h2 id=\"viral-video-of-the-week-how-to-treat-nazis\">Viral video of the week: How to treat Nazis</h2><p>This week's viral video comes from the University of Washington, where an attention-seeking Nazi type disrupted a lecture in a Psychology class by grabbing the mic, throwing up the Elon Musk hand sign,  screaming slurs and obscenities, and calling the sexuality class \"degenerate nonsense.\"</p><p>The students respond by booing him and chasing him out of the class, with their badass professor leading, chased him down. But they don't give him the beating he's trying to provoke. Instead, they hold him down and wait for the authorities to come and take him away. (Although the agitator does get a satisfying face full of pepper spray for his trouble.)</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrodyFoxx/status/1973780782704717883\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sora-by-openai/id6744034028&ved=2ahUKEwiMpIro6Y-QAxUflokEHWKIGMkQFnoECCcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw16dSqCy43Mucovh1Db1gX3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the number one free app on the iOS App Store</a>. The app makes it possible for users to generate hyper-realistic short-form videos from simple AI prompts. If you find your TikTok or Instagram feeds to feature a few too many posts made by humans, Sora offers you a feed devoid of any manmade content: Everything you see, from <a href=\"https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sora-2-sam-altman-grilling-pikachu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman roasting a Pikachu on the grill</a>, to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/sora-2-first-impressions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">speeches from Martin Luther King Jr. about Xbox Game Pass</a>, is entirely fabricated and generated by the Sora video model. As the kids say, we are so cooked.  </p><p>The implications are distressing, terrifying, and, to this tech editor, nauseating. But it's not just the fact that these videos are lifelike that's setting off my anxieties; it's also the app's \"cameo\" feature, which lets you insert real people into one of these AI concoctions. If you request a video of someone skateboarding across a skyscraper, for example, Sora doesn't have to generate a fake person. Instead, you can ask it to put yourself in the video. If your friends are on the platform, you can instead choose to cast one of them as the skateboarder, too. The same goes for any account that has made their cameo settings public, which is how we got so many unhinged videos of Altman and other OpenAI execs. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>OpenAI is pitching Cameos as a fun way to communicate and share with friends. I, and others like me, see it as a deepfake machine, with the potential to generate videos of anyone doing just about anything. OpenAI would disagree, of course. The company promises it has \"guardrails\" in place designed to prevent generations that are harmful or offensive, as well as the misuse of other people's likenesses. In order to set up a cameo, you need to take a video of yourself while speaking, which gives the video model the information needed to plop you into these short clips. Ideally, you are in control of your cameos: If you don't want other people generating videos of you, you can choose to block them from being made. If you don't like a video someone made with your cameo, you can request that OpenAI delete it from Sora—even if you didn't make the video yourself.</p><p>Despite OpenAI's assurances, I'm not convinced this won't get ugly fast. Still, it's worth it to go over the settings you <em>can</em> adjust to control how your likeness is used (or not used) on Sora.</p><h2 id=\"block-other-sora-users-from-putting-you-in-cameos\">Block other Sora users from putting you in cameos</h2><p><a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12435986-generating-content-with-cameos\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">These settings only apply once you set up your cameo</a>. If you simply use the app to watch videos, there are no settings for you to adjust. However, if you have made a cameo, you can use a few control to limit how it is used.</p><p>To find your cameo settings, open Sora, tap your profile icon in the bottom right, then tap the two-lined menu button in the top right and choose <strong>\"Cameo rules.\"</strong> Here, you can adjust who can use your cameo from the following options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Only me</strong>: No other Sora users can use your cameo.</p></li><li><p><strong>People I approve</strong>: Choose specific Sora users that can use your cameo. </p></li><li><p><strong>Mutuals</strong>: Anyone you follow who follows you back can use your cameo. </p></li><li><p><strong>Everyone</strong>: Anyone on the platform can use your cameo. (I strongly recommend you do <em>not</em> use this option.)</p></li></ul><p>Note that changing these settings will only apply to videos going forward. If you originally allowed mutuals or all users to use your cameo, but you drop down to people you approve, or even just yourself, all previous videos made with your cameo will remain on the platform. </p><p>You also have some granular control over how your cameos are used, as Bill Peebles, head of Sora, <a href=\"https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1974969638300901817\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">announced on X</a>. If you head back to your cameo settings, choose <strong>\"Cameo preferences\"</strong> then <strong>\"Restrictions.\"</strong> Here, you should have the option to enter any restriction you want, which will block others from including those restrictions when using your cameo. For example, you could block people from putting you in political videos, or from saying specific words or phrases. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"delete-other-peoples-videos-that-use-your-cameo\">Delete other people's videos that use your cameo</h2><p>If you see a video that someone made using your cameo and you don't want it on the platform anymore, you can ask OpenAI to delete it. To do so, open the video, then choose \"Report.\" Here, you can request a takedown. OpenAI says it will \"review and take action\" if the video uses your cameo \"against your settings or rules.\" That's a little too vague for my liking, but it's good to know this system is in place if you find yourself in this position. </p><h2 id=\"delete-your-sora-account-to-nuke-all-videos-using-your-cameo\">Delete your Sora account to nuke all videos using your cameo</h2><p>There is a nuclear option as well: delete your Sora account altogether. OpenAI says that any videos that use a cameo attached to a deleted account will also be removed from the platform. They're much more specific with the language here, so I'd imagine this is the best way to guarantee your cameos are not floating around Sora in ways you don't want them to.</p><h2 id=\"there-are-still-a-lot-of-potential-risks\">There are still a lot of potential risks</h2><p>It's great that OpenAI is giving users controls who can use their likeness in Sora videos, but, in my view, it's just not enough. OpenAI created a tool that lets other users <em>seamlessly</em> <em>place you into AI-generated videos</em>. The risk for misuse is simply too great to think of this product as anything other than a deepfake disaster waiting to happen. </p><p>OpenAI says you can request to delete any video that uses your cameo, but what if OpenAI doesn't think the video violates your rules or settings? More concerningly, what happens when someone takes that video off Sora and publishes it on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube instead? Is OpenAI going to track down every company that is hosting the video and demand they delete it? Or could your face, your voice, your entire likeness, be plastered across social media, in a video that isn't even real? OpenAI requires you to record yourself before creating a cameo, but what if someone figures out how to use existing videos of you to create an illegitimate cameo without your permission? All the cameo restrictions and settings in the world won't let you control what happens with <em>those</em> videos. And while OpenAI considers their initial approach to Sora generations \"conservative,\" I've seen some <em>wild</em> stuff on this platform already. If you think users won't find ways to trick the AI into generating videos of you that are offensive, disgusting, or otherwise negative, think again. </p><p>I don't know where we're going from here, but I know one thing: I'll never use the cameo feature on Sora, and I'd encourage you to do the same. If you already have, restrict your settings as much as you're willing to. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

/><p>Do you want to learn the material you’re studying—like, <em>really </em>learn it? I'm not talking about learning enough to pass a test, but rather, learning enough that you know it for life. Then what you need to do is <em>overlearn</em> it. One learning theory suggests that if you overlearn, you’ll attain automaticity, or the ability to do something without having to think about it, and ultimately retain more knowledge. Here’s what overlearning is and how to do it.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-overlearning\">What is overlearning?</h2><p>You know something is serious when the <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/overlearning\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">American Psychological Association has a definition for it</a>, and that’s the case here: Per the APA, overlearning is “practice that is continued beyond the point at which the individual knows or performs the task as well as can be expected.” The APA says the benefits here can include “increased persistence of the learning over time or better retention and memory.” The terminology makes sense; once you've learned something <em>over</em> the extent you need to, it becomes second nature. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Simply put, overlearning involves studying something even once you’re sure you know it, which is why this technique is overlooked and, if I'm being honest, a little annoying. It makes sense that once you get information down, you don't want to seemingly waste time going over it, but according to this theory, that is, unfortunately, when the magic happens. Don’t stop reviewing or studying just because you succeeded in memorizing something. Instead, keep going, digging it deeper and deeper into your brain.</p><p>Hermann Ebbinghaus, the researcher who brought us the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-beat-the-forgetting-curve-while-studyi-1850791645\" target=\"_blank\">Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</a>, studied memory in the 1890s, figuring out that as time passed, memories decreased. (That’s basically what the forgetting curve is all about and a pretty common-sense phenomenon you have certainly experienced in your own life.) According to him, overlearning happens when you keep repeating what you’re going over well past the point at which you can recall it with 100% accuracy. Think about a story you've told numerous times over your lifetime. If you hadn't started reciting it at parties and on first dates, the details may have gotten fuzzy, but since you did, it's practically a well-rehearsed performance at this point. </p><p>See, <em>recalling </em>it is something that takes effort. The goal of overlearning is to reach automaticity, <a href=\"https://cirl.etoncollege.com/dont-just-learn-emoverlearn-em/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">pulling the information from your longterm memory</a> with no effort and freeing up space in your working memory.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-overlearn\">How do you overlearn?</h2><p>The next time you’re studying, review material you already know front to back. For instance, when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">using the Leitner method</a> (which involves spaced repetition of flash cards, the frequency of review of each depending on how well you did the last time you quizzed yourself on it), always review all the flashcards you’re assigned on a particular day, even if you feel like skipping them because you got them right last time. Repeatedly going over material you know well is the key to overlearning and eventual automatic recall.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Flashcards, in general, are a great way to study and they're perfect for this, especially if you're following the Leitner technique. Just because a flashcard has been moved into the section you study less frequently doesn't mean you should never go back to it. In fact, if you're trying to overlearn, it's one of the only times I'd recommend not using Leitner—at least not right away. For the first few days of reviewing your cards, go through all of them and don't sort them by whether you get the answers right or wrong. Just keep drilling the same information over and over again.</p><p>Another useful tool here is the practice of blurting, which is what we call it when you write down or say everything you can remember about a topic. That <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">forces active recall</a>—or the act of consciously yanking information out of your long-term memory—and trains you to quickly identify key details in your brain. At the end of every week, do a round of blurting, even if you nailed all the details last time around.</p><p>Schedule blocks of time in your week for reviewing materials you’ve already mastered when you're <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">pre-planning your distributed practice</a>. This can be as easy as re-reading a chapter or your notes, or as complex as taking practice quizzes or using flashcards. Continually reintroducing familiar ideas to yourself will dig them deeper into your longterm memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

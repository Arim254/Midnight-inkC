The portable machine is not strictly playing them all by itself, and you do need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to do it, but the latest system update brings the PlayStation Portal a lot closer to being a true PSP successor.The news came earlier today via the official PlayStation blog, where Sony announced that cloud streaming for the PS Portal will soon officially go live for everyone with a compatible subscription, a little less than a year after the company started testing it with an optional beta. That means that the device can finally live untethered from a console, without any additional setup.It's a breath of fresh air for the Portal, which, when it launched back in 2023, garnered negative reviews for its limited power and portability. While previous Sony handhelds like the PSP and PS Vita were able to play games on their own, disconnected from the internet, at launch the PS Portal could only play games by remotely connecting to a PS5—something gamers could already do on other devices like mobile phones.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThat severely limited the device's usefulness, essentially turning it into an accessory rather than its own console. After today's update, it still needs an internet connection, but the handheld is a lot more useful as a standalone experience.How to cloud game on the PlayStation Portal\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sony\n                    \n    \nStarting at 6 p.m. PT today, Nov. 5, Sony will start pushing the update live. Once it hits your device, you should see a new UI that, if you weren't in the beta already, will add the option to select a cloud icon to the device's top-left corner. Click through, and as long as you have a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription, you'll be taken to a brand new menu (new even to beta users) that shows all cloud-compatible games, either from games you own or from the PlayStation Plus library. Choose one, and you'll connect directly to Sony's servers, where you can start playing without getting your home console involved.It's not a perfect solution, but Sony advertises it as a way to play its games \"even when your PS5 console back home is powered off or is in use by another account.\" Personally, I'd also like to point out that you could now technically buy a Portal and not get a PS5, instead playing only through the cloud rather than using a console and remote play. At $200, the Portal is less than half the cost of a PS5, so it would save you a decent amount of upfront cost.Still not a perfect handheld solutionThat said, there are still drawbacks. While a cloud connection frees you from having to connect to a PS5 for remote play, it still won't allow you to play in areas without reliable high-speed internet, like on an airplane. It also risks introducing input lag into your gameplay, which means it's not a great choice for competitive titles. Visuals also might appear compressed, depending on your internet speed, and only certain titles are available via the cloud (although hundreds of games are already compatible).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe biggest caveat, though, is the required PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. That'll run you $18/month. It's up to you whether that's worth it over connecting to a console via remote play.On the plus side, Sony promises that it has improved support for public wifi on the Portal, which should make for a smoother experience when playing in a coffee shop or at a hotel. Cloud gaming also now comes with access to features that weren't available during the beta, like in-game purchases, multiplayer invites, and new accessibility options like a screen reader. Outside of cloud gaming, the new update also adds 3D audio support to the PS Portal as a whole, so long as you're using wired headphones or Sony's own Pulse earbuds or headset.It's definitely still a stopgap when compared to an entirely standalone device that can play its own games instead of streaming them (like the Nintendo Switch 2), but if you're a Sony gamer who misses being able to play on the go,  the PS Portal should now be able to bring back some of those fond PSP memories—as long as you're in a spot with good wifi.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

When you don’t get all your tasks done, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and disappointed in yourself, which doesn’t help you push through to finish those tasks, let alone feel like you’re thriving.You should be happy. You need to be productive. Reaching a state of zen can help you accomplish both—or so goes the theory behind the “Zen to Done” method, which aims to help you get more good and feel good about it. Unlike some other productivity approaches, this one has less to do with strict deadlines and weedy details than it does with pushing through and feeling good about a job well done. This makes it well suited to those who don't exactly blossom under pressure.What is Zen to Done?Zen to Done is a productivity system conceptualized by Zen Habits’ Leo Babauta. It’s structured around building simple habits that enable you to get your work done and feel good at the same time. Other methods, like the once ubiquitous “Getting Things Done” system, get a bad rap for expecting you to build all your new habits at once, jumping immediately into a whole new lifestyle. That sort of all-or-nothing change can work for some people, but it might not be for you. But ZTD is focused on building them incrementally and more peacefully. There's room to adjust and grow, which can be soothing—especially if you have a lot of habits to change or you're particularly stuck in your ways.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe habit changes come in a series, but one at a time, allowing you to focus on the actual work you need to get done. In the original version of ZTD, there are 10 habits, but you should only try to incorporate two to three of them at one time before moving on to others.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCollect by always taking notes about what you need to do, ideas you have, or changes to a task or project.Process by making quick decisions on tasks that are in front of you right now, like emails that could soon pile up. Plan by setting goals for your week every Monday, and tackling larger tasks earlier in the week.Do by selecting a task and focusing on it without thinking about or doing anything else. Create a simple trusted system that works for you, like doing certain tasks at the same time every day or tapping into an email system like the 4Ds with consistenc.Organize by giving everything a place—and putting it there every time. This goes for emails, tools on your desk, and anything else that’s cluttering your mind or space. Review your weekly goals at the end of the week, but also keep tabs on your longer-term quarterly or annual goals to keep them fresh in your mind and see how your daily work plays into them. Simplify by using your review time to slash your goals and tasks into only what’s most essential at any given time. Make a routine that works for you, whether it’s a calmer morning routine, or  more structured evenings—and absolutely stick to it. Find your passion and make sure it’s guiding your work. This is where ZTD differs from other productivity methods: You should always strive to keep the things you care about at the center of what you’re doing, as a reminder of why you’re working so hard or a check on whether a project is really worth it all.Over the past year, I've adopted a few of these changes: collect (and, by extension, plan), plus process and organize. I've been dedicated to growing financially and becoming more organized, but I knew neither of those things would happen overnight, so I started writing down \"to-dos\" whenever they popped into my head. I stick them in a note in my phone, reorganize the note every Monday, and check it every morning to see what I can do—then jump straight into the things that are attainable in that moment. The other day, I noticed my fan was dirty but I didn't have time to clean it write then, so I wrote a note—clean the fan—in my phone, and was able to follow up on it the next day without stressing. Making changes and getting things done bit by bit in this way has resulted in major financial wins and a significantly cleaner, more organized home. It's a far cry from how things went in the past, when I put too much pressure on myself to change instantly. Get started with “Minimalist ZTD”All of that sounds like a lot—and it is, even though you’re only supposed to start rolling in the habits one at a time. So pull back a bit: Babauta considers the first four (collect, process, plan, and do) the core of a “Minimalist ZTD” program, and advises picking one of them and focusing on it for 30 days. After a month, you’ll be in the habit of using that approach to your work and can move on to one of the other three. And once the four big are securely ingrained in your habits, you can move on to the full list.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The app that can turn your notes into a podcast can now generate an educational video based on your study materials. It can also create a report or document from suggested, pre-made templates. How the new NotebookLM tools workIf you're unfamiliar, NotebookLM is a large language model akin to the better-known chatbot ChatGPT, but instead of pulling information from all over the internet (with all the risks of inaccuracy that creates), it relies only on material you input directly. You can upload PDFs, links, YouTube videos, plain text, and more, then ask the chatbot questions and it will answer based only on what you've given it, even providing links to where it finds the answers in the source material. As noted, it can also generate AI podcasts, which feature two voices discussing your materials, as well as flashcards, mind maps, or practice quizzes. Video and report generation are the latest additions to NotebookLM's toolset. You can try them out by locating the appropriate tile along the right side of the screen within your NotebookLM notebook. (Though the app is, frankly, underwhelming, so I recommend always using a desktop computer or mobile browser  instead.)How video generation worksThe educational videos are excellent for students or anyone trying to learn something new. I generated one based on the materials I've been using within NotebookLM to study for an upcoming certification exam, and though it definitely took over the promised five minutes to create, it came out surprisingly good:\nContent from my study guides and materials is included, with key information highlighted visually and with further explanation from a voiceover. How to generate reports with NotebookLMThe reports are a little more complex. When I pressed Report, I got options like, \"Anatomy Explainer\" and \"Business Development Plan\" as suggested choices based on my material. \"Briefing,\" \"Study Guide,\" and \"Blog Post\" are standard suggestions that are always available. I asked a friend who also uses NotebookLM to study for school, and their suggested formats for their Management Concepts class materials were \"Strategic Analysis\" and \"Leadership Profile.\"So it seems that based on what your materials include, the software will create outlines in downloadable document format. I selected \"Anatomy Explainer\" and, after waiting a few minutes, got a detailed study doc divided into sections like \"The Command Center: Your Nervous System\" and \"The Framework: Your Skeletal System.\" It was outlined clearly, like a study guide with more explanation and context. Why I love these new featuresI am a major proponent of using NotebookLM for studying, particularly, because it's such an easy way to organize your materials and make sure that your work aligns with what your teacher is looking for. Plus, unlike ChatGPT, you can't exactly use it to do all the work for you; instead, it shows you where it got the information (from materials you provided), enabling you to study more efficiently. The videos and reports are another way to do that, so whether you study best by listing to audio, watching videos, mind-mapping, drilling flashcards, or reading summaries, it's an ideal choice. You can even ask the chatbot followup questions on anything you don't grasp. The reports, especially, have implications for other kinds of work, beyond studying. I use NotebookLM to help me organize my files and materials for my job all the time, so the ability to create a briefing doc or business plan is an added bonus that could be helpful to people in a variety of fields. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The company already has AI tools that let you ask Gemini for directions to your destination, or get more info about it, and today, it's rolling out new features to help turn the chatbot into a (to borrow a term from Microsoft) copilot.With Gemini in Google Maps, you'll be able to ask open-ended questions and even have the AI take action for you, based on its responses. The idea is to make the app easier to work with while driving, which, yes, means you can also wake the bot with a simple \"Hey Google.\"Let's say you get peckish while driving. You'll be able to wake the bot with your voice, ask it for restaurants along your drive, and then have it alter your route to direct you to one of them. Or, if you have a passenger with you, they could also summon the bot with a Gemini icon in the top-right corner of the Google Maps screen.This is a major update compared to prior AI integration in Maps, which was mostly restricted to asking questions about certain routes or destinations before you started driving.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGemini will purportedly make Google Maps routes easier to followBut even if you're not actively talking to the AI to help you navigate, it'll still supposedly make Maps better for you. Rather than relying on generic instructions like \"turn right in 500 feet,\" Google says Maps will now also sometimes direct users by pointing out easy-to-spot landmarks along their route instead. That means you might get an instruction saying \"turn right after the Thai Siam Restaurant,\" with the restaurant itself being highlighted on your Maps app as you approach. To do this, the bot will cross-reference Google Street View photos with your route. I'll admit I'm a little skeptical that it might pick an easy-to-miss landmark—I don't trust myself to be able to spot the right restaurant while driving—but if it works, it could be more intuitive than trying to figure out how many feet are between me and my turn.Gemini will work with other apps from within MapsThere's also integration to help you better interact with Google's other apps while in Maps, like Calendar. The company says that, while talking to the bot about your route, you could also ping it to add an event to Calendar; assuming you've already given it permission to do so, it'll automatically follow through on your request. The company's also added a Google Lens button to Maps, so once you arrive at wherever you're going, you'll be able to point your phone at landmarks or your destination and ask Gemini for more details about them without having to leave Maps.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSmarter commutesOutside of connecting with other apps, Maps is also getting some of the same features as Waze, but with a twist. Google is adding a feature called Proactive Traffic Alerts to Maps, which sets Gemini to monitor disruptions to your most commonly traveled routes in the background. The idea is that you likely don't open Maps or Waze for your daily commute, which means you're not getting traffic alerts while you drive. Now, the AI will work for you while the app is closed, too, and will notify you on its own if it detects a crash or road closure while you're on one of your routine drives.The catch to all of this? There are plenty of ways it could go wrong, and there's no way to test it yet. Imagine the AI hallucinates a landmark that isn't there or has closed, and you miss a needed turn. In a roundtable with journalists (h/t The Verge), Google Maps product director Amanda Moore insisted that all training is \"using the actual place information in the real world\" and said \"there should be no hallucinations on places to stop at or things like that,\" but this is definitely something I'd want to try out first in a low stakes environment, rather than diving into it immediately on a cross-country road trip. (Even if a landmark is real, that doesn't automatically mean pointing it out will be useful.)When you can try Gemini in Google MapsUnfortunately, it'll take a little while before you can try out any of these new features. Gemini-based navigation starts rolling out \"in the coming weeks\" and Lens in Maps is set for \"later this month.\" Proactive traffic alerts and landmark-based navigation start their rollouts today, but it might still be a bit until they hit your iOS and Android device.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

For me, the vibe was utter relief. No one was being rude about sharing equipment, it didn't feel remotely competitive, and there was a safety and solidarity in being the only two women in that quadrant of the gym at that moment. For a brief window, the gym felt like a space for both catharsis and camaraderie. Unfortunately, this moment only made me realize how rare this sort of shared gym culture has become. Truthfully, I don't know if gym culture was ever for me. The stereotype is it's all bros, right? I'm no Joey Swoll, self-described \"CEO of gym positivity,\" one of those influencer types with a manic positivity that's either repellent or inspiring, depending on who you ask. As a casual gym-goer and as a woman, I've always felt the need to strike the perfect balance between exuding confidence and staying somewhat invisible. That's not exactly a recipe for community. So I could say a lot about what this piece is not about. It's not about \"being a woman\" and dodging sexual harassment. It's not about class studios, either, which have their own worlds and Pilates-based politics. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMy focus today is on something simpler and broader: the quiet disappearance of gym culture, and what's been lost as solo at-home workouts become increasingly high-tech and accessible. My job has deepened this strange distance. I spend my days testing the latest smart rowing machines, adjustable dumbbells, and stair steppers—equipment so sophisticated and convenient that the question isn't whether you can replicate a gym experience at home, but why you'd bother leaving at all. I've cycled through enough gear to outfit a small fitness studio, each piece promising to deliver professional results without the commute, the membership fees, or the potential for uncomfortable interactions. And it works. The technology is legitimately impressive. But something has been lost in this seamless transition to convenience. I write this now with a bit of a naive, romanticized gaze, wondering what life could've been like for me if I were a big, friendly man in the idealized gym culture of yore. From this vantage point, what is this ideal gym culture that I'm even imagining? And is it worth mourning something that may have never truly existed for everyone?The quiet disappearance of shared gym cultureAs smart home fitness tech increases, we're trading community for convenience, and we might not get it back. Echo Wang, a certified yoga teacher and founder of Yoga Kawa, says, \"the gym used to be a social anchor. People went not just to work out, but to belong.\" Now that home fitness equipment has made working out at home simple, that gym atmosphere is fading. Wang says that watching someone push themselves hard beside you provided extra motivation—it was infectious. Those conversations between sets kept people engaged, while exercising alone at home makes it simpler to skip workouts and lose momentum.Even those who still attend gyms exist in isolated worlds, noise-canceling headphones blocking out the sounds of clanking weights and ambient energy that once made gyms feel alive. Eye contact has disappeared, small talk has vanished—only repetitions and personal playlists remain. \"Convenience gets you going,\" Wang says, \"but being part of something keeps you coming back.\"Dr. Jesse Shaw, associate professor of sports medicine at University of Western States, says he built his training philosophy around competitive energy. From his military days through his current work in collegiate athletics, he's pursued being the biggest and fastest person in the gym—and when he wasn't, that drove him to train harder. He sees how home technology can fill this gap, pointing to how Peloton created a community and culture around their equipment that mimics this motivational aspect.But Shaw has also witnessed troubling changes. He's observed an unfortunate shift for dedicated gym-goers who want to focus on serious training without being filmed or waiting for someone to complete their \"workout\" content creation. As I recently covered, posting workouts online has become less about documenting personal progress and more about performing fitness for an audience—a shift that fundamentally changes the gym environment itself. The era of classic \"meat heads\"—big, burly people moving serious weight—has largely disappeared. Shaw also notes the changing group dynamics: During his military service, he was comfortable training alone and would simply ask someone nearby for a spot when needed. Now, he sees most people arrive in groups and tend to avoid lifting heavy weight efficiently.Shaw believes the at-home workout convenience that emerged from social and medical necessity remains a valuable exercise option. However, he's witnessed numerous gym closures due to weak attendance and poor recovery of membership numbers. Technology has altered both the pace and focus of current gym-goers, creating a need to document and share workouts online to feel a sense of accomplishment. Some home technologies, like Peloton, depend heavily on social features, building a culture and shared drive to improve and compete on leaderboards.The type of gym you go to mattersCost and type play a huge role in gym dynamics. My colleague Lindsey Ellefson shared how when she taught spin at the NYU community gym, which is free for students, she found the environment to be talkative, friendly, and wildly collegiate. But where she works now, a \"luxury gym,\" feels much more insular and everyone is kind of closed off. In the same vein, I spoke with a friend who has a gym in his apartment building, who told me how interacting with people you know are your neighbors can feel safer and easier compared to walking up to total strangers at a bigger establishment. For Kris Herbert, founder and owner of The Gym Venice, the cultural deterioration goes deeper. He's particularly concerned about low-cost, high-volume \"value\" gyms, where minimal financial and personal investment leads to vanishing individual responsibility. This lack of ownership creates spaces that are frequently dirty, disorganized, and dangerous. These gyms are places people use, rather than belong to.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHerbert has tracked a clear cultural transformation: People once trained together, spotted each other, and conversed between sets—now most members train in isolation, earbuds inserted, eyes averted. There was a time when entering the gym felt like walking into \"Cheers,\" where everyone knew your name. That community feeling has been largely replaced by convenience.Part of this shift stems from accessibility: Today, you can find answers to virtually any training question online without human interaction. While access to credible information can accelerate progress, it can't replicate the accountability, camaraderie, and shared energy of training with others.Herbert emphasizes that the social dimension of training is one of the most undervalued performance enhancers available. When you work out alongside others who notice your effort, encourage your development, and hold you accountable, you naturally push harder, maintain better consistency, and enjoy the experience more. That sense of belonging fuels not only better gym results but also enhanced mood, confidence, and overall mental health.How we can rebuild gym cultureTo rebuild this culture, Herbert suggests starting small. Introduce yourself to regulars, offer to spot someone, ask a question, acknowledge someone's consistency. These simple interactions remind us that fitness encompasses social, emotional, and deeply human elements beyond the physical. The gym should be somewhere people not only grow stronger but also belong.Smart fitness technology has made training more accessible—you can follow programs, track metrics, and receive feedback from your living room. But while this convenience eliminates friction, it also eliminates connection. The human elements of training—the cues, corrections, and shared energy—truly drive long-term progress and fulfillment. Smart technology might make working out easier, but it will never replace the power of human connection.I still test equipment at home. I still appreciate the convenience of rolling out of bed and onto a rowing machine without navigating complicated social dynamics or waiting for equipment. But I've started going back to the gym twice a week, trying to figure out what this whole gym culture thing could mean for someone like me.Maybe that ideal gym culture I'm imagining—the one where people belonged, where community thrived—was always more accessible to some than others. Maybe it was never perfect. But hey, even an imperfect community beats isolation. And maybe, if we're intentional about it, we can build something better than what came before—one shared set on the assisted pull-up machine at a time.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Last night, I was testing a pair of soon-to-be released display style glasses that blast out 1,200 nits of light. That’s roughly car-headlight-bright, squeezed into a postage-stamp-sized image projected on glass about a half inch from my eyes. I thought to myself, “Wait, am I frying my eyeballs?” So I called up Dr. Sunir Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at Wills Eye Hospital, and asked him point blank: What am I doing to my eyes with this stuff? “We think not much,” Garg replied. “If the light is not physically causing you to look away—if it’s a bright screen but it’s not uncomfortable—we don't think that that's going to cause any harm to the eye.”There’s not a ton of research on the long-term effects of VR headsets on vision, but the data out there isn’t raising alarms among eye professionals. According to the AAO, ophthalmologists agree that there is no reason to be concerned that VR headsets and/or smart glasses will damage eye health, function, or development. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo close the case, I asked Garg whether he’d ever seen or heard of any eye injuries from virtual reality, and he said, “The only scenario [in which] we've seen eye injuries is when people were doing something like boxing and tripped over the coffee table and fell down and hit their head.”How young is too young for using virtual reality? “But what about the children?” you might be asking (you hand-wringer, you). Good news there too: Virtual reality headset manufacturers may have age-based guidelines for their products—Meta recommends a minimum age of 10 years for its headsets, and Apple says its Vision Pro should not be used by children under 13—but they aren’t based on research about eyesight. “There’s not a lot of data that suggests that the VR headsets are problematic for kids,” Garg said. “I think we'll have to kind of hit [Meta and Apple] up for where that justification is coming from,” Garg said, ”because it's not something that we are really concerned about, per se.”There’s also no reason to think virtual reality helmets cause long-term vision problems in kids, but if a child is inside all day using VR, it could lead to nearsightedness. It’s not from the VR though—it’s the \"being inside\" part. “Something about being outside with natural sunlight seems to help regulate the growth of the eye and helps to reduce the amount of near-sightedness that people could be at risk of developing,” Garg said. So it seems there's some truth to the old trope of bookworms wearing glasses. Exactly why being an indoor-kid correlates with nearsightedness isn’t clear though; more research needs to be done. Virtual reality can cause eyestrain, thoughEven if VR gear and smart glasses don’t damage your eyes, they can still cause uncomfortable eyestrain. According to Garg, when you’re using VR or staring at any digital screen, your eyes are not moving much and you tend to blink less, so your eyes dry out, and that can lead to irritation and eyestrain.  “The fix for that is either moving your eyes around consciously, blinking a bit more consciously, or following the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s ’20/20/20 rule.’”  That is: When using any kind of screen, every 20 minutes you should look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.Motion sickness and dizziness in virtual reality Along with eyestrain, common pitfalls of using VR can include headaches, dizziness, and nausea. While your vision might have something to do with these things, the main cause of general VR sickness seems to be the inner ear, not the eyes. “Some people are just really sensitive to the motion component of virtual reality,” Garg said, “It's less clear to me how much of it is from the eyeballs.” Your eyes can handle 1,200 nits because they are toughTo sum up: Available evidence suggests your eyes will not be damaged if you go crazy with the VR, as long as you take breaks every once in a while and blink enough to avoid discomfort. It’s too late for us to save our 20/20 vision by soaking up more sunlight as a child, but at least we're not frying our eyeballs—and it’s reassuring to know that the biggest health risk from using virtual reality is barking your shins on the coffee table.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You download the apps you want to use, log into your accounts, and presto: You can stream anything with a few clicks of your remote. But smart TV apps aren't the only way people watch shows and movies on platforms like Netflix. Among other methods, like plugging a laptop directly into the TV, many people still enjoying casting their content from small screens to big screens. For years, this has been a reliable way to switch from watching Netflix on your smartphone or tablet to watching on your TV—you just tap the cast button, select your TV, and in a few moments, your content is beamed to the proper place. Your device becomes its own remote, with search built right-in, and it avoids the need to sign into Netflix on TVs outside your home, such as when staying in hotels. At least it did, but Netflix no longer wants to let you do it.\nNetflix no longer supports casting on most devicesWhile you can still cast to your TV from other streaming platforms, there's bad news for Netflix fans: The company has abruptly dropped casting support for most devices. Android Authority was the first to report on the change, though you might have stumbled upon the development yourself when looking for the cast button in the Netflix app. In fact, Netflix has prepared for your confusion, as you can see from this Netflix Help Center page titled \"Can't find 'Cast' button in Netflix app.\" This page might offer a glimmer of hope at first, as you think \"Oh good, Netflix has a solution if the Cast button is missing.\" Unfortunately, the response isn't going to make you happy: \"Netflix no longer supports casting shows from a mobile device to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. You’ll need to use the remote that came with your TV or TV-streaming device to navigate Netflix.\"The exception here is for \"older\" Chromecast devices or TVs that work with Google Cast—but only if you pay for an ad-free Netflix plan. If you took Netflix up on its lower-cost subscription offer, those ads not only cost you extra watch time, but also your ability to cast—assuming you even have the older hardware to cast to. While Android Authority was the first major publication to report on the issue, some Netflix casters have been living with the change over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 14, this user posted on the Chromecast subreddit voicing their complaints about the change. They were particularly frustrated with the lack of communication from Netflix, as the Cast button was removed \"with zero warning.\" Other users in the thread noted their frustrations, too, with some threatening to cancel their subscriptions over the issue.  Why is Netflix removing support for casting?Netflix doesn't explain why it's making the change, so I can only speculate. First, it's totally possible this is simply a tech obsolescence issue. Many companies drop support for older or underused technologies, and perhaps Netflix sees now as the time to largely drop support for casting. Streamlining the tech the app has to support means less work for Netflix developers, and it wouldn't be the first time the company dropped support for older platforms. However, that doesn't really explain why the company still supports some devices for casting. Maybe it took a look at its user base, and made the calculation that enough subscribers relied on Google Cast devices for casting, but not enough relies on newer hardware for casting. We might not really know unless Netflix decides to issue a statement.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, I can't help but feel like this is related to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing. The company clearly doesn't want you using its services unless you have your own paid account—or have another user pay extra to have you on their account. Casting, however, makes it easy to continue using someone else's account without paying for it. Since Netflix only requires mobile users to log into the account owner's home wifi once a month to continue watching on a device, you could theoretically cast Netflix from your smartphone to your TV to continue enjoying your shows and movies \"for free.\" By removing casting as an option for most users, those users will either need to connect a device to the TV by wire—like a laptop connected via HDMI—or log into the smart TV app. And if those users don't actually have permission to access that account via that app, they won't be able to stream. If this really is the company's intention, it's doing so at the inconvenience of paying users, too. If you're traveling, you now need to bother with signing into your account on a TV you don't own. If you don't like using your smart TV apps, you're kind of out of luck, unless you want to deal with connecting a computer to your TV whenever you want to catch up on Stranger Things. How to fix Netflix casting issues with compatible hardware If you do meet the new requirements for casting on Netflix, and the cast button still isn't appearing, Netflix does have some troubleshooting steps you can take on its Help Center page. It's device-dependent, but generally, here's what you should do:Check your Chromecast's wifi network: You can ensure your Chromecast is actively connected to your wifi network from the Google Home app on your iPhone or Android device. Turn your device off and on again: If you're casting from your phone or tablet, power it off completely, then turn it back on again. Turn your Chromecast off and on again: If your device boots back up but the Cast button is still missing, power off and unplug your Chromecast for at least 15 seconds before turning it back on again. Sign out of Netflix: Log out of Netflix on the device you're trying to cast from. Turn off Chrome extensions: If you're using Chrome on a Mac or PC for casting, Netflix recommends turning off your browser extensions. (This seems like an extreme step in my opinion, especially if you're someone who relies on Chrome extension—but if it works, it works.)    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Simply called YouTube Recap, this feature will break down your watching habits across all categories in 2025.According to YouTube, YouTube Recap will show \"a set of up to 12 different cards,\" with spotlights on \"your top channels, interests, and even the evolution of your viewing habits.\" It'll draw its data from both long-form and short-form videos as well as downloaded videos, but it'll only track videos you watched while signed in to your account.The company is also dividing its viewers into \"personality types\" based on what they watch, such as \"the Trailblazer\" or \"the Skill Builder.\" There's a whole breakdown of what these mean over on a support page, but as an example, if you're a \"Sunshiner,\" that means \"You're drawn to content that spreads positivity and good vibes.\" Google says that the most common personality types this year were \"the Sunshiner,\" \"the Wonder Seeker,\" and \"the Connector,\" and that personalities like \"the Philosopher\" and \"the Dreamer\" were more rare. So I guess you can brag about that if you get one of those.\nIf you listen to a lot of music on YouTube, meanwhile, YouTube Recap will also pull some data from YouTube Music, and can show you your top artists and songs of the year. For more detail, you'll need to visit the YouTube Music app and look at your YouTube Music recap proper.YouTube Recap should be available in North America starting today, although it might take some time until you see it—I can't seem to access mine yet. For global viewers, YouTube says it will \"roll out to the rest of the world this week.\" You'll be able to view it in 17 languages, with a full list available here.I'll keep checking for mine throughout the day, but for now, here's how to find your YouTube Recap once it goes live.How to view your YouTube RecapAccording to YouTube's instructions, YouTube Recap is available on both desktop and in the mobile app, and will show up as a banner either on your homepage or in your \"You\" tab. \nOn mobile, you can get to your \"You\" tab by tapping the button in the bottom-right corner with your profile picture on it, while on desktop, you'll need to click the \"You\" subheading in the pane on the left-hand side of your screen. Or, you can just navigate to youtube.com/recap and let your browser do the work for you (if on mobile, it'll direct you to the appropriate section of the app). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNote that you'll need to be signed in for any of this to work. You might also need to update your YouTube app if you're still having trouble. Google says you need version 18.43 or newer to see your Recap.Once you've viewed your recap, you'll also be able to share it, by tapping or clicking the Share button in any of your recap cards. Or, you can save it by tapping the download button to the left of the Share button.YouTube's most popular topics and creators in 2025\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: YouTube\n                    \n    \nAlongside YouTube Recap, YouTube has also released a more general look at trending topics, creators, and songs in 2025. The most popular topic in 2025 was apparently Squid Game, while MrBeast was the top creator (I have a feeling those might be connected). The Joe Rogan Experience is at the top of the podcast list, and interestingly, there are separate trending lists for shorts and full-length videos, with Forrest Frank's YOUR WAY'S BETTER topping Shorts and Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With a Smile taking the crown for full-length videos. KPop Demon Hunters is the only topic where you'll see overlap between the Shorts and full-length lists, with Soda Pop appearing on both.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We had new albums from Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Tyler the Creator, and, of course, Huntrix (of KPop Demon Hunters fame), just to name a few. You may have listened to any number of new albums that came out this year, mixed in with music that released any time over the last century. You might not even remember what you were listening to back in January. But Apple Music remembers, and will serve in up to you in your 2025 Apple Music Replay. Like last year, your Replay is available in your Apple Music app. If you're relatively new to the streaming service, that might sound obvious—especially if you've previously used a service like Spotify that offers a similar annual wrap-up. But this wasn't always the case: For much of Apple Music Replay's brief history, you had to visit a separate website, music.apple.com/us/replay, and log into your Apple Music account in order to access your recap. It seemed silly, considering Spotify Wrapped is very much an in-app experience, but it took Apple until 2024 to get with the program.That said, it seems Apple has made additional improvements this year. In 2024, the experience was essentially contained in an in-app browser, where it loaded your Apple Music Replay with the same UI as the website. This year, Replay is a native function of the Apple Music app, at least on iOS. \nHow to access your 2025 Apple Music Replay \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can still access your Replay from the official website, but the easiest way to review it is from the app on your iPhone or iPad. Open the app on your device of choice. Make your way to the Home tab if the app doesn't open there automatically, then tap or click on the large Replay option, which should appear at the top left. (This option also shows up in the Music app for Mac, but it will automatically direct you to the website in your browser.) Whichever way you access it, you'll be able to see all of your Replay months here (excluding December, of course, since the month just started), but let's focus on 2025 as a whole.Unpacking your Apple Music ReplayAt the top, you'll find a Replay your year in music tile. Tap Play Your Highlight Reel and Apple Music will walk you through your year. Here's what you can expect, at least based on my results: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you'll see your total listening minutes, complete with both a collage of the albums you listened to most, and one of your top-played songs playing in the background. Next, you'll see your top artist of the year, with a collage of their images and a relevant song playing in the background. The following slide is a breakdown of your top artist by monthThe next will show if any artist was your number one for multiple months. Next, you'll see the number of songs you listened to, complete with your top song of the year. Then you'll see the number of albums you listened to, and which one was your top choice. Second to last, Apple Music tells you your top genres of the year, including the one you listened to mostOne final slide summarizes the whole year.You don't have to watch the highlight reel to see these stats: Once out of the reel, you can scroll through the Replay page to see everything covered in the slides, plus additional stats. Mine shows top artists, songs, and albums by month—so I can see which artist defined March (Will Stratton), which song I listened to most in August  (\"The Subway\" by Chappel Roan), and which album I played on repeat in May (\"Tunnel Vision\" by Beach Bunny). I also see top playlists of the year; different listening milestones, like Minutes Listened, Artists Played, and Songs Played; stats from last year's Replay; and a playlist of my top songs of the year. Many of these stats, both in and out of the highlight reel, are easily sharable. You'll see a share icon next to any stat you can export, which makes it simple to share fun graphics with friends or on social media. I've already blown up the group chat with some of my stats here, and I expect many of you to do the same. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've always enjoyed keeping useful menu bar apps there, such as clipboard managers, app launchers, or apps that update other apps. But unfortunately, if you've installed more than a few third-party apps on your MacBook, your menu bar might be pretty cluttered. It's nothing a quick clean-up can't fix, though, and now macOS ships with a few ways to help fix your messy menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nJust as you'd remove unwanted items from your desk, you should periodically declutter the menu bar by removing apps that don't need to be there. This doesn't uninstall those apps, but it does free up some space in your menu bar. I do this for menu bar icons I never end up clicking. macOS 26 Tahoe has an easy way to remove apps from the menu bar. Follow these steps to do it:Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen.Go to System Settings > Menu Bar.In the right pane, navigate to the section called Allow in the Menu Bar.You'll see a list of apps that have a menu bar icon. You can uncheck any app you want to remove.Some apps also offer a way to remove their icons from the menu bar. Try checking your apps' settings to see if they let you remove their menu bar icons.\nNote that removing a menu bar icon for an app can sometimes cause the app to become \"headless,\" which means that it'll be running in the background but its icon won't show up in either the menu bar or the dock. This is fine for apps that you only need to configure once, but it can become a problem if you want to use the app regularly. In such cases, you can use a Spotlight search (Cmd + Space, or the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar) or alternatives such as Alfred or Raycast to search for the app's name and open it.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm sure you've noticed that the menu bar has more than just app icons. It's also home to the clock, wifi, volume controls, and more. You can easily add or remove these controls from the menu bar, as long as you're running macOS Tahoe. Here's how:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGo to System Settings > Menu Bar.Head over to the Menu Bar Controls section.Uncheck any control you want to remove from the menu bar.You cannot entirely remove the clock from the menu bar, but you can click Clock Options… and switch to Analog to make its icon a lot smaller.Drag and drop icons to rearrange the menu bar\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou also have the option of dragging and dropping your app icons around the menu bar, or using drag-and-drop to remove them from the menu bar. Just hold the Command key and drag any menu bar icon to a different position within the menu bar to rearrange it. To remove icons from the menu bar using drag-and-drop, hold Command and drag-and-drop them outside the menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTo tame the chaos at the top of your Mac's screen, I strongly recommend using a menu bar manager app. These apps will automatically show or hide menu bar icons based on triggers (eg: the battery icon will only show up when your MacBook's charge is below 25%), or add a second row of icons that's visible only when you click the menu bar. You'll need to try a couple of menu bar managers to decide which one works best for you.

I grew out of using my iPhone and Mac to read ebooks a few years ago, but I waited until this year to finally grab the e-reader I'd been eyeing since 2020. It's the Kindle Paperwhite, which I bought on discount a few months ago. I love it, which is why I'm happy to report that it's now on sale for Cyber Monday and is down to its lowest ever price.I know what you might be about to say, but buying a Kindle doesn't mean that you're forced to opt into Amazon's ebook ecosystem. I've successfully de-Amazoned my Kindle, and it's been going fine so far. You have lots of Amazon alternatives to buy ebooks, and I've made the most of the opportunity to read many of the DRM-free ebooks purchased over the years. The Kindle Paperwhite itself is a great device, too. It's quite snappy and doesn't show any performance issues even if you turn a lot of pages back-to-back.It's water-resistant, which means that you can use it by the pool, beach, or even while doing the dishes. And yes, there was a time when I got so locked into a book that I actually was reading the series even while doing the dishes. It was a bit annoying to stop and turn the page every minute or so, but the point is that I never worried about causing any water damage to my Kindle Paperwhite.Yes, there is a cheaper Kindle, too, but it lacks water resistance and has about half the battery life of a Paperwhite, which makes it less appealing to me. If you can afford to do so, I think buying the Kindle Paperwhite is the smart choice. But there still are a few more decisions to factor in. One is the color. The Paperwhite is available in black, green, and pink colors and all are currently at their lowest ever price. Once you've figured out your color, you need to choose if you're buying your Kindle with ads or ad-free. I always recommend spending the extra 20 bucks to get the ad-free version, but if lock screen ads don't bother you, then you can get the lower priced model.The third and final choice is whether you want to stretch your budget for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. This variant has 32GB of built-in storage (double that of the regular Paperwhite), an auto-adjusting front light, and support for wireless charging. It's just $5 more than the ad-free Kindle Paperwhite at time of writing, and it's worth remembering that this variant also doesn't have ads. Personally, I think the choice is really between an ad-supported Paperwhite at $125 or an ad-free Paperwhite Signature Edition at $150.

But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

By choosing to engage with the digital world, you often must give up your anonymity: trackers watch your every move as your surf the web and scroll on social media sites, and they use that information to build profiles of who (and where) you are and deliver you more \"relevant\" ads.It doesn't have to be this way. There are a number of tactics that can help keep your browsing private. You can use a VPN to make it look like your internet activity is coming from somewhere else; if you use Safari, you can take advantage of Private Relay to hide your IP address from websites you visit; or, you can connect the internet across a different network altogether: Tor.What is Tor?The whole idea behind Tor (which is short for The Onion Router) is to anonymize your internet browsing so that no one can tell that it is you visiting any particular website. Tor started out as a project of the U.S. Naval Research Lab in the 1990s, but developed into a nonprofit organization in 2006. Ever since, the network has been popular with users who want to privatize their web activity, whether they're citizens of countries with strict censorship laws, journalists working on sensitive stories, or simply privacy-focused individuals.\nTor is a network, but it's commonly conflated with the project's official browser, also known as Tor. The Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox that connects to the Tor network. The browser removes many of the technical barriers to entry for the Tor network: You can still visit your desired URLs as you would in Chrome or Edge, but the browser will connect you to them automatically via the Tor network automatically. But what does that mean?How does Tor work?Traditionally, when you visit a website, your data is sent directly to that site, complete with your identifying information (i.e. your device's IP address). That website, your internet service provider, and any other entities that might be privy to your internet traffic can all see that it is your device making the request, and can collect that information accordingly. This can be as innocent as the website in question storing your details for your next visit, or as scummy as the site following you around the internet.Tor flips the script on this internet browsing model. Rather than connect your device directly to the website you're visiting, Tor runs your connection through a number of different servers, known as \"nodes.\" These nodes are hosted by volunteers all over the world, so there's no telling which nodes your request will go through when you initiate a connection.But Tor would not be known for its privacy if it only relied on multiple nodes to bounce your traffic around. In addition to the nodes, Tor adds layers of encryption your request. When the request passes from one node to another, each node is only able to decrypt one layer of the encryption, just enough to learn where to send the next request to. This method ensures that no one node in the system knows too much: Each only knows where the request came from one step before, and where it is sending the request to in the following step. It's like peeling back layers of an onion, hence the platform's name. Here's a simplified example of how it works: Let's say you want to visit Lifehacker.com through Tor. You initiate the request as you normally would, by typing the URL into Tor's address bar and hitting enter. When you do, Tor adds layered encryption to your request. The first node it sends it to, perhaps based in, say, the U.S., can unlock one layer of that encryption, which tells the node which node to send it to next. The next node, based perhaps in Japan, decrypts another layer of that encryption, which tells it to send it to a third node in Germany. That third node (known as the exit node) decrypts the final layer of encryption, which tells the node to connect to Lifehacker.com. Once Lifehacker receives the request, the reverse happens: Lifehacker sends the request to the node in Germany, which adds back its layer of encryption. It then sends it back to the node in Japan, which adds a second layer of encryption. It sends it back to the node in the U.S., which adds the final layer of encryption, before sending the fully encrypted request back to your browser, which can decrypt the entire request on your behalf. Congratulations: You have just visited Lifehacker.com, without revealing your identity. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTor isn't perfect for privacyWhile Tor goes a long way to anonymizing your internet activity, it won't protect you entirely. One of the network's biggest weaknesses is in the exit node: Since the final node in the chain carries the decrypted request, it can see where you're going, and, potentially, what you're doing when you get there. It won't be able to know where the request originated, but it can see that you're trying to access Lifehacker. Depending on what sites you're accessing, you might give enough information away to reveal yourself.  This was especially an issue when websites were largely using the unencrypted HTTP protocol. If you connected to an unencrypted website, that final node might be able to see your activity on the site itself, including login information, messages, or financial data. But now that most sites have switched to the encrypted HTTPS protocol, there's less concern with third-parties being able to access the contents of your traffic. Still, even if trackers can't see exactly what you're doing or saying on these sites, they can see you visited the site itself, which is why Tor is still useful in today's encrypted internet.  Who should use Tor?If you've heard anything about Tor, you might know it as the go-to service for accessing the dark web. That is true, but that doesn't make Tor bad. The dark web is not inherently bad, either: It's simply a network of sites that cannot be accessed by standard web browsers. That includes a number of very bad sites filled with very bad stuff, to be sure. But it also encompasses a number of perfectly legal activities as well. Chrome or Firefox cannot see dark web sites, but Tor browser can. But you don't need to visit the dark web in order for Tor to be useful. Anyone who wants to keep their internet traffic private from the world can benefit. You might have a serious need for this, such as if you live in a country that won't let you access certain websites, or if you're a reporter working on a story that could have ramifications should the information leak. But you don't need to have a specialized case to benefit. Tor can help reduce anyone's digital footprint, and keep trackers from following you around the internet.One big drawbackIf you do decide to use Tor, understand that it won't be as fast as other modern browsers. Running your traffic through multiple international nodes takes a toll on performance, so you may be waiting a bit longer for your websites to load than you're used to. However, it won't cost you anything to try it, as the browser is completely free to download and use on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Android. (Sorry, iOS fans.) If you're worried about what you've heard about the dark web, don't be: The only way to access that material it is to seek it out directly. Otherwise, using Tor will feel just like using any other browser—albeit just a tad slower. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday or Cyber MondayWhen you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ \"Black Friday\" or \"Cyber Monday\" tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it's the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, impulse buyers may not fully realize what they're buying.How to tell if a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.To avoid a low-key scam, do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech.

Right now, Microsoft Visio 2021 Professional is on sale for just $10 for a lifetime license on StackSocial for new users. The deal runs through Cyber Monday. It’s priced low enough to justify adding to your digital toolbox, whether you use it often or just occasionally. It’s the same full version of Visio Pro, licensed for one Windows PC, no subscription required.Visio turns overwhelming data into clean visuals. Visio keeps things intuitive, whether mapping a new office layout, building org charts from Excel data, or sketching a workflow diagram with a stylus on your touch device. The interface is packed with over 250,000 shapes and templates (that aren't included in the web version), including standards-compliant options like UML 2.5 and BPMN 2.0. It’s more than just drawing boxes and arrows—it lets you link diagrams to live data and keep everything dynamic. It’s ideal for IT, architecture, business analysis, and other professionals who don’t want to start from scratch whenever they plan something out.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, it’s not the most plug-and-play experience for everyone. While the standalone license is solid, unlocking features like cloud collaboration, editing Power BI dashboards, or syncing with OneDrive requires additional Microsoft 365 subscriptions. If you're already in Microsoft’s ecosystem, this will slide right into place. If not, it could feel limited depending on how much integration you need. But this lifetime license offers an extremely cheap entry point into serious visual planning for single-PC users looking to diagram efficiently with powerful, pro-grade tools. Just be sure to redeem the code within 30 days, and make sure your system meets the basic Windows 10/11 or Server 2019 requirements.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

According to PCMag's review, it's a solid first-generation smart ring, though you'll get the most out of it if you have a Samsung phone.If you are already part of the Samsung ecosystem, this ring is great health and sleep tracker, monitoring metrics like heart rate, skin temperature, and sleep quality. However, if you're looking for detailed activity tracking, you're still better off with a smartwatch. This is more about passive health monitoring throughout your day and night.Design and featuresThe Galaxy Ring comes with a titanium finish in gold, silver, and black. Like Oura rings, it's a bit bulkier than a regular ring at 7mm wide and 2.6mm thick—something to consider if you're not used to wearing jewelry.Samsung users get extra perks: You can control your phone's camera or dismiss alarms by tapping your ring finger to your thumb twice in a row. It's a small touch, but these kinds of integrations make the device feel more seamlessly connected to your tech ecosystem.No subscription requiredHere's the biggest advantage over the main competition: The Galaxy Ring is subscription-free. Oura rings require an ongoing monthly fee to access your health data, but Samsung gives you full access without additional costs. That alone could save you hundreds of dollars over the ring's lifetime.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe ring is IP68 water resistant, so you can wash your hands and shower without worrying about it. It comes with a wireless charging case, and the battery lasts about six days per charge. Sizes range from five to 15, so most people should find a comfortable fit.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

If you are a runner, I know what you should tell your mom you want for Christmas. And even if there isn’t a gifting holiday in your immediate future, you should still know the Good News about water-resistant running shoes. They’re out there, they might be on sale right now, and they will change your life if you run in snowy conditions—or if you would if you had the right shoes.\nAs a lifelong on-and-off runner, I will say that running in the spring is a lot more fun if you don't have a long off-season every winter. So rather than from starting from scratch every year, it pays to keep putting in the miles through the cold and the rain and the snow. Maybe you don't run quite as often, and maybe you spend a little more time on the treadmill, but don't completely give up. I've written before about what to wear to run in the cold, focusing on things like jackets, gloves, and layering pieces. But I used to always forget about shoes. Whether it's snowy in your area or just rainy, keeping your feet warm and dry is a game-changer. \nAround this time last year,  my birthday was coming up and I had no idea what to tell my mom I wanted. (She kept asking.) I was giving the matter some thought while I was jogging at the local track, in a drizzling near-freezing rain, and my toes were going squish with every step. I suddenly remembered that Gore-Tex shoes exist. I had owned a pair years ago and loved them, but never replaced them when they wore out. They felt like too much of a luxury somehow. Most runners get through wet weather in regular shoes and wool socks, so why not make do?I’ll tell you why not: Wool socks can keep your feet warm, but they don’t keep them dry. If you’ve traveled to a park to get your run in, you’re driving home with soaking wet feet. You’ll come home, wring out your socks, and have to air out your shoes and hope they’re mostly dry by the time you go for your next run. Putting on wet shoes is about as much fun as putting on a wet bathing suit. Returning home from a drizzly run with dry feet is, by contrast, one of this cruel world’s great creature comforts. What weather are water-resistant shoes good for?Water-resistant shoes are great in drizzling rain, or in snowy conditions. In regular shoes, your body heat tends to melt any snow that contacts your shoes, making your feet wet even on a below-freezing day. Water-resistant shoes are great for when it’s snowing, when there’s a small amount of snow on the ground, or when it’s raining. This covers pretty much all of the weather I’m likely to consider running-friendly in a Pennsylvania winter.What don’t water-resistant shoes do?Water-resistant is not waterproof, though. In Gore-Tex and similar materials, you cannot step into an ankle-deep puddle and expect to stay dry. A heavy enough downpour will probably eventually work its way through or around the material. Note that water-resistant shoe material doesn’t stop snow or rain from getting into the top of the shoe. For trudging through deep snow, you probably want to attach a gaiter (or buy a shoe that comes with built-in gaiters). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd if you run in a variety of wintry conditions, you may want more traction on the bottom of the shoe as well. You can buy shoes with spikes built in, or add your own.  What are the best water-resistant running shoes?I know you’re dying to see mine, so here they are: the Nike InfinityRN Gore-Tex. (Mine are white.) I've only put about 200 miles on them since last year, since I wear other shoes in dry weather. That means that they're still in good condition to last another year.  \nBased on reviews, forum posts, and other things I’ve heard runners say about their favorite weatherproof shoes, I’ve collected some other excellent models to consider. For each, I’m linking one model, but click around to see its other colors, sizes, and men’s/women’s versions.Nike Pegasus Trail 5 Gore-TexSaucony Peregrine Ice+3 Hoka Clifton 9 GTX TSPuma Deviate Nitro 3 WinterizedBrooks Ghost 16 GTX\nNote that Gore-Tex is a name brand of breathable, water-resistant fabric, but other brands exist (for example, Saucony has their own, which they call Runshield). Gore-Tex is often abbreviated “GTX” in shoe model names, so consider looking for that when searching for shoes. And a bonus on many of these shoes is that they include high-traction outsoles to reduce the chances of slipping on wet surfaces. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

But that's only half of what makes these trackers useful, because also work in reverse: You can click a Mate and it will ring your phone in case you lose that.  A four pack of Mate trackers for $39.99 is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered, so this isn't an illusionary bargain, and it's much cheaper than Apple's competing product: A four-pack of AirTags lists for $99, and is currently on sale for $62.99. What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Normally $129.99, this home gym storage rack is currently on sale for $79.98. If you've been tripping over scattered dumbbells or wasting time hunting for the right weights mid-workout, this deal solves both problems for under $80.\nThis weight rack is specifically designed for a home gym. There are designated spaced for dumbbells, kettlebells, yoga blocks, resistance bands, medicine balls, and more—basically all the smaller equipment that tends to pile up in corners or get kicked under furniture. Having everything organized in one storage rack means you can actually find what you need when you need it.I recommend a dedicated storage rack like this so you can really focus on your fitness goals without the distraction of a cluttered space. In other words: No more digging through a heap of equipment or making multiple trips across your garage to grab different dumbbells between sets. Everything has its place, and you can grab what you need and get back to training.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

What are you putting all this time and effort (and money) into if it's not preparation for the future? One way you can do that is by using “elaborative interrogation,” a technique that helps you learn more effectively by challenging the facts you’re going over. Even if you do only want to pass a test, this can help you understand how the material's concepts relate to one another, which can help you remember them better ahead of exam day.What is elaborative interrogation?Inquiry is an important part of learning, which is why it’s fundamental to some of the best study methods, like SQ3R and KWL. Using those techniques, you outline what you may already know before you start studying, take a quick scan of the material to formulate questions that can guide your reading, then answer your own questions as you go. They're great techniques for making sure you stay engaged and curious, both of which help you focus and actually learn.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith inquiry in general, not only do you have to memorize what’s presented to you, but you have to dig in and understand it by asking questions. Like I said, when employing SQ3R or KWL, you ask questions before you start reading, so you can find the answers. When you try elaborative interrogation, you ask the questions as you go.Asking questions helps you find answers and establish connections that aren’t immediately apparent in the text, letting you more thoroughly understand what you’re going over. This concept makes sense: When your friend is telling you a wild story, you ask follow-up questions, right? When you ask questions, you're automatically more involved in the process of receiving information and you remember what you take in better because you're getting answers to the parts you were curious about.How to study with elaborative interrogationTo make this work for you, you need to assess the facts of your material. Say you’re studying accounting. One fact you’ll learn is that you journalize debits before credits. You can get by and do well enough on tests just by knowing that fact without thinking any deeper about it—but if you really want to understand the material, it would be helpful to figure out why you journalize debits before credits. When doing elaborative interrogation, you ask yourself these kinds of questions after looking at your facts, so you fully grasp the meaning of it all. Here, your elaborative interrogation is, “Why do we journalize debits before we journalize credits?” Your next question can be, “Why do we record debits as a positive number?” The reason it’s done this way is to reflect incoming money more easily on the credit side.You can even go deeper by working backwards: Why do accountants journalize? What do accountants journalize? Who sees the accountant's journal? What is included in an accountant's journal entry? What are debits? What are credits? Why are they journalized? When are they journalized? The more you understand about the core concept, the more questions you can ask, and the more you can grasp the primary fact, which is that you journalize debits before credits. Eventually, the reasoning for why debits are journalized before credits will be so obvious that the fact itself will be more than obvious. Of course that's the order you do it in, and if that order is all you need to know for your test, you're golden. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo, start by identifying the basic facts you need to know. You can do this easily by writing them down as you go through your text, notes, or lecture. Any assertion or basic fact makes the cut. You can also try using AI, like Google's NotebookLM or ChatGPT, to generate facts. As a test, I just asked ChatGPT, “What are some basic facts to study for accounting?” It gave me 16, almost all of which are great for elaborative interrogation. For instance, the software told me that the International Financial Reporting Standards are used in many countries for financial reporting. That’s probably an answer to a question on a test on its own, but to really understand the point of it all, I could ask, “Why do countries need a set of accounting standards? Which countries use the IFRS?” If you're using ChatGPT or similar, just make sure it’s giving you actual facts; look them up to be sure they’re true. Better yet, use the other tool I mentioned, NotebookLM, because it pulls only from material you provide. Upload your course materials—slide decks, chapter scans, handouts from the professor, whatever—and ask it to pull out the key facts. You can also use the software to generate flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and informational podcasts, but those are for different study approaches entirely. (Try them out when you're done elaborately interrogating!)On a separate paper, write down these questions about your facts, then set to work investigating the answers. The answers may come from materials outside your class lecture, notes, or texts, so don’t be afraid to dig deep. For the most part, though, do try to stick with what you've been provided unless the professor has instructed you to look elsewhere on your own. Ultimately, getting the answers to these questions will help you establish the  connections you need to truly grasp the material and remember it well. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Researchers have demonstrated a new type of malware attack that can steal sensitive information from Android devices—including Google and Samsung phones—without the knowledge or action of the target user. The attack is called \"Pixnapping,\" an apparent portmanteau of \"pixel\" and \"snapping.\" When you download and open a piece of software containing the malware, the app scans your phone for specific apps it might want to spy on. It then accesses another app on your phone—say, Google Authenticator—but rather than open it, it pulls the information that would be displayed into the Android rendering pipeline. From there, the app scans the display information for individual pixels, targeting areas known to contain sensitive information. In the case of Google Authenticator, the focus is on the pixels known to contain the 2FA codes within the app. The malware then checks to see whether a pixel is blank, or contains some type of rendered content. It uses these findings to recover the original images, like a complete 2FA code, without ever actually having seen the original images in the first place. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis process can repeat for as long as it takes to scan the stolen pixels and pull the original information from them, all without you knowing it's happening. Researchers compare the process to taking screenshots of screen contents the malware should not have access to.How the malware worksThere are three reasons Pixnapping attacks are possible on Android, according to researchers. First, the OS allows apps to send another app's activity to the Android rendering pipeline, which allows the malicious app to invoke sensitive activities, like refreshing 2FA codes. Second, apps can run graphical operations on pixels displayed through another app's activity, which is how the malicious app can pull pixels from something like Google Authenticator. Third, apps can measure the pixel color-dependent side effects of those operations, which allows the malicious app to leak the pixel values.Researchers demonstrated these Pixnapping attacks on Google and Samsung phones, including the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Galaxy S25. These phones were running Android 13, 14, 15, and 16. Researchers say they aren't sure if other types of Android devices are affected by this attack, though the \"core mechanisms\" involved are usually present in all Android devices. Different Pixel devices had different rates of success in the 2FA hack (73%, 53%, 29%, and 53% for the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively), though researchers could not obtain 2FA codes on the Galaxy S25 within the 30 second timeline before the codes refreshed.  In addition to devices, researchers demonstrated Pixnapping attacks on sites and services like Gmail, Google Accounts, Signal, Google Authenticator, Venmo, and Google Maps. The implication is that this type of attack could steal many different types of information from your phone, including emails, encrypted messages, payment records, and location histories.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAccording to the findings, Google has tried to patch Pixnapping, but researchers were able to workaround this patch in demonstrated attacks. The vulnerability is currently tracked as CVE-2025-48561. Google is working on a new patch for the December Android security builtin. How to protect yourself from PixnappingThe good news, at this time anyway, is that researchers are not aware of Pixnapping attacks happening in the wild. However, that doesn't mean they won't happen, especially now that the attack has been disclosed. The first thing to do to protect yourself is to make sure you're running the latest security patches on your Android device. While Google is still working on a subsequent Pixnapping patch, there is a patch in existence. Make sure you install it on your phone by heading to System > Software updates.Next, be cautious with the apps you download on your device. Always try to download apps from trusted and verified marketplaces, as it's much more difficult for bad actors to hide malware on apps distributed through these stores. Even when you download apps on something like the Google Play Store, investigate the app thoroughly: Ensure it's really the app you think it is, and it's coming from the developer that makes it. If you sideload apps, be careful with what you download, and only install apps from developers you trust.   \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the weekend, multiple Reddit users complained that their Pixel 10 phones, which only just hit the market in August, were already facing severe slowdowns and frequent crashes while trying to load apps. Worse yet, the problem seemed to persist across all apps and models of the phone, leaving users with little they could actually do on their new devices. \"If an app does open and load it won't let me touch anything and it crashes,\" user cdriese said, with a number of others sharing a similar sentiment.The unfortunate news took me as a bit of a surprise, since I experienced no such issues while reviewing the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro at launch, both of which I quite liked. But the problem, it seems, only popped up recently. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMultiple users across Reddit pointed to October 10's Google Play Services update as the culprit here, with some saying that uninstalling the update fixed the problem for them. \"My running theory is that the October play services update is clashing with the September Android OS update in some way,\" said user PuzzleHeadedSquid, adding that they have had no crashes since uninstalling the Play Services update. Sure enough, when I loaded my phone with both the September Android OS update and the initial October play services updates installed, I also started to have issues.In a way, though, that's still a relief. Your new hardware isn't broken already—but uninstalling the new Play Services update introduces its own headaches. Luckily, as of this morning, there's another solution, and it's pretty simple.If you're experiencing crashing apps on your Pixel 10, here's what you can do.The official fixRandom Reddit users weren't the only folks experiencing this problem. Android Police founder Artem Russakovskii also called out the problem in an October 12 X post, saying his Pixel 10 Pro XL had been \"kneecapped\" by it.\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nLuckily, as a member of the press, he had a bit more resources at his disposal for fixing this bug than the average Redditor. Over the course of the weekend, Russakovskii quickly got in touch with his contacts at Google, who he says scrambled multiple teams to address the issue and has since issued a server-side fix.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTheoretically, that means a simple restart should bring your phone back to normal, although if the problem persists, you'll also want to make sure you're running the most recent Google Play services build (which you can check under Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details), then do another restart.It's a pretty quick turnaround on a fix, and doesn't require much on your part, but if you've temporarily shelved your Pixel, it's worth booting it back up again to see if you're still having issues.The unofficial fixThat said, it's possible Google's engineers still might have missed something. If you still find yourself having issues loading apps, you can use the community method of uninstalling the October Play Services update instead. This will log you out of your Google accounts, however, and won't include Google's official fix, so I'd only recommend it in an emergency.That said, if you're at the point of pulling your hair out, you can navigate to Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details and tap \"Remove updates\" to start the process. Just be sure to have your Google passwords (or passkeys!) memorized first.First, though, try hitting the \"Update\" button next to it instead, then restarting your phone. That's what I did, after initially running my testing without this morning's update, and my apps are now as snappy as ever.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.If you have a Premium Family plan through Spotify, there's good news: You can now set up managed accounts for your kids. Not only can you control what they listen to, their music choices won't reflect in or affect your listening history. Congratulations: You're getting your Wrapped back.    On Tuesday, Spotify announced it is rolling out managed accounts for Premium subscribers to seven new regions: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Premium Family subscribers in these countries can now create managed accounts for users younger than 13 that allow those users to listen on their own, in a controlled environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nManaged accounts are music-only, so younger listeners can't browse Spotify's other offerings, such as podcasts, or send or receive DMs. In addition, account managers can control a number of settings on these accounts, including whether the account can listen to explicit music, choose to block specific artists and songs, and decide to hide video—including short-form Canvas content.While Spotify has an existing service designed for children, Spotify Kids, it's much different, as it only contains music hand-picked for the service, and doesn't allow subscribers to control the account. Managed accounts allow subscribers to give a full Spotify experience to their kids, while having total control over what they can listen to. Personally, I think this is a fantastic feature. As someone who grew up in the early days of iTunes, I would have loved the ability to add whatever songs I wanted to my playlists—assuming my parents gave those songs the OK, of course. It's also great that kids can get recommendations for new music from Spotify. If they are obsessed with the latest trending song, perhaps Spotify can recommend similar tunes, both contemporary tracks as well as classics. It could be a great way to expand kids' music tastes.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify first tested managed accounts in 10 other countries: New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Columbia. It's now available as part of its Premium Family plan, which costs $19.99 per month.   How to create a managed accountIf you're using the Spotify mobile app, head to Settings and privacy > Account > Premium Family. If you're on your account page on Spotify's website, choose \"Manage members.\" Either way, under Plan members, choose to add members to your plan. Choose \"Add a listener aged under 13,\" then choose \"Add account.\"You'll then follow the on-screen steps to confirm you are the parent or guardian of the listener; set a PIN to control the experience; choose the name and birthdate of the listener; and choose your settings. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

No longer do big ideas like \"we never went to the moon\" unite the dumbest minds; instead, the algorithm creates bespoke conspiracy theories. So instead of joining the Flat Earth Society, you might think the actual year is 1728, or that AI secretly imagined a British comedian from the the 1980s and seeded the web with evidence of his existence.But how does it start? And how quickly can social media platforms transform someone from a person from a seeker-of-knowledge to a believer-in-bullshit? YouTuber Benaminute recently posted a video where he dug in to find out. His question: If you start with a benign, broad, randomly chosen subject, and you only watch videos having to do with that subject, how long will it take until TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels feed you a conspiracy theory video? The answer: not long at all. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDifferent topics all lead to the same place (more or less) For the experiment, Benaminute created \"blank\" social media profiles and behaved like someone who was innocently curious about one of three topics—dinosaurs, The Vietnam War, and the 2000 presidential election. He put the keyword in each platform's search bar and only watched and liked videos about the initial subject. DinosaursYouTube Shorts: The initial videos were ads for Jurassic Park, AI slop featuring dinosaurs, and the occasional educational video, but the 541st video was a clip from the Joe Rogan Experience about how the pyramids were not tombs, but \"DNA restoration devices.\"TikTok: If you thought TikTok would get to conspiracy theories quickly, you'd be right. The 144th video was this fake UFO video that has 24 million views. Instagram Reels: Insta took 661 videos to get from dinosaurs to a \"forbidden phone from the 2000s that lets you see into a parallel dimension.\"The Vietnam WarThings get worse for people interested in historical or political events. On all short-form platforms, an interest in Vietnam will lead you pretty quickly to right-leaning content, which leads you to conspiracy theories. YouTube Shorts got to a conspiracy theory video about Noah's Ark in only seven videos. TikTok took a little longer; video 161 was about how financial services company Blackrock had something to do with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Reels took 139 videos to get to \"Bush did 9/11.\" The 2000 electionThe election of 2000 is still a charged topic, but it's been awhile, so maybe cooler heads and verified information will win the day? Spoiler: nope. YouTube Shorts took 136 videos to get to the same Noah's Ark conspiracy as it did for dinosaur fans.TikTok only took 38 videos to get to \"The Rapture is happening on September 24.\"Reels took only 26 videos to land on \"The World Trade Center was bombed\" (by either Clinton or Bush). Which social media app leads to conspiracy theories fastest?The champion of \"normal search to conspiracy theory\" speed runs is TikTok, with an average of 114 videos or 57 minutes of watching. YouTube Shorts comes in second with 230 videos or 1 hour 57 minutes of time, and Reels takes 275 video or 138 minutes. It's a distinction without a difference; however, all three platforms lead to conspiracies in the time it takes to watch a Marvel movie. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does it all mean? It would be easy to conclude that the massive tech companies that built YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok companies weight their recommendation engines so viewers are led to fake stories. Maybe they have specific political aims and are trying to sway votes, or maybe (as Benaminute posits in a semi-tongue-in-cheek way) these apps are built to \"keep us angry, divided, and distracted\" from realizing the conflict isn't between Left and Right, but between \"up and down.\" This is also a conspiracy theory, however. I'm not saying he's wrong, but we don't have enough information to know why algorithms recommend conspiracy content. It could be because bad actors at the top demand specific results for some purpose, but it seems more likely to me that TikTok et al. don't have an agenda beyond making money.\\I have no doubt that a social media platform featuring an algorithm that weighs the truth heavily would fail pretty quickly; the Truth is boring compared to conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories, broadly, make believers feel special, like they have inside knowledge the rest of us lack. People scroll TikTok to have fun; the truth usually isn't fun.  Conspiracy theorist can say things like \"UFOs are here!\" or \"They're turning the frogs gay!\" Meanwhile, if you're devoted to the truth, you mostly have to go with \"the best evidence suggests...\" or \"it seems logical that...\" and who wants to hear that?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's official: As of Tuesday, Oct. 14, Microsoft no longer supports Windows 10. That said, if you powered on your Windows 10 PC this morning, only to read headlines suggesting the end of Windows 10, you might be a bit confused. Your computer still works, after all. So what's really going on here?What Windows 10 end of life really meansAs it might now be evident, Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 doesn't mean the company has shut down the OS for good. Any devices still running Windows 10 will continue to run—and, in fact, much in the same way as they previously have. You probably won't notice any difference between Windows 10 on Oct. 14 vs. Oct. 13.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe issue isn't that Windows 10 won't work going forward; rather, it's that Microsoft will no longer issue security updates to Windows 10 users by default. That means the next time someone discovers a security vulnerability with this OS—no matter how big or small it may be—Microsoft will not send a patch to most Windows 10 users. The risk of using Windows 10 going forward starts small, and escalates quickly. It's only day one of Windows 10's end of life, which means there's little risk in using the OS today. However, over time, more and more security vulnerabilities will surface. Soon enough, there will be a real danger in using a Windows 10 PC that is connected to the internet. All it takes is clicking one malicious link in a spam email, or downloading malware disguised as legitimate software, for hackers to strike. Windows 10 extended security updatesHere's the thing, though: Between users who can't or don't want to update to Windows 11, as well as organizations that rely on Windows 10 to run specific programs and services, there are still a lot of Windows 10 machines out there. If you're running Windows 10, you aren't alone—some estimates put the OS' market share at 40.5% of all Windows machines. Sure, there are more PCs out there running Windows 11, but there could be roughly half a billion users that just lost official support from Microsoft. Microsoft knows this, which is why this \"end of life\" isn't really the end for Windows 10. The company offers Windows 10 users the option of enrolling in Extended Security Updates, or ESU. Under the ESU program, you'll still receive critical security patches, even when using Windows 10. It does feel like Microsoft is soft launching Windows 10's demise, but at least all Windows 10 users have an option to continue using the OS securely. However, you can't just expect Microsoft to automatically enroll your PC in the ESU program. You have one of three options here, two of which are free:Pay a one-time $30 fee.Opt into Windows Backup to sync your PC to the cloud.Redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.You'll find these options your PC after updating to the latest possible version. From here, head to Settings > Windows Update, and look out for the \"Windows 10 support ends in October 2025\" and \"Enroll in Extended Security Updates to help keep your device secure\" options.Be warned, however, that Microsoft does not see this as a long-term solution. This is still part of the Windows 10 end of life plan, after all. The ESU program only lasts from Oct. 15 of this year through Oct. 13, 2026. After that date, Microsoft will stop issuing Windows 10 security updates for good. In addition, you will only receive security patches: no features, design changes, or tech support.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUpdating to Windows 11Whether it's today or Oct. 13 of next year, it won't be safe to run Windows 10 on an internet-connected PC without these security patches. As such, your only option for using Windows in the future is by upgrading to an OS Microsoft actively supports. At this time, that means Windows 11. That doesn't necessarily mean buying a new PC though, as Windows 11 might be compatible with your current machine. Here's are the minimum hardware requirements, as noted by Microsoft:Processor: 1 GHz or faster with at least two cores on a 64-bit chipMemory: 4GB or moreStorage: 64GB or moreGraphics card: Compatible with DirectX 12 or later, with a WDDM 2.0 driverTPM: Trusted Platform Module version 2.0 Display: 720p or higher, nine inches or larger, with 8 bits per color channelYour Windows 10 PC must also be running Windows 10 version 2004 or later, and you'll need to at least be running the Sept. 14, 2021 security update.While many of these requirements seem pretty basic, the one that trips up many otherwise capable machines is TPM 2.0. This is a security standard that can help prevent modern cyberattacks on Windows, so it's great to have. However, if you have a PC older than 2016, it might not have TPM 2.0. Your computer might very well be capable of running Windows 11, but Microsoft won't endorse it if you don't have this security hardware in place. Even still, you can go around Microsoft to install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC. Just note Microsoft does not approve of this, and may even stop supporting your PC if you choose this route—defeating the purpose of upgrading from Windows 10 in the process.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. A number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That’s because the platform is trying to up engagement on posts with links in them, by keeping the like, comment, repost, favorite, and share buttons active in a new footer even when you click through to an outside article.When you click on a link in X, it doesn’t actually navigate away from the app, but instead uses a special version of either Chrome (on Android) or Safari (on iPhone) to open the article within X. That hasn’t changed. But what has is that, on iPhone, you’ll now continue to see interactable elements at the bottom of the page, with buttons you can press to engage directly with X while reading. Also, when you first access a link or scroll up, you’ll even see part of the original social media post that drove you there above those buttons. These elements will remain even if you click another link in the article you’re reading.It’s a small change despite maybe looking a little busy, but it points to a potential fix for a major problem. According to X head of product Nikita Bier, the idea is to try to increase traffic for posts with links in them, by making it easier for users to engage with them even after clicking through.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nA lot of controversy has been made about X posts that include links getting less traffic than those that don’t, especially after the platform was acquired by current owner Elon Musk. While the site hasn’t admitted to it directly, SEO experts have recently started warning users to avoid putting links in their traffic, claiming that X now deprioritizes posts with links on them, as they keep people away from their timelines. Musk has also made comments that some have accused of implying this to be the case.Bier, however, refuted this while debuting the new interface for opening links on iOS, instead saying “links are not deboosted,” and implying that the lack of interactable timeline elements on them simply leads to less engagement naturally, something the new change is trying to fix.For instance, the old method of opening links could potentially draw you away from the site and interrupt any intention you had to reply to the original social media post or share it to your own audience. Bier said this is what led to posts getting lower reach, and that the new footer should help them “get better signal.”But at the same time, it’s clear that the new approach has benefits for X as well, since it gives users easier avenues to navigate away from external articles and back to their timelines, where they can drive engagement on other posts and see ads.But regardless of whether X manually deprioritizes posts with links, or if the motivations for the change are selfish, the fact that changes like this are even being made means the platform might finally start trying to make linking in posts more viable. That could be a huge boon for users like myself, who have historically used X (and Twitter before it) to help drive traffic to our posts. Whatever the reason this stopped working, it would be helpful for those who rely on it if it were fixed.That said, there’s a chance you might not be seeing the new interface at all, or that if you are, you might not like it. Luckily, if that sounds like you, you’re not out of options.X Links only look different on iPhone, for nowIn the post announcing the change, Bier mentioned that the “new link experience” is only in testing, and that it’s only on iOS at the moment. That means that, while I do currently see it on posts I’m opening with my iPhone 15 Pro, you might not. On my Pixel 10, I’m still getting the old interface, and even on iPhone, it doesn’t seem to be affecting all users. My husband, for instance, is not seeing the footer on his iPhone 17 Pro. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat’s great news if you don’t like the look of the new footer, although if you would like to try it out, I unfortunately don’t have much advice at the moment. It seems only some users have access to it right now.However, if you are seeing the new footer but you would prefer not to, there are two steps you can take to get rid of it.How to open X links without the new footer\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe change to how X links work is server-side, so downgrading your app or avoiding an update won’t save you here. Instead, to get rid of the footer from links you open in X, you’ll need to first open the link, then hit the three-dots button just above the footer on the right-hand side.From there, you’ve got two options. First, to open the page with its formatting intact but no footer, tap “Open in browser.” This will open the link in your default browser, but also take you to that browser’s app instead, meaning you’ll have to find your way back to the X app if you want to keep scrolling once you’re done reading.To stay in the X app, you can take advantage of Safari’s reader mode, which will still be available to you even if Chrome or another app is your default browser. In the same three-dot menu, simply tap “Show Reader” instead, and you’ll see a plain version of the link with all website formatting stripped out, including the X app’s new footer, all without having to move to a new app. To return to the normal view, just tap the X button in the top left corner. Then, to go back to your X timeline, either grab the footer and scroll up, or tap the X button just above the footer on the left-hand side.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.Against all cybersecurity advice to the contrary, right next to my computer is a piece of paper with the password to my Google account written on it. Why? Well, if I forget it, what am I gonna do? Send a recovery email to my Gmail that I can't log into? It seems Google's aware of that little problem, because while it does have other workarounds on its account recovery page (like providing a mobile number that you've hopefully already linked to your account), now it's letting you use your friends' and family's emails to help you recover your Google accounts instead.Google is calling these emails \"Recovery Contacts,\" and you can set them up now. Just navigate to your Google Account's security settings (or click here) to get started. From the Recovery Contacts page, click the button to add a contact, then enter someone you trust (you'll see several suggestions) and send them a request to be a Recovery Contact for you. Once they accept it, they'll be able to help you get your account back if you ever find yourself unable to log in, but they'll have to jump through a few hoops that a normal recovery email wouldn't.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFirst, a Recovery Contact only has seven days to accept your invite, so if they missed your initial request, you'll have to send it again. Second, if they decline your request for whatever reason, you'll have to wait four days before you can send them a new one. Third, once they've actually accepted your request, you'll need to wait seven more days before they can actually help you recover your account.But once your friend or family member is set up as a Recovery Contact for you and through the waiting period, there are only a few steps left. It's not quite as convenient as a standard recovery email, but it's close. When trying to recover your account, select your recovery contract from the list of recovery options, or follow a prompt Google says may pop up to reach out to them. Then, select Get number. Your recovery contact will then get an email with three different numbers on their device. Give them the number you got within 15 minutes, have them select it, and you should be able to get back into your account on your own device. Or, if you missed that time window, you can simply get another number to try again.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNote, though, that like with other recovery methods, Google might require additional case-by-case verification that you are who you say you are. The company says that if this is the case, your account will be put on a temporary security hold, and you'll be notified that an account recovery request was made. It's a bit annoying, but the idea is that if someone else tries to use your recovery contact , you'll be able to deny them access to your account. Given that one of the steps here simply requires a 1/3rd chance guess, I suppose that makes sense. It's still more secure than my piece of paper.And speaking of security, if you ever find yourself not trusting a Recovery Contact as much as you once did, you can easily remove them from your list. Navigate to your Google Account's Security & sign-in page, then tap Recovery contacts, hit the Trash icon next to the account you want to remove, and hit Confirm. Note that a Recovery Contact won't get your standard security alerts or notifications, but it's still good practice to remove them if you no longer trust them.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's the end of an era: TiVo no longer manufactures or sells the DVRs that made the company a household name. If you still have one, the company will continue to support it, but don't go looking for one: TiVo as we know it is effectively over.TiVo didn't make a big deal about this discontinuation, however. As it happens, Luke Bouma of Cord Cutter News was the first to spot the development. Earlier this month, Bouma reported that TiVo Corporation had silently ended its DVR line, removing all references to the devices on its website. Following Bouma's reporting, TiVo's parent company, Xperi, confirmed the news.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn a statement to PCMag, an Xperi spokesperson said: \"I can confirmed that as of [Oct.] 1, 2025, TiVo stopped selling physical DVR products, including hardware and accessories, both online and through agents...TiVo no longer manufacturers hardware, and our remaining inventory is now depleted, though we will continue to offer support for the products going forward.\" TiVo isn't gone entirely. The brand now develops both TiVo OS, a smart TV operating system similar to Roku OS or Fire OS, as well as DTS AutoStage Video Service, an entertainment service developed for cars. But it is no longer a DVR manufacturer or seller, which might shock a time traveler from the early 2000s.The TiVo effectTech comes and goes, but if you weren't watching TV in the late '90s and early 2000s, you might not know how monumental TiVo really was. The company launched its first DVRs in 1999 and introduced the market to features like one-touch simple recording, a hard drive to save multiple recordings at once, and, perhaps most notably, the ability to \"pause\" live TV and fast forward through commercials. The DVR offered viewers so much more than a simple VCR could, which only allowed for linear recording to single cassettes. TiVo could record live video from any input, including analog, cable, or satellite, which offered users flexibility in the content they recorded.Before TiVo, if you missed the start of a show, you simply had to deal with it and try to jump in as best as you could—assuming you didn't set a VCR to record it, of course. If you had a TiVo, however, you could simply rewind to the start of the program, and, when you reached a commercial break, skip ahead back to the show—until you caught up with the live broadcast. TiVo disrupted the way consumers watched TV, and we're likely seeing the ramifications of that today. The market adapted, and cable companies started offering their own DVRs with cloud-based recording as opposed to hard drive recording. Streaming services built on that momentum: Viewers were already getting used to watching shows whenever it suited them, so why not get ahead of the game, and offer all shows on-demand at any time? There's no need to choose which programs to record: Everything is available at any time. Like other early technology pioneers that fell behind with time, TiVo struggled through the streaming age it arguably helped create. The company hasn't released a DVR since 2019, when it launched the TiVo Edge. That DVR had support for modern features, like 4K Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos sound, and access to major streaming apps, in addition to recording live TV. It then tried to break into the streaming device market with the TiVo Stream 4K, but the competition was too fierce to make an impact. In a twist of irony, as TiVo discontinues its DVRs, streaming services are turning to ad-supported plans with increasing frequency. TiVo changed the game by letting us skip ads, and streaming originally omitted the ads entirely. But more and more customers are comfortable paying less to deal with commercials. We've come full circle in a way. TiVo's time might be at an end, but its impact lives on. What Skype did for video calls, TiVo did for TV. I'll be thinking about that the next time I boot up something to watch on Netflix or Hulu.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

According to a recent post on the website formerly known as Twitter, the company will soon start selling “handles that are no longer in use” to paying subscribers.The feature, called the X Handle Marketplace, is currently only being teased, but a waitlist for it is live. Once active, it’ll allow X Premium+ subscribers (at the $40/month level) and Premium Business accounts to both request free (with their subscription, at least) handles, and directly purchase especially rare ones.Rare usernames could cost $2,500 or moreAccording to an FAQ page, pricing for rare handles starts at $2,500 and could go “over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.” You’ll also need an invitation to even be allowed to purchase a paid username, although receiving the complimentary handles also comes with complications.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFor free handles, there are two types. The standard ones, called “priority handles,” are open for any eligible subscriber to request; X says it will usually review requests within three business days, although not all requests will be approved. But X also says it will occasionally drop select rare handles (the type it would usually charge for) as part of free giveaways, where multiple subscribers can apply for the handle and a winner will be selected “based on merit.”As for what X considers “merit” to be, that would include past contributions to the site, intended usage for the handle, as well as engagement and reach on the platform.Once you’ve got a new handle, your current username will be locked so others won’t be able to change it, and your page’s @ will change to the new one. X also says it may offer paid redirects from old usernames to new ones in the future.Note, though, that if you got your new handle for free, you’ll need to stay subscribed to keep using it. Users who paid for their handles will be able to let their X subscriptions lapse without losing them.What handles X will be giving out for freeAs for what type of inactivate handles X will be giving out, the site has provided a few examples. Generally, paid handles will be pithy, one word, “culturally significant names,” like @Pizza or @Tom. Meanwhile, free ones are more likely to be full names or multi-word phrases, like @GabrielJones or @PizzaEater. As someone who doesn’t subscribe to X, it’s the full names that have me concerned—and the ones I’d suggest logging into your account to preserve. Part of the reason I haven’t deactivated my X account yet is because I don’t want someone else to be able to make an account with my username, which is a variation on my full given name. I don’t post on it very often, but I’d rather others not be able to easily masquerade as me.With that in mind, I’ve reached out to X to ask how the website will decide when to make “inactive” usernames available to request, and will update this post when I hear back. X’s inactive account policy says that users should log in “at least every 30 days” to keep their accounts active, though, so if you’re concerned about your username being taken, it’s best to play it safe.To be fair to X, redistributing usernames from inactive accounts is not an unheard of practice for social media sites, although charging for them is a bit novel. X says the reason it’s requiring a subscription to access the X Handle Marketplace is “to prevent bot spam or misuse,” so that the site can make way for “fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”However, as hinted at by another change coming to the site, a subscribed account does not necessarily mean a bot-free account. I’m curious to see how the X Handle Marketplace launch goes once the feature hits the (paying) public.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In fact, if you mostly use your Kindle for novels or even black-and-white manga rather than color comics or picture books, the Colorsoft will actively make that content look worse. While I've been banging this drum about color e-readers for a while, you don't have to take my word for it: Amazon actually used to warn buyers about this too, but has since taken that warning down.As far back as February, according to a page saved by The Internet Archive, Amazon's FAQ for the Kindle Colorsoft included the following frank commentary on the device's shortcomings:\"The Colorsoft display is distinct from the Paperwhite display. The Kindle Colorsoft is designed to provide a high-quality reading experience in both color and black and white. You may notice that the texture or brightness of the display looks different than the Kindle Paperwhite display. That’s because of the color filter layer that creates the easy on the eyes color reading experience on Kindle Colorsoft. If you are looking for a slightly crisper black and white reading experience, you may want to check out Kindle Paperwhite, which has the fastest page turns and highest contrast ratio of any 2024 Kindle device.\"While not outright derogatory towards the company's color products, the explanation was a noteworthy in that it did admit that the Kindle Paperwhite, despite being less expensive, offers a crisper black and white experience. (Why? Because the color filter in the Colorsoft, which is there whether it's actively being displayed or not, lowers the contrast and can add unwanted texture and shine to text even when you're reading reading black-and-white content).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApparently someone at Amazon corporate thought it was time for a change, and one at the expense of prospective buyers. Over the weekend, the company changed the Colorsoft FAQ once again, and it now reads as follows:The Colorsoft display is distinct from the Paperwhite display, and includes a fully optimized display stack to deliver high quality color reading. The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.That's much less clear. While not outright lying, the new disclaimer sidesteps the device's shortcomings, instead simply acknowledging that the Colorsoft has a \"high quality\" color experience while bringing up an unrelated note about black-and-white resolution. That's a misdirect—the Colorsoft's issues with contrast and artifacts remain, despite matching the Paperwhite in black-and-white resolution, as seen in the picture below.\n    \n            \n            \"Dune\" on the Kindle Colorsoft (left) vs. Kindle Paperwhite (right)\n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nIt's an understandable move from a marketing perspective, but also a disappointing deletion of a rare moment of honesty from a big brand, while emphasizing the larger anxiety behind color e-Ink. (I reached out to Amazon for comment, and will update this story if I hear back.)Color e-ink isn't really ready for the marketFrankly, I don't think most adults have a need for color e-Ink. Unless you're a big comic book reader, there's a good chance that what you're reading on your Kindle is in black-and-white. And if that's the case, you're going to get a better experience by paying less for a device without a color filter. I can see why Amazon would be cagey about it.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Amazon\n                    \n    \nBut with charts and pricing like the above, that's not strictly intuitive, and it's why I appreciated the clarification provided on the old FAQ page so much, especially because it was willing to direct users looking for a specific experience towards a better product for them, even at the expense of profit for Amazon. The new description instead seems tailor made to make it seem like the Paperwhite and Colorsoft are about on par for black-and-white content, but that the Colorsoft also has color, which is just not true. It's actually the misconception I always correct first when writing about this product category, and I'm disappointed to see Amazon change its messaging to spread it. While color e-Ink has a niche appeal, trickery and obfuscation is not the way to sell it.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Apple's distinct new design language has been met with praise and criticism, with some users enjoying the refreshed look, and others bemoaning the UI's issues with visibility and consistency.  It seems Apple was similarly of two minds on the update, having toyed around with the exact look of Liquid Glass throughout the iOS 26 beta testing period. The company seemed to be having trouble settling on a specific balance between the design's glassy effect, which can look really cool, and its overall readability. If buttons are too clear, for example, they'll let in more of the background elements, which can make it more difficult to see them. But by reducing the glass effect too much by adding a tint to the icon and menu backgrounds, Apple risks loses the charm of the design entirely. (Some critics have dubbed it \"Frosted Glass\" by comparison.)While Apple is seemingly still continuing to tweak Liquid Glass, it appears the company has decided that part of the problem is down to user preference. So rather than stick with one look for the design, Apple is now working on a setting that lets you choose whether Liquid Glass looks more clear, or more tinted.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo be clear, or not to be clearThis new setting first appeared in the fourth beta for iOS 26.1, as well as iPadOS 26.1 and macOS 26.1, which Apple released on Monday, Oct. 20. The toggle, which beta testers can find in Settings > Display and Brightness (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings > Appearance on the Mac (macOS), gives users a simple choice in how Liquid Glass looks across their particular system: \"Clear,\" which is more transparent, and is in-line with Liquid Glass' original intent; or \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of menus and windows. You'll likely be able to read these elements better, but you won't see as much of the background shining through. \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nGiving tester what they asked for (sort of)During the pre-release beta testing period, some users called on Apple to add a Liquid Glass \"slider\" to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The idea was to allow users to fine-tune how Liquid Glass looks. Apple seems to have taken a different approach, offering only two levels of transparency with the new control. While a slider (or more transparency options, at least) would be great, what we're getting is better than nothing for users who prefer a more opaque Liquid Glass appearance.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \niOS 26.1 is still in beta testing, so it isn't clear (no pun intended) whether this feature will in fact make it to the official update, and if it does, whether it'll still work the same way. How to fix Liquid Glass right nowBut even without this dedicated settings page, there is something you can do to \"undo\" Liquid Glass: By kicking on the \"Reduce Transparency\" feature in Accessibility settings, you can achieve a similar look to choosing the new \"Tinted\" option. My guess, however, is that \"Tinted\" will achieve a more visually pleasing look, as it is something Apple deliberately implemented to work with the design of Liquid Glass, while reduce Transparency is simply a blanket effect that turns down transparency effects across iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Windows RE offers a series of functions to help you root out whatever is ailing your machine. Using it, you can choose to reset your computer, run an automated diagnosis and repair tool, adjust settings to see if any are causing the issue, uninstall previous updates that might be tripping up Windows, and restore to a previous back Windows backup, among other potentially helpful options. It's a necessary feature of the operating system, meant for times when a simple shut down and restart doesn't help your PC get back to normal operations. So it's not ideal when Windows ships with a bug that not only breaks part of the OS, but also breaks the part of the OS designed to help fix your PC.As spotted by Tom's Hardware, a bug in Windows 11's October update, KB5066835, hinders your ability to access Windows RE. The recovery environment can still load if you need it, but you'll find you won't be able to select any of the options it offers to try to fix your PC. That's because this bug breaks USB device functionality specifically in Windows RE. Simply stated, your mouse and keyboard will not work in Windows RE, preventing any navigation within the recovery environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is obviously bad news for anyone who wants to use Windows RE to fix a problem with their PC—including, ironically, this Windows RE-specific bug. But you might think that so long as your particular issue with Windows isn't prohibiting you from actually using your computer, you could live without Windows RE for the time being. As Tom's Hardware points out, however, it's not so simple: When your PC has trouble starting up, it will automatically boot into the recovery environment. That's normally a good thing, since you'll have the tools to help diagnose and solve the issue. However, when Windows takes you to a screen where you can't use your mouse and keyboard, or interact with any elements whatsoever, you're kind of stuck. Microsoft has issued a patchThe good news is a fix is officially here. Microsoft had called out the bug as a known issue in Windows 11, version 25H2, and said it was working on releasing a fix \"in the coming days.\" That fix came sooner than expected. The new KB5070773 update restores USB device functionality in Windows RE, so you should update as soon as possible. If you have normal access to Windows, all you need to do is head to Start > Settings > Windows Update, and install it when it appears.However, if your PC is stuck in Windows RE, it's a bit trickier to solve. As Tom's Hardware explains, Microsoft recommends users to use their touchscreens or PS/2 ports if available. If not, you may need to rely on a USB recovery drive to get your PC back up and running.  Windows is experiencing other issues, tooWindows is going through it this month. This same October update also broke localhost functionality, which impacted any apps that connect to services running locally on your PC. (Luckily, Microsoft did issue a fix for that bug.) Then, last week, the company also officially ended support for Windows 10, and though it still offers Extended Security Updates for any user that wants to enroll their PC in the program, it puts the security of roughly half a billion PC users into question.   This Windows RE bug is just one more critical issue PC users have to deal with. Hopefully, Microsoft's next Windows 11 build introduces only fixes, and no additional bugs.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

This week, kids are bringing hollowed-out pumpkins into Starbucks and demanding they be filled with pumpkin spice lattes; TikTok is obsessed with a fake video game called Bird Game 3; everyone’s growing the universe's AI slop-pile with videos about a fictional video game, and teens are fighting about Lorax costumes. Plus the world's police departments are issuing a warning about a prank that is not funny and you should never do. Filling pumpkins with pumpkin spice latteLook, we're all excited for Halloween; it's decorative gourd season, motherfuckers. But please, in the name of all that is holy, do not bring a hollowed-out pumpkin to the Starbucks drive-through and ask the baristas to fill it with a pumpkin spice latte. Even if influencers on TikTok are doing it. Even if their videos are getting millions of  views. Virality is not a permission slip. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's fine, sometimes heroic, to be whimsical, but baristas are doing seven invisible jobs at once and being paid for half a job, and trying to force them to be extras in your twee little video is job number eight. Maybe they'll force a smile when you hand them the gourd, but when they say “oh, cute,” there will be murder in their eyes. They want to react like this, I promise:\n\nWhat is \"Bird Game 3\"?Bird Game 3 is the name of an imaginary video game for the imaginary Xbox50 game system. Making AI videos of people who are very excited to play Bird Game 3 is becoming a hot thing to do on TikTok and elsewhere. Unlike almost all other AI slop videos, some of the Bird Game 3 videos are actually funny. Like this one: \n\nAnd this one: \n\nI don't know what everyone is so excited about. Now, when I played the first Bird Game at E3 2010, that was exciting. Everyone is making \"celebrity elevator selfies\"Speaking of AI slop, if you've been anywhere near TikTok lately, you've likely seen the proliferation of posts of people posing with celebrities in elevators, like this one: \n\nThey are, of course, fake—products of AI image generation tools—but it's a fun kind of fakery that's easy to be part of. You just use CapCut or Gemini, or any AI-slop-making machine, and you too can pretend you rode an elevator with Brian Boitano or Ice Spice. If you'd like more detailed instructions, I broke it down here. On a more serious note, the kids making these fake videos are devaluing the unique and meaningful relationship between some random person and a celebrity jerk who are forced to interact because they're trapped in an enclosed space. Now no one will believe my dream-come-true celebrity elevator encounter with Dr. Phil actually happened. Viral videos of the week: Invasion of the Lorax girls Over the last few years, TikTok and Instagram have been taken over by Lorax girls every October. Videos of girls dressed as Dr. Seuss's self-righteous hero are everywhere. Here's a typical example: \n\nThe Lorax costume pioneer seems to be TikToker McKenna, who posted a Lorax video in 2023 that went viral to the tune of over 30 million plays:\n\n Since then, the costume has become very popular; there are over 200,000 TikTok videos tagged #Lorax. The trend has become so widespread that a backlash is building. The word among young men/boys is that only \"unfunny popular girls\" dress as the Lorax for Halloween. Some teenage boys are even calling the costumes a red flag and posting anti-Lorax-Girl meme videos like these:\n\n\n\nFellas, the only thing less funny than dressing as the Lorax for Halloween is complaining about other people dressing as the Lorax for Halloween. Face it: You're actually mad because girls are doing something that isn't designed for male approval. On the flip side of the coin, I can totally understand the appeal of the costume for \"popular girls.\" You gotta really work on shaping your personality to be \"well-liked\" in the murder pit of high school popularity, so having a night where you dress like a pot-bellied goof and act the fool must be liberating, especially when acting the fool in an established way that won't reflect badly upon your image and might get millions of views.Police warn of AI homeless prankLast week, I laid out the basics of the AI Homeless Person prank going viral—basically, kids are AI-faking images of homeless dudes in their houses and sending them to their parents as a funny joke. Well, the cops want everyone to know it's not funny and no one should do it, because some parents, understandably, seem to have called the cops when they got the message.The police in Salem, MA got the ball rolling by issuing a statement warning that pranksters could face up to two and a half years in jail for the stunt. Many other police departments followed, from all over the U.S. and even overseas. My favorite is from Yonkers, NY, who posted this on its Facebook:\"We get it — some pranks are funny and we like to laugh at the best of them. Some, though, pose a public safety risk...\"Yonkers Police Department, you do not \"like to laugh at the best of them.\"  I've had enough teachers use that line to know it's a lie. But on a serious note, it's actually a bad idea to pretend a homeless person is in your house to scare your parents. It wastes resources and the cops coming to your door is almost always a bad thing. If you must pull a prank, try the less confrontational option of generating a shirtless plumber to prank your boyfriend:\n\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

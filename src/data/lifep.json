You won't get access to the Phone app's latest AI features, but if all you want is a reliable way to record phone calls, you'll be set. Google announced this new rollout back in September, calling the ability to record calls a \"fundamentally useful feature,\" even without transcription or automatic note taking. That's certainly true: While the idea of recording phone calls might strike some as nefarious, there are many legitimate applications for recording phone calls, from journalists seeking a record of an phone interview, to patients calling their healthcare providers to make sure they keep track of all medical advice and instruction. Call recording on Android—especially on Google's Pixel devices—has had a turbulent past. While there was once a time you could download a third-party call recorder app without issue, Google started slowly taking away key functions from developers, like blocking access to recordings from microphones. In 2022, the company announced that was blocking access to Android's Accessibility API, the main workaround developers used for their apps—effectively killing the third-party call recorder market. If your phone's manufacturer supported call recording in their primary app, that was still OK, but if not, you basically lost this functionality. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, Google offers a feature called Call Notes, which transcribes and summarizes your calls using Gemini. In addition to these AI enhancements, however, you still receive a recording of the phone call, making these two Pixel series the only ones with the capability. That's why this call recording expansion is so necessary.Call recording on Pixel isn't perfectThere are two key caveats to keep in mind with this feature, however. First, don't expect to record a call without the other party's permission. Even if you live in a region with one-party consent—meaning you don't need both parties to agree to the recording—Google's call recorder will announce that it is about to record the call. Unless the other party isn't paying attention, they will know you're recording—and could choose to hang up the line if they feel uncomfortable. Second, this feature won't be available to all Pixel users, even if you have the proper Pixel device. This feature will only work in regions where call recording is legal, and Google says it is rolling out the functionality to all countries that support it throughout the rest of this year. It seems as of this article, the United States and Canada have the feature, but many other countries do not. If you live somewhere where call recording is legal, but don't see this feature yet, sit tight: It's likely rolling out soon. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up call recording on PixelTo start, make sure you're using a Pixel 6 or newer, running at least Android 14, or a non-Pixel device running at least Android 9. Next, update your Phone app to the latest version.Now, open the Phone app's Settings, then head to Call Assist > Call Recording. Here, you can turn on the toggle next to \"Turn on Call Recording.\" You can also toggle on \"Automatically record calls with non-contacts,\" if you want the app to start recording whenever someone outside your contacts list calls, or \"Automatically record calls with these numbers\" to manually select contacts you'd like the Phone app to record conversations for. You can choose to automatically delete these recordings after seven, 14, or 30 days, or let them stay on your phone forever. You can skip those latter two options, however, if you'd rather make recordings a case-by-case basis. If so, whenever you're in a call, you can choose the Call Assist button to select \"Call Recording.\" (If this is your first recording, you'll need to download some audio files before you're able to record calls.) When you do, the Phone app will ask if you'd like to record the call, which you can agree to. There is then a short countdown before the system alerts everyone on the call that it will begin recording. You can stop the recording at any time from the Call Assist menu. You'll find your new recording in the Home tab.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        The best PDF editor on your Mac is the app your Mac ships with. I'm talking about Preview, an app whose name hides its versatility. It can do a lot more than just opening different types of files. For PDFs, it's as good as most free PDF editors. Enable dark mode for easier reading\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI suffer from migraines and to keep the headaches at bay, I use dark mode wherever I can. In macOS 26 Tahoe, Preview now allows you to enable dark mode for any PDF file, which means that I no longer need to deal with bright white backgrounds when I have to go through any PDF document. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview on your Mac. Now click the View button in the menu bar up top, and select Use Dark Appearance for PDF.\nInsert pages in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview lets you easily add pages to a PDF file. You can either add a blank page or insert a page from a different file. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview, and go to Edit > Insert. You can either choose Blank Page or Page from File….The option to insert a blank page in the PDF is self-explanatory. If you want to insert a page from a different file, there are different ways to do so. The option in the Edit menu will directly insert the whole PDF or image file you select into your PDF. This is fine when you're selecting a single-page PDF that needs to go into a bigger file, but it's not ideal if you want to add just one page from a 50-page document. If you're trying to do this, add pages by opening two PDF files side-by-side in Preview, and dragging pages from the first to the second PDF file. If the sidebar is hidden in Preview, go to View > Thumbnails. You can now drag the thumbnail from one sidebar to another with ease.Reorder pages in a PDF \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you want to change the order of pages in a PDF file in Preview, just drag and rearrange the thumbnails in the sidebar. It's quite smooth and intuitive, and you'll be able to get the job done pretty quickly.Delete pages from a PDF file \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview has a page deletion feature built in, too. Once again, just open a PDF file in Preview, select any page in the sidebar, and press the Delete button to remove the page from your PDF document. This option is also available under Edit > Delete.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate, edit, and redact text in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use basic markup tools to add, select, edit, and redact text in Preview. These tools, along with the options to annotate and sign PDFs, are all available under the Markup Toolbar in Preview for Mac. To access these tools, open any PDF in Preview, and click the pencil icon in the toolbar. Alternatively, you can go to View > Show Markup Toolbar. These tools are more than sufficient for quick edits to PDF documents.Add a PDF password\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use Preview to add a password to a PDF file, or to remove passwords from a file. To add a password to the PDF file you're viewing in Preview, go to File > Edit Permissions, and check the box labelled Require Password to Open Document. Once you've added and confirmed the password, you'll also have to add an owner password to the document. The owner password lets you restrict others from making changes to the PDF file, printing it, etc. Ideally, it should be different from the password used to open the PDF file. With both passwords added, click Apply to confirm the changes.Rotate pages in a PDF\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, PDF files arrive with an unusable orientation—e.g., portrait pages scanned in landscape mode. In such cases, you can use Preview to rotate the pages of a PDF. Just go to the page you want to rotate and press Command-L to rotate it left or Command-R to rotate right. Fun fact: You can also do the same thing using your trackpad. Use two fingers to mimic a rotating motion and you'll see that the page of the PDF file rotates to the left or the right.These options are also available under the Tools menu. Over there, you'll also find options to flip a page horizontally or vertically, as well as a feature that removes the background from a PDF page.\n            ",

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. But it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Sora, the company's short-form AI video generator, is already tricking people across social media with hyperrealistic AI slop. I fear we've already reached a point where it's too difficult to trust that what you seen on your feeds is actually real.But today, we're taking a break from the AI video doom, and returning our attention back to OpenAI's flagship product. On Wednesday, the company announced the latest versions of GPT, the model that power ChatGPT: GPT-5.1 Instant, and GPT-5.1 Thinking. OpenAI says Instant is the company's most-used model, but is \"now warmer, more intelligent, and better at following your instructions.\" Thinking, on the other hand, is the company's reasoning model, and is both faster and \"easier to understand\" with simple tasks, as well as more \"persistent\" on complex requests.It seems like mostly minor updates to me, but here's what's new, according to OpenAI:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGPT-5.1 InstantLet's take a look at Instant first. OpenAI claims the model is \"surprisingly\" playful. For the prompt \"I'm feeling stressed and could use some relaxation tips,\" OpenAI shows two sample answers for GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 Instant, respectively: GPT-5: \"Here are a few simple, effective ways to help ease stress — you can mix and match depending on how you’re feeling and how much time you have.\"  GPT-5.1 Instant: \"I’ve got you, Ron — that’s totally normal, especially with everything you’ve got going on lately. Here are a few ways to decompress depending on what kind of stress you’re feeling.\"I can see the differences, of course: GPT-5 is a bit more serious in tone, while 5.1 offers that classic AI overly friendly approach, and makes sure to include the user's name. How human. But scrolling through the rest of the comparison, I'm not so sure I see a huge difference. Both break down their various suggestions into bullet points, though 5.1 occasionally includes more flowery language like \"bonus points.\"Another change OpenAI touts is improved instruction following. The presented examples show the user prompting the bot with the request \"Always respond with six words.\" GPT-5 follow suit for its first response, but when asked where the user should travel to this summer, the bot completely ignores the six-word answer mandate, and offers a full response instead. GPT-5.1, on the other hand, keeps up the bit throughout the exchange, regardless of how complex the questions become. I get that it's just an example, but why would someone need their bot to follow such an odd request? I suppose it implies that GPT-5.1 will maintain your original instructions throughout an interaction, but if so, why not show an application where that's actually useful? I'd rather receive a fuller answer to important questions than have all responses be exactly six words.  Finally, OpenAI says that Instant can still tap into reasoning models when appropriate, while still generating quick results. The company doesn't get into it much, but they must have tweaked something in the algorithm that lets the model \"think\" over complex suggestions, without going so deep that the response takes too long.  GPT-5.1 ThinkingGPT-5.1 Thinking is a direct upgrade to the existing GPT-5 Thinking model. Like GPT-5.1 Instant, OpenAI says the model can adjust its processing according to the task at hand. In theory, that means 5.1 Thinking can respond to simpler prompts more quickly, while taking more time \"thinking\" through complicated tasks. OpenAI claims that GPT-5.1 Thinking is about twice as fast when responding to the \"fastest tasks\" and twice as slow on the \"slowest tasks\" when compared to GPT-5, when both models are set to Standard.OpenAI says 5.1 Thinking uses less specialized language, and doesn't necessarily assume you understand complex terms. The company shows an example of someone asking the bot to explain BABIP and and wRC+ (Batting Average on Balls in Play and Weighted Runs Created Plus, respectively). GPT-5's explanation includes abbreviations, formulas, and insider concepts that I certainly wouldn't pick up as someone who knows next to nothing about baseball. The 5.1 Thinking result, on the other hand, spells out those abbreviations, walks the user through the formulas instead of simply displaying them, and goes into more detail about certain complex topics. I can see how that would offer some improvements in clarity, even though you always need to watch out for hallucinations. Sure, it's great to make responses more clear, but that won't help if the responses themselves are completely inaccurate.Adjusting ChatGPT's tone\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nAs part of these new models, OpenAI is changing the way you customize ChatGPT's tone and style. The new Personalization options include the usual \"Default\" tone, but \"Listener\" is now called \"Friendly,\" while \"Robot\" is now \"Efficient.\" (Perhaps GPT took offense to the latter.) OpenAI says these options all have updates, but doesn't specify what those are. In addition, you have new options to choose from as well. These include \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); and \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative). Lastly, the company says it is currently testing a new settings option that lets you fine-tune the tone and style of the bot to your liking, but is launching the experiment with a limited pool of users only. What else is newOpenAI says that by default, you won't need to choose between these two models: GPT-5.1 Auto will decide which model makes sense for you based on your query. That's been the case since the company launched GPT-5, though paid subscribers can still manually choose their model. Speaking of paid subscribers, GPT-5.1 is rolling out first to Pro, Plus, Go, and Business users. The company started shipping the model on Wednesday, and says it will gradually appear over the next few days. The model will arrive to free and logged-out users soon, though there's no specific timeline yet. Paid subscribers will also have access to GPT-5 for three months, as OpenAI takes it time winding down the older model. The company likely doesn't want to repeat the issues caused when it immediately removed models like GPT-4o and older from ChatGPT, as users who were quite literally attached to the model were upset to lose it. OpenAI is careful to note that GPT-5's sunsetting period has no impact on existing legacy models like 4o, which are still available for the time being. For a new update to GPT, this really isn't all that flashy. Maybe that's a good thing: OpenAI overhyped GPT-5, which was a let down for many fans of GPT-4o—especially when the company subsequently took that model away. Keeping expectations in check for GPT-5.1 is likely a smart move, but I can't help but wonder if it's a sign that AI advancements are starting to slow down. We know AI companies are running out of data to train their models on, we just don't know how soon the impacts will be felt. GPT-5.1 probably isn't a harbinger of doom for OpenAI, but it is interesting that it isn't an exponential improvement, either.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        If you're a Windows user, this is your monthly reminder to ensure you install all available security updates. Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday release fixes one zero-day vulnerability that has been actively exploited in the wild, with 63 flaws patched in total. As reported by Bleeping Computer, the November Patch Tuesday update addresses 29 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, 2 security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 16 remote code execution vulnerabilities, 11 information disclosure vulnerabilities, 2 denial of service vulnerabilities, and 3 spoofing vulnerabilities. (Note that these figures do not include patches for Microsoft Edge and Mariner.)In addition to the zero-day, four of the vulnerabilities being addressed—two remote code execution bugs and one each of the elevation of privilege and information disclosure flaws—are labeled \"critical.\" \nPatch fixes one zero-day threatAll security updates are important to install as soon as possible, but especially those that patch zero-days, which are vulnerabilities that are actively exploited or publicly exposed before the developer makes an official fix available. Without this month's patch, Windows users are vulnerable to CVE-2025-62215, an elevation of privilege flaw in the Windows Kernel. The bug allows threat actors to gain system privileges upon winning a \"race condition,\" or improper synchronization in Windows Kernel. The vulnerability was identified by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), though no additional details about exploitation have been made public. Other updates for Windows usersWindows 11 users will also see the rollout of the upgraded Start menu alongside Patch Tuesday updates—the new interface is scrollable with app categories and adapts to the size of your screen. Other changes include an redesigned battery icon and improved features for File Explorer, Voice Access, and Click to Do. As of last month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has ended support for Windows 10, though users who have enrolled in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will continue to get security patches through Oct. 13, 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple Music has been steadily getting useful new features since the release of iOS 26, and the latest changes are especially exciting. Finally, the music streaming service is adding support for offline lyrics, which will officially come in iOS 26.2 when it releases in the next few weeks (although you can try them out now via the iOS 26.2 beta). Meanwhile, in iOS 26.1, users got the ability to swipe on the mini player to go to the next or previous song in their lineup, alongside enhanced AI DJ features and playlist folders for improved music organization. These followed previous additions, such as lyrics translation, a new DJ-like feature called AutoMix, and animated cover art on the lock screen. If that sounds like a lot, I've got you covered. Here are all the new Apple Music features in iOS 26, starting with the most recent.Apple Music lyrics now work offlineWhen I travel, I rarely have access to great connectivity. It always annoys me when Apple Music just stops showing lyrics while I'm offline, which happens whenever I take a flight, or when I'm traveling in the beautiful mountains in my country. Previously, I would download songs from Apple Music to keep me company during these offline periods, but I did miss having access to lyrics. That's about to change with iOS 26.2, which is currently available in beta. Eagle-eyed Reddit users spotted support for offline lyrics in iOS 26.2, so you can expect it to ship to your iPhone soon.Swipe to change songs\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nThis is one of the most exciting additions to Apple Music, and it came in iOS 26.1. When you're listening to music in the app, you can swipe left or right on the mini player to switch to the previous or next song. Previously, you had to expand the mini player to see the previous/next song buttons, but now swapping music is much faster. And even if the player is expanded, you can still swipe on the song's name up top to change the track.\nLyrics Translation for your favorite songsApple Music has had time-synced lyrics for a while now, which works great when you speak the language the song was written in. However, it's not as helpful when you're listening to songs in different languages, and that's where Lyrics Translation comes in. It adds translations below each time-synced lyric line, making it easy to follow a song's meaning, too. I've been seeing translated lyrics for many songs across multiple languages, even when the primary song lyrics are in a non-Roman script.Learn how to pronounce lyrics correctly\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nAnother iOS 26 lyrics upgrade lets Apple Music show you the correct pronunciations for lyrics in foreign languages. Not every song has lyrics in Roman script, so if you can't read the alphabet they're in, this new feature will help you learn how to pronounce those words. It does this by showing you a transliteration from the original script to Roman, which makes it easier to sing along. I've been listening to songs by various Indian musicians, and noticing that Apple Music almost always has transliterations available to help with pronunciation.AutoMix is an AI DJ for your playlistsAutoMix is a new addition to Apple Music's playback controls. You'll see it alongside the Shuffle, Repeat, and Autoplay buttons. When enabled, AutoMix will analyze the audio features of songs and use DJ-like tricks such as time stretching and beat matching to deliver continuous playback. Initially, I did not like AutoMix much because it often made the transitions between songs very jarring. Over time, that has become a lot less noticeable, but I still wouldn't use it with any of my own painstakingly curated playlists, where I've manually matched the sounds at the end of one song with the sounds at the start of the next one. With the release of iOS 26.1, Apple Music has also added AutoMix support over AirPlay. This means that, when using AutoMix while streaming songs from my iPhone to my HomePod mini (or any other AirPlay speaker), the AI DJ will continue to do its thing. Sort playlists into custom folders\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI enjoy Apple Music's editorially curated playlists, but my friends and I have already curated a bunch of playlists for our various moods and occasions. I listen to these frequently, but finding them becomes a bit of a challenge when you've added hundreds of playlists to your account. Thanks to Apple Music's new playlist folders, I've been able to tame this chaos quite easily. Get started by opening the Music app on your iPhone and going to Library > Playlists. Tap the + button in the top-right, and select Create New Folder. The good news is that you're free to create nested folders if you wish, which is perfect for all those obsessed with organization. Pin your favorite playlistsThis is a sweet feature that lets you quickly open your favorite Apple Music playlists. You can press and hold any playlist in the Music app in iOS 26, and pin it to the top of the Library tab. If you've pinned your favorite contacts in Messages, then you'll find music pinning to be a familiar feature. You can pin up to six items at a time in Apple Music, which is ideal for bookmarking your favorites.Animated cover art comes to your lock screenAnimated cover art is one of the more visually appealing features of Apple Music, and now it's coming to your lock screen as well. When you play a song that has animated album art, you can tap the player on the lock screen to see it in a neat full-screen view.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're not happy with having your music on the lock screen alone, you'll enjoy Apple Music's iOS 26 home screen widgets. You can quickly add different sized widgets to any of your iPhone's home screens, and start playing music without even launching the Music app. You can choose widgets that show recently played music, top music in your region, recommendations, or even radio stations. Each home screen widget for Apple Music is available in three sizes, so you can pick one that's best for your current home screen layout.A karaoke feature for Apple TV usersApple Music is also getting a new feature called Sing, which only works if you have an iPhone with iOS 26 and an Apple TV running tvOS 26. With all those requirements in place, you can use your iPhone as a mic and have your voice amplified by Apple Music to have a fun karaoke experience right at home.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Google is adding one of the iPhone's most controversial features to its latest Pixel phones, but it's promising to show a bit more restraint than Apple did. Yes, as part of the November 2025 Pixel feature drop, Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones (excluding the Pixel 9a) are getting AI notification summaries.The problem with AI notification summariesIf you're reeling back after reading that, I don't blame you. This is one of the few AI features Apple beat Google to the punch on, and when they came out during the iOS 18.3 beta, the summaries were quickly criticized for handling hard topics like breakups with a cold tone, as well as for misreporting the news.Apple quickly pulled news summaries (although they've since come back) and made it clearer when an AI was writing a notification, but it seems Google's still being a bit more cautious with its launch.\nHow AI Notification Summaries on Pixel work\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nRather than trying to organize every notification you might get, Google's AI Summaries are just starting off with popular chat apps for now, including its own Messages app and alternatives like WhatsApp. Additionally, they'll only kick in on \"longer chats,\" with the idea being to give you, \"digestible conversation recaps.\" That means you're going to see far fewer AI notifications than on the iPhone, which currently uses them for news, entertainment, chats, email, and more. That's probably a safer approach for Google, but it does mean the AI summaries are meant to be used more to get you quickly back up to speed, rather than for organization (although that will change in the future).As on the iPhone, AI notification summaries on the Pixel will be indicated by a small icon with a sparkle and a few lines below it, with the summary following. They'll also be italicized for additional visual distinction.How to turn on AI Notification Summaries on PixelGoogle is also exercising caution by making its AI notification summaries entirely opt-in. That means you'll need to manually turn them on before you start seeing them, which you can do under Settings > Notifications > Notification Summaries. While on this page, you'll also be able to exclude certain apps from sending AI notification summaries, by adding them to the \"Don't include these apps\" list.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're still not seeing the summaries after enabling them, ensure your Android System Intelligence is enabled under Settings > Notifications > Privacy > Notification read, reply & control. Additionally, summaries will not be generated while your phone is in battery saver mode, or while you're actively using it (per Google, for them to kick in, \"the screen must be off for a moment\").When will my Pixel get AI Notification Summaries?AI Notification summaries start rolling out today, alongside the November system patch. However, they're not automatically included in the downloadable patch, so it might be a while before you see them (I don't have them yet).It's still not a bad idea to get your phone fully up-to-date in the meantime. To download the November 2025 Pixel update, either wait for a notification from Google, or head to Settings > System > Software updates to manually check if it's been rolled out to you yet.What's next for Pixel's AI Notification Summaries?While today's update is clearly just Google dipping its toes in the water, the company does have bigger plans for December, where some Pixels will also start automatically silencing \"lower-priority notifications\" and will start automatically sorting them into categories like \"News\" and \"Promotions.\" Hopefully, Google will have learned some lessons from Apple by the time those features go live.\n            ",

I'm asking the tough questions about whether wearables can really improve your health, how to find the right one for you, and how to make the most of the data wearables can offer.When I test smartwatches and fitness trackers, I always pay attention to accuracy. Is my running pace correct? Does the device capture the ups and downs of my heart rate? I even got a VO2max lab test to check a bunch of watches' fitness scores. But you'll notice that one thing I don't test for accuracy is calorie burn. None of my devices come close to agreeing on the number of calories they think I'm burning, and I don't expect them to. Even scientists who study the accuracy of wearables can't answer the question in a way that's useful when you're shopping for this year's devices—but we'll get into why that is below. There was a time, before Fitbits, when nobody knew quite how many calories they were burning on a daily basis. Sure, you could calculate a rough estimate based on your body size, sex, and age. You could choose whether or not to believe the calorie readout on the cardio machines at the gym. (Spoiler: don't.) But the idea that a gadget on your wrist could tell you how many calories you personally burned during one particular day was revolutionary. It was also wrong.   \nHow fitness trackers calculate calorie burnBefore I discuss how accurate fitness trackers are, let’s look at where they get their numbers. For calorie calculations, the main sources are motion and heart rate data. For motion, trackers use accelerometers to figure out when your body is moving, and by how much. If you have a watch on your wrist, and the watch swings back and forth rhythmically while sort of bouncing up and down, your gadget guesses that you must be walking. If there is quicker bouncing and your wrist makes a smaller movement, you’re probably running. This is the basic idea behind how trackers detect how many steps you’re taking. If you’ve paid attention to your step count, you already know some of the ways this can be inaccurate. If you’re shopping, for example, keeping your hand on the shopping cart handle may result in you not getting credit for the steps you’re taking. That depends on the device, though. (For a perfect illustration of this issue, see these tests I did comparing a Garmin to an Apple Watch on a treadmill. When I rested my hands on the treadmill handle, the Apple Watch recorded 318 steps while the Garmin recorded none.)Then there’s the heart rate sensor: Since your hands don’t always move predictably during exercise, it can be easier to just tell your watch that you’ll be cycling or doing yoga or whatever. The gadget then uses your heart rate to make an educated guess about how much work your body is doing. Whatever the source of the data—heart rate, movements, or a combination—the gadget processes it through a formula to calculate how many calories it thinks you’re burning. Your age, weight, and sex may figure into this equation. Generally, though, the fitness tracker doesn’t actually know how many calories you’re burning; instead, it’s calculating a probable number based on incomplete information. Why there's no simple test for accuracyIf humans were robots, all built the same, all moving in predictable patterns, this formulaic approach might work. But humans are complicated, and technology often gets confused. For example, you may get different step counts if you put a device on your right versus left wrist. And the optical heart rate sensors that a lot of trackers use may be less accurate on dark skin compared to lighter skin. These problems relate to the data that the trackers gather, but calorie burn isn't a direct measurement. It's a calculation, and different algorithms can come up with different calorie burn numbers depending on how the algorithm is designed. The companies that make fitness trackers aren’t required to publish their algorithms or verify that their calorie counts are accurate. They can just put a device on the market, and there you are, comparing wearables on shopping sites without any information about how accurate they are, outside of the companies’ claims.Researchers are interested in fitness trackers’ accuracy, which would seem like a good thing. They want to be able to use wearables in research or recommend them for individuals and healthcare providers, and so they'll run studies comparing consumer devices to lab equipment. This sounds like a great way to answer our questions! But there’s a huge delay in actually getting that information, and it’s often published too late to be useful. By the time a researcher buys a batch of the latest model, runs a study, writes it up, submits it to a journal, and finally gets it published, several years may have gone by, and the company has moved on to the next model. That delay is why I (usually) can't use scientific studies to weigh in on the devices I write about. Here's a great example of how frustrating it can be: this review was published in 2025, and found the Series 1 was the Apple Watch that turned up the most often in the studies the authors were able to gather. The Series 9 and 10 watches were completely missing from the available data, and as a reminder, we're now up to a Series 11. With that caveat about delays, I still think it’s useful to look at the research on fitness trackers to see what themes emerge. Are any of them good at estimating your calorie burn? What studies say about fitness trackers’ accuracyTime for the bad news. A study from 2020 that looked at a variety of gadgets from Apple, Garmin, Polar, and Fitbit found that all the devices are inaccurate more often than they are accurate. The authors considered a device to be accurate if its reading was plus or minus 3% when compared to a more reliable measure of energy expenditure (that is, calorie burn) in a lab setting. Here’s how some of the top brands fared: Garmins underestimated calorie burn 69% of the time.Apple watches overestimated calorie burn 58% of the time.Polar devices overestimated calorie burn 69% of the time.Fitbits underestimated calorie burn 48% of the time and overestimated 39% of the time.The fact that Fitbits were roughly correct on average doesn’t mean they were useful. If sometimes your device overestimates and sometimes it underestimates, it’s not very helpful unless you know which is which. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA 2018 review specifically of Fitbits found that accuracy varied greatly depending on factors like where they were worn (torso was more accurate than wrist), whether you were walking uphill, and whether you walked at a constant speed or stopped and started. The accuracy also varied by device, with the Fitbit Classic underestimating calorie burn and the Fitbit Charge usually overestimating. The devices just aren’t accurate enough to know how many calories you’re really burningA 2022 study compared the Apple Watch 6, the Fitbit Sense, and the Polar Vantage V. The researchers had volunteers wear all three gadgets while sitting quietly, walking, running, cycling, and strength training. Every gadget, for every activity, was awarded a judgment of “poor accuracy,” with coefficients of variation ranging from 15% to 30%.And this 2025 review of Apple Watch studies—the same one I mentioned above—found that calorie burn was, on average, off by about 18%. The authors mention a proposed standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission that recommends fitness trackers not be off by more than 10%. That's clearly not being met, although the researchers noted that newer models may be more accurate than earlier ones. To get a sense of these percentages, let's say your true calorie burn is 2,000 calories per day. A device that's off by 15% might report that you burned 1,700 calories, or that you burned 2,300. If you're using your device to figure out how much to eat, you could be way off in meeting your calorie goals. If these devices are all inaccurate, how can you know how many calories you're burning?It’s probably most useful if you think of your calorie burn as a number you cannot measure directly. Treat it as a black box: I burn some unknowable number of calories, now what? The only common reason you would need an accurate estimate of calorie burn is if you are trying to figure out how much food you need to eat. If you want to lose weight, you want to eat less than you burn; if you want to gain weight, you want the reverse; and if you’re trying to maintain your weight, you want to eat roughly the same as what you burn. But think about it this way: you don't actually need to know your calorie burn if you have the other two terms in the equation—your calorie intake, and your weight. It's considered more accurate to adjust how much to eat based directly on your weight, rather than using calorie burn estimates as a middleman. Let’s say you’re training for a marathon and you want to make sure you fuel yourself appropriately. Well, if you’re under-eating, you’ll start to lose weight. When you start to see the scale trending downward, that’s your signal to add a few hundred calories to your diet. If, after that adjustment, your weight stays steady, then you know you’re eating the right amount. As you increase your training (or if you take time off to rest a sprained ankle), you can make more adjustments as you go. I have a post here detailing how to make these adjustments with the help of either a paid app, a group of free apps, or a DIY spreadsheet. If you’ve been using a fitness tracker instead, and it’s working for you, feel free to keep using it. But if the tracker ever stops giving you the results you want, you can safely leave it out of the equation. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

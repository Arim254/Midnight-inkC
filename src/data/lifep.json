If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

We are giving you a $5 credit towards your next month of service that can be redeemed after Jan 16 when paying with a credit card online. This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us. If you’re still having trouble connecting, please restart your device (power down and power back on).The amount may be smaller, but it does seem to be a bit more convenient to claim, since it sounds like you can apply it while paying your bill (although I can't make any promises for people using auto pay). Like Verizon's offer, it also doesn't seem to be discriminating between those affected by the outage and those who weren't, as noted by a user on Reddit.\nSome comments from other Visible subscribers on Reddit did point out that they had yet to receive the text, although I'm assuming that's due to a slow rollout more than anything else, as textless users who reached out to customer service were able to confirm they were offered the $5 credit as well. I've reached out to Visible to confirm if the $5 credit applies to everyone, and will update this post when I hear back (I also asked if it would be applied to automatic payments).As for why the payment is so much smaller, it's probably due to the difference in cost between Verizon and Visible. Verizon said it based its $20 payout on the price for \"multiple days of service,\" and frankly, those same days cost much less on Visible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile Visible uses the same network as Verizon, it sets itself apart by giving its users lower priority while connecting, which lets it offer unlimited plans starting at $20/month. Prices range to $33/month, but essentially, $5 goes a lot further on the low cost network, meaning it represents a similar value to $20 for a proper Verizon plan.Whether that's a fair price for an unexpected day of spotty connectivity, I'll leave up to you.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It marks a middle ground between the Free and Plus plans, coming in at $8/month vs. the Plus plan's $20/month, and is arguably the first \"affordable\" ChatGPT subscription.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nWhat you get is basically an expanded version of the Free tier, as it does not give you access to any new models or features, but does put a higher limit on messages, uploads, images, and memory. It also gives you unlimited access to ChatGPT's new 5.2 model, as opposed to the limited usage that comes with the Free tier. \nEssentially, it's aimed at everyday users who just need a little bit more from the AI, but don't necessarily want more power user-oriented features like advanced reasoning models or Sora video generation.However, with that price cut over the Plus plan comes a double-edged sword. Announced alongside ChatGPT Go were ads, which OpenAI said it's planning to start testing in the U.S. for the Free and Go tiers \"in the coming weeks.\" We've seen hints that ads would be coming to ChatGPT for a while, but now we know roughly what they'll look like.OpenAI says that ChatGPT ads will be clearly labeled, will show up below answers, and will focus on products that are relevant to whatever conversation you're having. The company promises that ads won't influence your answers and that your ChatGPT conversations will be kept private from advertisers, but that your ads will be personalized over time. However, you'll be able to turn off ad personalization and clear the data used for it at any time.Oddly enough, for this initial testing phase, OpenAI also says ads will only apply to users who are logged in, meaning that if you're planning to use the Free tier anyway, you might be able to skirt them for now by just staying logged out. You'll lose out on features like memory, but it might be worth it depending on your priorities. ChatGPT Go users will have no choice but to see ads, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nAlongside the announcement, OpenAI posted a few examples of what ads would look like in the app, but nothing is final yet. Of note, ads will not run on accounts where the user either admits to being under 18, or the company predicts they are. Similarly, sensitive topics like health or politics should remain ad-free.Both of today's announcements point to ways AI is trying to become profitable in 2026, which has continually proven to be challenging for the companies operating these chatbots, despite heavy investment. Unsurprisingly, they rely on the same methods pre-AI companies have relied on for decades: Ads and subscriptions. But for now, OpenAI is making at least two promises it's hoping will help the news go down more easily.First, the company says it will \"always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that's ad-free.\" That's probably cold comfort to anyone who values their wallet. But second, and perhaps most surprising if true, is that OpenAI still says it's not going to optimize for \"time spent in ChatGPT\" over \"user trust and experience.\" That'll be a boon for usability, but less time spent in-app will mean serving fewer ads. I'm curious to see how long OpenAI will stick to that commitment, especially as monetary incentives push the company in the other direction.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

With high praise from Lifehacker own review and an outstanding rating on PCMag, the powerful, future-proof S25 Ultra is a top choice for Android users.\nThe model on sale includes 512GB storage and a large 6.9-inch AMOLED display with thinner bezels, an updated anti-glare coating, and a 120Hz refresh rate. Softened corners make it more ergonomic to hold, and it’s more durable than its predecessors thanks to an IP68 rating, upgraded Gorilla Armor glass, and a stronger titanium frame.Powering the phone is the speedy Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which runs the device’s AI features, games, and any other multitasking needs smoothly. The built-in S Pen is still there, tucked into the phone’s body, but it no longer includes Bluetooth functions, so it can’t be used as a remote camera button or slideshow controller, unfortunately. The SnapDragon 8 Elite also improves the phone's battery life; the 5,000 mAh-capacity battery lasts over 14 hours with the screen on constant brightness and location sharing on.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou’ll get a full suite of Galaxy AI tools, like converting spoken speech to text, drawing assist, and the digital assistant Google Gemini. While these generational changes are more about refinements than full-on transformation, a $300 discount makes this a great excuse to swap out your own phone with an upgraded Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The entire ecosystem seemingly exists to manipulate you, which can make finding clarity hard. I've written about how to avoid anxiety bait, which can be an important step toward healthy and productive engagement, but an important step is recognizing when you're being manipulated. RageCheck is a potentially useful tool here.Built using concepts from social science research, this website can analyze any link or screenshot. It points out examples of potentially manipulative language, from us-versus-them framing to emotionally loaded phrasing. \"The system analyzes text for linguistic patterns commonly associated with manipulative framing—language optimized to provoke high-arousal reactions over understanding,\" says the methodology page. \"It does not assess factual accuracy or political bias.\"Using the site is simple: just paste a link to an article and hit Enter. After a few moments, you'll see a statistical breakdown of the potentially manipulative language in the piece across five categories—emotional heat, us versus them, moral outrage, black-and-white thinking, and fight picking. The article is excerpted below, with examples of these tactics highlighted. In the left panel you'll see a \"Bait Score,\" which is an attempt to calculate how manipulative the article is being. Below that, you'll see a list of the potentially manipulative techniques employed in the article.\nNone of this is intended to be used as an alternative to fact checking or serve as some kind of truth-detecting machine. \"A high score means content uses manipulative framing—it doesn't mean the underlying claims are false,\" says the about page. \"Conversely, a low score doesn't mean content is true.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's worth pointing out that the techniques this tool detects also aren't necessarily bad. Some news stories really should inspire moral outrage, especially in the context of an opinion piece or editorial. Regardless, there's still value in identifying those techniques.Basically, this is a tool that can help you think critically about the media you're consuming, not do that critical thinking for you. Use it if you want to learn a little bit about the kinds of rhetorical tricks you might be vulnerable to.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

A versatile option for both multi-tasking at work and casual gaming, it’s currently 33% off at $799 (originally $1,199).\nThis entry-level gaming monitor is ultra-wide (32:9) with a Dual QHD display (5,120 x 1,440) with HDR400 support, a height-adjustable stand, and built-in speakers, which maximize your desk space even more. While its giant display with tons of usable space is the main draw, its 120Hz refresh rate offers smooth visuals and fast reactions, but may not suffice for pro-gamers who need an ultra-fast 240Hz-plus performance for competitive play. VESA DisplayHDR 400 gives you solid color accuracy and brightness, though it can’t match the contrast of an OLED panel, and users may experience a slight gamma shift at the edges of this panel due to its width. USB-C with up to 90 W charging and a KVM Switch, which allows users to connect and control two sources to the display at the same time from a single keyboard and mouse, makes it an effective dock-style hub for laptops and desktops. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re looking more screen real estate in a single monitor, smoother visuals than a basic office monitor, and an option that you can toggle between both during work and after hours for your gaming needs, the Samsung 49-inch ViewFinity S95UC monitor may not be the fastest or HDR-impressive compared to higher-end OLED models. But at around $800, this ultra-wide display is a capable, all-in-one alternative to a dual-monitor setup that also helps you reclaim more desk space.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

In 2017, the Echo Dot was the single best-selling item on Amazon during its Prime Day sale, outselling both the Nintendo Switch and Instant Pot. Amazon's goal was partly to heavily discount the device in order to install its voice assistant, Alexa, in as many homes as possible—likely in hopes to capitalize on the voice commerce revolution that industry analysts predicted would be worth over $40 billion by 2022. But something went awry. Despite Amazon's complete domination of the home-voice-thing market, by 2022, Alexa was being called a \"colossal failure,\" 10,000 people were laid off from Amazon, and the company reportedly lost billions in a year.  While shopping by voice has grown slowly and steadily since its birth, it never lived up to the hype bubble of the late teens, and it's a fascinating story about how tech predictions go wrong. It's not fun to shop with your voiceSo what went wrong with voice shopping? I asked Jacquelyn Berney, the president of tech marketing firm VI Branding, why she thought people aren't shopping by voice as much as predicted, and her answer was simple: it's not fun. \"My belief is that people like shopping ... and voice shopping takes away that dopamine hit,\" Berney said. \"We want to remove friction in our lives. But shopping is not friction.\"\nShopping via Alexa and its pals makes one of the most dopamine-friendly aspects of shopping impossible: you can't see the thing before you buy it. That doesn't matter if you're re-ordering dog food, but it's death for some kinds of shopping. Here's how Jason Goldberg, then SVP of commerce and content at Razorfish, described the likelihood of people shopping for clothing using Alexa or similar devices in a 2018 interview: \"Especially for first-time purchases with complicated attributes like size and color, people are never going to want to buy something via voice.\" It's not easier to shop with your voiceWhile shopping can be fun, it's also often a pain, and shopping by voice doesn't alleviate the \"hassle factor\" of making purchases online—it adds to it. In marketing circles, reducing consumers' \"cognitive load\" is seen as a key to driving sales—if you make it faster and easier for people to shop, they'll probably shop more. Strictly in terms of physical effort, shopping by voice is easier than shopping from a webpage—you can do it while you're doing something else—but the mental effort, the cognitive load, is greater. \"In practice, [voice shopping] can feel like more work because you’re waiting for the assistant to talk you through things you could skim instantly on a screen or in a store,\" Berney said. It's not as secure to shop with your voiceShopping with your voice is more than just a pain, it's a potential security threat. Keeping your password or PIN secure on a shopping platform is possible, but saying all those numbers is annoying, especially if other people can hear you. So many people didn't bother, and children started using Alexa to order dollhouses and cookies, mischievous parrots ordered grapes, and a late-night talk show host ordered pancake mix for the people watching their show. Ultimately, consumers don't trust the security aspects of voice shopping: 45% of respondents in a recent study done by PWC said “I don't trust or feel comfortable sending payment through my voice assistant.”What happened to all those Echo Dots?In retrospect it's hard to believe industry analysts would put enough faith in shopping with your voice to confidently predict sales would surpass $40 billion by 2022. It's harder to believe that Amazon would risk billions on a product that was inferior to the shopping platform that the company had already built. To be fair, despite a rocky start, Amazon's Alexa devices proved very popular—the company has sold millions of them and \"Alexa\" is a household name—but most consumers don't use them to shop. Amazon may have envisioned Alexa as a home shopping kiosk, but consumers want a jukebox: most people use smart speakers to play music. It was nice of Amazon to subsidize the cost of millions of customers' clock radios, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt might not have blown up as predicted, but voice-powered shopping has made modest inroads with consumers. According to consumer research from October, 2025, 43% of voice-enabled device owners use their devices to shop, but only if you include things like \"researching products\" and \"tracking packages\" as shopping. Only 22% of smart-speaker users actually make purchases with their smart devices, and those purchases tend to be household goods like paper towels, cleaning supplies, and batteries. Where did industry analysts go wrong?It's impossible to tell exactly what causes a general missing of the mark in an industry, but the voice shopping bubble was at least partially inflated by a misunderstanding. In a 2014 interview with Fast Company, Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Chinese search engine Baidu, said, \"In five years time at least 50% of all searches are going to be either through images or speech.\" This often repeated statistic seemed to point to an inevitable voice dominated market, but Ng was talking specifically about people in China using a specific search engine, not everyone online, everywhere. Over time, a context-specific prediction began to be seen as conventional wisdom, and by 2017, you had confident predictions that $40 billion would be spent on voice shopping by 2022, and that voice input would naturally translate into buying behavior. That shaped corporate decisions like Amazon effort to corner the market with Alexa. But as the bubble deflated, the smart speaker found its true form: a radio that you can also use to re-order paper towels, a useful but limited tool instead of a paradigm-shifting disruption. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The 32\" Samsung Odyssey G50D S27DG50 is a flat, entry-level alternative to some of the line’s pricier curved monitors, and right now, it’s 42% off at $249.99 (down from $429.99).\nThe 27-inch, 1440p display has wide viewing angles and is ideal for those who want ample screen space without stepping up to an ultra-wide monitor. It has a 180Hz max refresh rate and consistently low input lag, as well as FreeSync and G-SYNC VRR support to minimize screen tearing. That said, some reviews mention low contrast and a poor dimming system with blacks that can look gray in very dark rooms. While response time is fast, there can be a bit of motion blur that occurs with fast-moving objects, which is to be expected with this price range. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThough the G5 is marketed primarily as a gaming monitor, it’s also versatile for everyday use thanks to its great color accuracy, effective glare reduction in well-lit rooms, and strong ergonomic adjustments. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly QHD gaming system with a high refresh rate, reliable brightness, and wide viewing angles, the 32\" Samsung Odyssey G50D S27DG50 monitor performs well and offers good value at $249.99. However, if you want a more feature-rich option or a monitor with deeper contrast and stronger HDR, it may be worth stepping up to a higher-end model from the Odyssey line, such as the Odyssey G9—but it will cost you significantly more. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've been looking for a massive OLED TV with a massive discount, it doesn't get much better than the 77-inch Sony Bravia A95L OLED TV, currently going for $3,498 (originally $4,999.99). This is the lowest price this premium TV has ever reached, according to price-tracking tools.\n The 77-inch Bravia A95L uses the same QD-OLED panel technology that has been successful with Samsung's OLED TVs, and it combines it with their best-in-class Cognitive Processor XR. This makes the color volume, peak brightness in HDR content, and motion handling one of the best in OLED TVs, even in 2026. This makes it a great OLED TV for people who want a premium theater TV that can also look great while gaming. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe A95L comes with the Google TV smart interface, which is my personal favorite since it makes casting to the TV from your phone or laptop easy, and has an internal microphone for hands-free voice control. There aren't many options for 77-inch premium OLED TVs, and even fewer that have withstood the test of time.

As a reader, a writer, and the editor of an article-driven tech site, the rise of user-generated video and streaming can be a tough reality to accept. But as a longtime fan of live streaming, a part of me is thrilled to see the media landscape begin to take it more seriously. For example: On Jan. 16, Bluesky announced the rollout of a feature that more seamlessly connects its users to live streams—a feature that may catch on more broadly. The latest Bluesky update, v1.114, allows streamers to display their \"Live Now\" status directly on the social network, a feature previously launched to beta testers back in May 2025. Now widely available, the feature makes it easier to connect to social audiences across platforms: Users can click a Bluesky profile's \"Live Now\" status and be directed straight to that profile's associated Twitch stream. (The feature currently works only with Twitch, but is expected to expand to other live streaming platforms soon.)\n    Other social apps punish links — we think linking out should be easy. Live Now is part of how we're making that happen. \nWhile in beta, Live Now is currently limited to Twitch links. Support for other streaming platforms may follow as we learn from the beta.— Bluesky (@bsky.app) January 15, 2026 at 2:00 PM\n\n\"Live Now\" arrives just as Bluesky saw an increase in users this week, following a major X outage and scrutiny of the platform's ongoing deepfake porn problem. Regardless of what it could mean for Bluesky's overall growth, I'm optimistic about any pro-discovery feature that can be adopted more broadly. I can imagine a future where more sites refer its users to live streaming platforms. Consider a Gmail avatar letting me know when a YouTuber is online, a Spotify artist page pointing me to a musician's stream, or an article byline pointing me to a live video on Substack. I hope that the bridge between my social feed and live streams continues to get shorter.\nHow to enable the \"Live Now\" badge on BlueskyTo turn on the \"Live Now\" badge on your Bluesky avatar, click the three-dot menu on the top-right of your profile page on desktop or mobile. From the list of options, choose the  \"Go Live\" option and paste a link to your Twitch profile page. The duration of your temporary \"Live\" badge is customizable, ranging from 5 minutes to 4 hours. Choose your preferred duration, and click \"Go Live.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jordan Calhoun / Lifehacker\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jordan Calhoun / Lifehacker\n                    \n    \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

They're also often low quality, AI-generated, misinformation, or some combination of the bunch, and may have a negative impact on our attention spans and mental health. In short, they're just not that good for us. It's bad enough for grown adults to control their scrolling habits, but it's another thing entirely for children, which poses quite the a challenge.It's easy enough to ban short-form video apps entirely, like TikTok. But what about apps that have short-form content as just one pillar of the overall package? Take YouTube: You might not mind your child having limited access to the app or site to watch long-form content you approve of, but having Shorts always in the way throws a wrench in that system. Any type of short-form video feed would be an issue here, but YouTube Shorts is particularly egregious, allowing kids to watch some truly horrific content, often generated by AI. Choosing whether your kids watch YouTube ShortsLuckily, YouTube finally appears to be giving parents some control here. As spotted by TechCrunch, YouTube announced updates to its parental controls on Wednesday. While there are a few changes on the way, the headline for me concerns Shorts. Not only will YouTube let parents choose a timer for how often their kids can watch Shorts, they can choose to set the timer to zero—effectively blocking Shorts for their kids' and teens' accounts. \nThis should be welcome news to any parents struggling to limit the short-form video content their kids are watching. You can let them watch other types of videos on YouTube Kids, or even standard YouTube if its a teen account, without worrying about them going down short-form video rabbit holes for hours. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe control here can be even more granular than an outright ban, too. Since you're always in control of the timer, YouTube says you can customize timers based on the scenario: You could set the Shorts timer to zero during homework time, then offer 30 minutes of scrolling after dinner. You could bump that to 60 minutes on weekends, or when in the car. If your child is under a supervised account, you'll also be able to control both custom Bedtime and \"Take a Break\" reminders. This is not the first time YouTube has offered users more control over Shorts. Last week, the company rolled out a new search filter that lets you choose to only see long-form videos in any given result, and since October, you've been able to limit the number of shorts you can watch in a day. YouTube, and parent company Google, are also expanding parental controls and enhancing protections for kids and teens. YouTube now uses AI to guess your age, and, if it believes you're under 18, will add restrictions to your account. Google also gives parents more control over supervised accounts: Previously, teens could choose to remove supervision after turning 13, but now, they need their parents to sign off on it too.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This update addresses 114 vulnerabilities in total, including three zero-days (bugs that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before an official fix is available from the developer). As reported by BleepingComputer, security flaws were found across the following categories: 57 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, three security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 22 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, 22 information disclosure vulnerabilities, two denial of service vulnerabilities, and five spoofing vulnerabilities. Six of the remote code execution vulnerabilities and two of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" Your machine should receive security updates automatically when Patch Tuesday drops, which is around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of the month. You can check to confirm by going to Start > Settings > Windows Update and selecting Check for Windows updates\nThree zero-days patched in JanuaryOne of the three zero-days fixed this month has been actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, labeled CVE-2026-20805, is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Desktop Windows Manager that allows attackers access to memory addresses from a remote ALPC port. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) have been credited with identifying this bug. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other two zero-days have been publicly disclosed. CVE-2026-21265 is a security bypass feature vulnerability that allows threat actors to bypass Secure Boot on systems that have not updated certificates issued in 2011 and nearing expiration. CVE-2023-31096 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in third-party Agere Soft Modem drivers that ship with supported Windows operating systems installed. Microsoft has removed these drivers from Windows. Microsoft released other non-security updates today, as well as additional patches for Microsoft Edge and Mariner vulnerabilities earlier this month.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.POP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.How to keep your third-party accounts working in GmailIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.Use IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.The IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

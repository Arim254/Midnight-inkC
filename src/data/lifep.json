You can now pick this versatile, reliable streaming box for $74.99 on Amazon, down from its original price of $99.99.\nLifehacker's review of the device highlights the smoothness of the user interface, the wealth of onboard storage, the bonus of having an Ethernet port (for steady internet access), and the benefits of the improved remote control—which you can actually make sound an alarm if you lose it. (Invaluable!)I've been using and loving Google TV for years, and the Google Streamer is a great way to access it. I like its broad support for multiple streaming apps, and the way it combines all those apps together—making it easy to see what you're currently watching. You can add to your watchlist from all across Google apps and services too, including Google Search.The streaming box and its associated remote are available in either Porcelain or Haze, so you can pick whichever matches your personal taste and internal decor. This 25% Black Friday discount may not last, so if you're interested, I'd recommend getting this bought as soon as possible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It's always at hand, can capture photos, videos, and voice notes as well as text, and is able to log locations, trips and more. Its new AI tools can even draft a few entries automatically for you.What's more, your phone probably now comes with a journal app preinstalled: Apple's Journal app launched in 2023, and a brand new Journal app from Google, initially exclusive to the Pixel 10, is now available on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 too (apparently because these phones also have Gemini Nano on board). Plus, a wide selection of third-party options is available on the Android and iOS app stores.In recent days, in an attempt to determine whether or not journaling on my phone might be for me, I've tested out both the Apple and Google offerings, as well as some of the best third-party alternatives. Here's what I found, and which apps I'd recommend if you want to log your thoughts and feelings on your phone.\nThe built-in optionsJournal by AppleLet's start with Journal by Apple, launched in December 2023. It's fair to say there haven't been a ton of updates released for the app since then, but all of the essentials are covered: Your journal entries can combine text, photos, videos, audio, locations, and sketches, and you can even set up multiple journals for different purposes.I do like the way this app makes suggestions for journaling, particularly in terms of recent locations and photos—it means it's easier to get started or to jump back in after a while. There are also a good number of options for what you can attach to your journal entries, and I can see myself using the mood slider a lot.\n    \n            \n            Journaling with Apple.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJournal by GoogleAs for the Journal app that Google recently launched for Android, it is limited to those with a phone from the Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 series. It's also pretty bare bones: I was able to log text, photos, videos, and places, as well as fitness data collected through Health Connect, but there's nothing here for audio or moods.In addition, the interface is rather plain—much more spartan than the Apple equivalent. You do get a neat overview of all your posts, but it's not particularly inspiring, and you can't configure multiple journals. In addition, the AI-powered prompts for what to write about remain exclusive to Pixel 10 handsets, so you have to do without these on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9.\n    \n            \n            Google's Journal app sticks to the basics.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNeither of these are bad apps; each will do the job of getting down your thoughts in a digital format, with some useful extras attached. The biggest benefits are they're both well integrated into their respective operating systems, and you don't need new accounts to use them. Apple's journal app is certainly better than Google's at the moment, though it's had a two-year head start.If you just want something quick and simple that's made by the company that made your phone (and that may well come preinstalled on your phone), then they're fine. However, these two journal apps remain rather bare bones compared to the other options, as well as keeping you locked in on either Android or iOS. That's why, if you're serious about your journaling, I think it's worth exploring a third-party app installed.The best third-party journal appsDay One\n    \n            \n            Day One was one of the first mobile journals to appear.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOutside of Google and Apple, Day One (Android and iOS) has long been one of the best journaling apps around—and you can take it with you if you ever jump between the Apple and Google platforms. It's been around since 2011 and is stacked with features, including multiple view types, prompts, tags, summaries, recaps, and a gorgeous design that looks great on every device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYour entries can include all the usual features, plus weather details, playlists, health data, social media posts, and more. You get a lot for free, but there is also a premium plan available for $50 a year. It gives you support for unlimited images, videos, and audio, plus extras like the ability to create journal entries over email.5 Minute Journal\n    \n            \n            5 Minute Journal focuses on positivity.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAs someone just dipping a toe into the world of journaling, 5 Minute Journal (Android and iOS) appeals right from the name. The idea is you don't have to spend too long jotting down your thoughts and ideas each day, and the app is geared towards getting you to record the more positive aspects of your life, boosting mindfulness and well-being.I like the writing prompts and journaling reminders this app provides to keep you motivated, as well as the really simple way you can log your mood as you go. It's also a beautifully designed and organized app—a completely different aesthetic experience than a more utilitarian option like Google Journal. However, some features (including unlimited photos and videos) requires a premium subscription, which starts at $5 a month.Rosebud Journal\n    \n            \n            Rosebud comes with a few AI prompt extras.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne more recommendation from my own experience: Rosebud (Android and iOS). It's branded as \"AI-powered\" but thankfully you don't have to worry too much about that, and it does a really nice job of summarizing and tracking your thoughts over time, as well as encouraging you to jot stuff down in the here and now.The app does quite a bit of hand-holding and prompting, but that's perfect if you're just getting started or struggling to journal each day, and you can always just  jot down standard journal entries with text and images if you prefer. As you might have guessed given the other options on my list, there is a pro-level subscription for $13 a month that gives you a lot more insights in terms of past entries, trends, and emotional patterns and triggers, if an AI's summary of your life is interesting to you.The best journal app is the one you useOne of the benefits of there being so many journal apps out there is that there really is something for everyone, so there's no harm in testing out Google and Apple's offerings first—they are, after all, completely free. But for journaling apps that really invest in user design and features, there are much better options out there. Now I just need to pick the one I'm going to stick with, because in the end, the best journal app is the one that you use consistently. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I recently used AI to incorporate her art into physical gifts. If you want to achieve the same quality with a meaningful family photo, here's how you can utilize Adobe's new upscaling features to get the best results.\nFor this process, I used Adobe Firefly and Photoshop. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's generative AI application, and the company released a phone app this summer to help you create on the go. If you're a total newbie to Firefly, you can just ask the app for help along the way. Photoshop, which has long been the gold standard for image editing, recently added an AI upscaling feature that can improve scanned photos or images with the click of a button. Here's how I did it.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nHow I used Adobe AI features to make giftsI started by using Adobe Firefly to visualize my mom’s art on various products, including aprons, scarves, and even dresses. Seeing mockup options helped me decide on an apron as the perfect first piece.Next, I brought an image of an original painting into Photoshop and used the AI upscaling feature. Wearables require a much larger print size, and this step ensures every detail stays crisp and vibrant. I then uploaded the file to Printful, a print-on-demand platform. You can also use Printify or a different print-on-demand provider, as the process is nearly identical.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn just a few clicks, the apron was ready to print and ship directly, and it was such a pleasure to see my mom wear her own artwork. With technology and AI, we’ve been able to take her creations beyond the canvas and share them with people everywhere, making every gift feel personal, meaningful, and timeless.

But sometimes a company saves a few special things for later, and that turned out to be the case here: These two brand-new watches, released earlier this year, are now both $100 off. I've used and reviewed the Forerunner 570, and found it a step up from the earlier Forerunner 265 (which I also loved). The 570 adds a microphone and two different types of voice assistants, plus some new software features like heat acclimation and the ability to trim your activity if you didn't press \"stop\" when you crossed the race finish line. My only complaint is (or was) that the price seemed a bit steep in comparison to the previous model. But with the current deal, it's a lot closer to the original price of the 265: The 570 is now going for $449.99.\nThe Forerunner 970 is also $100 off, which brings its current price to $649.99. The biggest thing the 970 has going for it over the 570 is that it can show you maps while you run. Both watches can do breadcrumb tracking (drawing a line showing where you've been), but with a fully map-enabled watch, you can see important details like where your hiking route crosses roads or turns along them. The 970 also has an LED flashlight, which is incredibly handy for getting around in the dark—whether that means snuggling into your sleeping bag at a campsite or just sneaking out of your kid's room at bedtime.\nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Not only can you save yourself from more expensive heating bills with thoughtful weatherproofing, but you can also be more confident in the event of winter storms or simply more comfortable when you choose to stay indoors. Keeping your house warm, cozy, and safe for the winter is made easier by addressing potential problems early through simple checks and chores now. Here are all the home maintenance tasks you should do in November.1) Add vent covers to your vents and crawlspacesWhen the weather gets colder, wild animals seek a good place to shelter for the winter. If you have uncovered vents or crawl spaces, they can prove to be an inviting spot for creatures. To keep them out, see that you have vent covers in place and that crawl spaces or any other exterior nooks and crannies are sealed up or covered with a sturdy metal mesh. If you don't have vent covers installed, consider adding them. This method will help defend against squirrels, raccoons, rats, mice, birds, and bats.2) Change the batteries in your fire and carbon monoxide alarmsIf you have non-wired smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, change the batteries once a year—even before they begin making the annoying low-battery beep, if you're up for it. While you're at it, check your various hazard detection systems to ensure they work properly. Since people spend more time indoors during the colder months, there is an elevated risk of fire from the use of heaters, candles, and cooking. Additionally, keeping windows closed and sealed can increase the risk of carbon monoxide accumulation inside. Giving your detectors a once-over can help reduce your risk.\n3) Install weatherproofing to doors and windowsIf you live in an older home or have windows or doors that aren’t well-insulated, November is a good time to weatherproof problem areas. Begin by inspecting the weatherstripping around doors and windows, checking for leaks, broken, or worn stripping. If you find any gaps, use replacement weather stripping to seal them. If you have bigger leaks around windows or doors, or older windows that let in too much air, you can also use a weatherization kit to temporarily seal off leaky openings with heat-shrinking plastic wrap. This basic weatherproofing will keep you warmer and help save money on utility bills.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n4) Organize your winter weather suppliesIf you live in an area that can get a lot of snow and ice in the winter, stock up on ice melt, shovels, and roof rakes. Take a look at your snow removal tools and make sure they’re in good shape before it’s time to use them, as replacing equipment before a storm can save you a lot of headache later. It's also a good time to stash your ice scraper, snow brush, and snow chains in your car's trunk. If you live in an area with heavy snowfall and ice, consider keeping a scraper and de-icer in your garage or utility room, so you can access them if your vehicle becomes frozen over.5) Clean ovens, toasters, and other crumb-catching appliancesKitchen fires can be caused by ovens, toasters, and other cooking appliances that have crumbs and other burnt food deposits. Since people tend to stay home and use their ovens more during colder months—not to mention entertain more during the holiday season—ovens and toasters can get a more intense workout this time of year. Checking that your appliances are clean and hazard-free in November can save you from a disaster down the road, not to mention that you'll be happier with cleaner appliances and less work during spring cleaning season.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Scammers love to impersonate government and law enforcement officials, from the FBI to the U.S. Marshals Service to Medicare and other health insurance programs. There's a good reason for this: Most Americans use government services at some point, and many may be apt to trust, or at least engage with, someone claiming to be from a well-known agency. Plus, the threat of losing benefits or being targeted by legal action is especially compelling when it comes from a government representative, and victims may be more likely to comply with scammers' demands. It's no surprise, then, that schemes currently making the rounds involve Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits, according to warnings from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Social Security numbers are often part of identity theft, so it would be alarming to receive a notice that yours has been involved in criminal activity. Scammers are counting on this when impersonating the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and trying to trick you into actually giving up your SSN and other sensitive information.  \nHere's how the scheme works: Fraudsters are sending emails with the subject line \"Alert: Social Security Account Issues Detected\" and including attachments on letterhead that looks like it comes from the OIG. The notice contains official-seeming information, such as a reference number and case ID, and states that your SSN will be suspended within 24 hours due to fraudulent activity on your account. The letter also says that criminal charges have been filed and even includes the statutes that have supposedly been violated. Recipients are instructed to call the number listed to \"respond to these allegations,\" but the person on the other end is a scammer impersonating an SSA employee. They will try to exploit your fear and confusion to collect personal and financial information from you. VA benefits overpayment scamScammers are also contacting veterans and military family members who receive VA benefits, claiming that said benefits have been overpaid and pressuring targets to pay back the money owed. According to the VA's advisory, fraudsters are using fake VA letterhead and logos on notices sent by mail and email as well as spoofing real VA phone numbers. They are trying to convince beneficiaries to make payments immediately using methods like wire transfers, cryptocurrency, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards, and they may also request sensitive information your VA login or bank account credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile VA benefits could legitimately be overpaid, the VA won't contact you and demand money—especially via bitcoin and other unrecoverable methods. Nor should you ever have to pay an upfront fee for assistance with managing VA debts and claims (the VA does this for free). If you do actually owe money, you will be able to find more information on repayment through your official VA.gov account. Always verify through official VA channels, such as VA.gov and the VA’s Debt Management Center (800-827-0648). Never rely solely on unsolicited communication, and never give out your password, SSN, or financial information. Government agencies don't send threatening notices via email (or by any other means), so if you receive a scary letter out of the blue, don't act without investigating. Always contact the agency via the information found on its website—don't call or text any number provided in these notices.   \n            ",

This year, Amazon's Black Friday deal event is taking place from Nov. 20-28, and Lifehacker will be here with all the best deals throughout the mega-sale. Right now, one of them is on my absolute favorite headphones for running—the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. They're currently $124.95, a 31% discount off their list price of $179.95.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the world of bone conduction headphones (BCH), let me try to convert you. I love noise-cancelling tech when I'm in the gym, sure. But when I'm exercising outside, I'm grateful for BCH technology to keep my ears open to traffic, other runners, and reckless cyclists—all without sacrificing audio quality. As my colleague Daniel Oropeza reviews in-depth here, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are the best set of BCHs that either of us have ever tried.With these Shokz, I've experienced little to no ear fatigue, even during 20+ mile runs. I've worn these headphones for over a year now, through humid summer runs and unexpected downpours, and they're holding up great. Most important for me, their battery life holds up, lasting even my longest training runs. Even if I forget to charge the night before a run, a quick five-minute charge gives me around 1.5 hours of listening time. Shokz is a go-to brand for a reason, and this 31% discount could be the nudge you need to snag the OpenRun Pro 2 headphones for yourself.If you're still shopping around, I recommend checking out guides like our live blog, where we use price trackers to make sure you're really getting the best deals this Black Friday. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and sales run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

I stumbled upon this older one by Epicka and bought it almost without thinking, something I rarely do. That turned out to be one of my best purchase decisions ever, because that travel adapter is still going strong. I've taken it to multiple countries and have used it extensively while traveling to remote locations in India, where you don't always have a reliable power supply. Last year, I gave it away to a friend I met during a meditation retreat, and she's been happily using it since then.This is the first time I've had a travel adapter for that long. I'd bought a few crappy ones before and they couldn't always reliably charge multiple devices or last very long. This Epicka unit was quite impressive in that regard, but it did have a couple of limitations. It was a fairly slow charger, and it had only one USB-C port. I've been looking to upgrade to a better travel adapter for about a year now, and I think I'm going to do it this time. Epicka has another model with three USB-C ports and support for up to 75W charging, which makes it ideal for me. That one is now down to its lowest ever price in an early Black Friday deal.\nEven at the deal price of $45 (15% off), it is a bit pricey, but I think the premium is worth paying for a fast charger from a brand with a good track record. I will say that this product is a bit bulky and some people will prefer to travel with a more compact charging adapter, but its size never bothered me much. You also get two USB-A ports (one on each side) in this adapter, which is good for those with older charging cables.This Epicka universal travel adapter has a 4.8 rating on Amazon, with a total of 336 reviews at time of writing. The general consensus among Amazon reviewers is that this is a great product. One review says that if you charge multiple devices, this adapter splits power evenly across the devices, which means that all devices will be charged reasonably quickly. It has plugs for the US, UK, Australia, and EU, and a nice locking mechanism to keep the plugs in place.Note, though, that if you're planning to use high-wattage electronics such as hair dryers with this adapter, then it's not for you. This adapter is also not a voltage converter, so be sure to check if your electronics ship with a built-in converter when using the Epicka adapter in other countries. Most phone and laptop chargers are dual voltage, so you probably won't have to worry about it much, but safety first.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

They are on sale for $249 on Amazon (originally $299) until Dec. 1. \nIf you're not familiar, these smart glasses basically put a high-definition display in your pocket, projecting the equivalent of a 201-inch TV in front of your face—so if someone on your list is tech-inclined and you want to blast 'em with a pure \"whoa\" present, here you go. They'll even fit in a stocking.There are other glasses that do the same thing, but the Ray Neo Air 3 Pro hit a nice sweet spot between inexpensive and good quality. Check out my review if you want to read about these glasses in more depth, but the bottom line is: if you want to make every flight you'll ever take better or stream videos and games in private, these glasses will do the trick.

Even better, the 2024 version was updated with a new screen, and a trendy new \"matcha\" color option.Currently, you can get the base Kindle 16GB model with Lockscreen Ads for $79.99. That’s a $30 discount off the usual price of $109.99. The model without Lockscreen Ads is also discounted to $99.99 (down from $129.99). This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the base Kindle, ever. That makes this pretty tempting, since because the Kindle is already one of the cheapest e-readers out there, it doesn’t go on sale that often.\nThe 2024 Kindle comes with a 6-inch e-Ink display with 16GB storage and a screen with 94 nits of brightness (25% brighter than before). The new updated screen with 300 PPI pixel density is also now as bright as the Kindle Paperwhite, which retails for $159.99 (and is currently discounted to $124). There’s also an updated processor that promises faster page turns. It still offers the same 6-week long battery life, too. The Kindle measures 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches (HWD) and weighs 157 grams. The device has a USB-C port for charging and manually transferring books and files. The 16GB storage should be good for thousands of books.The Amazon Kindle comes with the standard Kindle software, where ebooks bought using Amazon will show up automatically on your device. You can also use Amazon’s Send to Kindle feature to wirelessly transfer your own books to the Kindle. There’s also Goodreads integration and a recommendation engine to help you discover more books to read.In PCMag's review, the Amazon Kindle (2024) received a 3.5-star “Good” rating. PCMag noted that “We like its small size and consistent lighting, and even though it isn't as fast as the Paperwhite, it works perfectly well.”If you have the extra $70 to spend, you can also consider the Kindle Paperwhite, which comes with a bigger screen, faster page turns, a waterproof body, a longer battery life, and the option for warm backlighting.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you.

I like its heft, ergonomics, and the fact that I don't have to keep replacing AA batteries to use it. And while the DualSense works best with the PS5, it's also a great controller for your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android devices. If you've been eyeing one, then Black Friday 2025 is a great time to buy the PS5's DualSense controller.\nDuring the Black Friday 2025 sale on Amazon, the PS5's DualSense controller is going for $54 to $59 (25% to 32% off), depending on which color you choose. That's a great price for a fuss-free controller that works with multiple devices. I've used my DualSense controller with my PS5, my PC, and my iPhone, and enjoyed it on all devices. I have a tendency to get sucked into long, story-driven games, and as a result, I used the DualSense for my second 120-hour playthrough of Persona 5 Royal. The controller worked flawlessly, and I never felt tired holding it during these playthroughs.The DualSense controller has a USB-C port for charging, which is quite convenient to use, but do note that you don't get a cable with this device. Still, if you have any other device that uses USB-C for charging, then you can reuse the same cable to charge this controller. If you couldn't tell from the name, the DualSense's haptic feedback is especially well-done, as it's a lot more than some mild or intense vibrations. The feedback changes subtly based on what you're doing in-game—try playing the PS5's free Astro's Playroom game to get an idea of the DualSense's capabilities.The controller also has an integrated touch pad, accelerometer, and gyroscope, which means that it can also be used for motion controls. Don't forget that you get a built-in microphone in the DualSense controller, but if you don't want to accidentally record yourself, you can turn off the mic in your PS5's settings.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It's a convenient way to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods wirelessly and all at once. This Anker Prime charging station is among the most expensive of its kind, but I also think that it's the best one you can buy. With this year's Black Friday deals, it's finally more affordable, making it a great time to snag one. \nThe Anker Prime is down to $150 this Black Friday, which is a cool $80 off the list price, and the lowest price it's ever had. While you can still find lots alternatives for around $50-$100, this product has plenty of reasons to splurge on it. Aside from conveniently charging all your Apple devices at once, it supports fast 25W wireless charging, has a fan for active cooling to protect the battery, and it has a tiny screen on the front that lets you switch charging modes, check how much power each device is drawing, and see what your charging temperatures look like.As for why 25W charging is worth it, while wireless charging is generally a lot slower than wired charging, that's starting to change. You can now charge your iPhone 16 or 17 series devices at 25W wirelessly, up from 15W for previous models. This means that your iPhone will charge a lot faster with a compatible fast wireless charger, and the Anker Prime is one of the few multi-device charging stations to support 25W fast charging for your iPhone. It can also fast charge your Apple Watch Series 7 or newer device and Apple Watch Ultra. If you have an Apple Watch SE or an older Series model, the charging speeds will be slower.It's worth noting that you need AirPods with a wireless charging case if you want to use them with the Anker Prime. Also, remember that the iPhone 16e does not have support for wireless charging, so it's not compatible with this product. And while you also theoretically may be use the Anker Prime to charge your Android phone or other devices that support wireless charging, Anker doesn't recommend doing so, as this product has been designed specifically for Apple products.My biggest worry with these products is overheating and fan noise. Thanks to active cooling, the charging station will keep your iPhone's temperatures in check. And while the fan will kick in while fast charging, that won't be a problem during a slow overnight charge. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

It's the best non-Ultra smartwatch for your iPhone and, in my experience, its fitness-related features are excellent. This Black Friday deal brings the Series 11 down to $339 (15% off), which is an excellent price for a brand new Apple Watch.\nThe Series 11 is available in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm; and two variants: GPS, and GPS+Cellular. At time of writing, the best deal is on the 42mm GPS variant. All other variants are more lightly discounted, but be aware that your favorite color may not be discounted during this Black Friday 2025 sale.The key to finding great Apple deals is to buy from third-party retailers, and that's true for this Apple Watch Series 11 deal as well. Amazon's Black Friday 2025 sales have it cheapest right now.Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt said she loves the Apple Watch Series 11, but admittedly, she doesn't recommend it to those who already have a Series 10. If you have an Apple Watch that's a few years old, the Series 11 is worth buying, but it's hasn't taken a big enough leap ahead to justify annual upgrades.The Series 11 is thin, light, and plenty comfortable to wear all day. It has support for hypertension notifications, ECG recording, built-in GPS for tracking outdoor workouts, and an Ion-X display that's more scratch resistant than that of older Apple Watch models. It also has improved battery life compared to the Series 10.While it's common knowledge at this point, I still think it's worth mentioning that the Apple Watch only works with iPhones. You can't even pair it with an iPad or a Mac, so this device is only for iPhone users. If that sounds like you, this is a great opportunity for an upgrade.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.

This $100 discount makes Sony’s next-gen VR headset feel a lot more accessible, especially for PS5 owners who’ve been on the fence. \nThe bundle includes the full VR2 setup and a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain, a title built specifically to show off what the hardware can do. PCMag gave the PS VR2 an \"outstanding\" rating for good reason—this is a big leap from Sony’s first attempt at VR, with sharper visuals, better motion tracking, and more immersive gameplay.The PS VR2 runs at a resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 per eye, with a 120Hz refresh rate and full 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) tracking. Translation: It feels smooth and looks sharp, even during fast-paced movement. The eye-tracking tech is surprisingly useful, helping menus feel more intuitive and making foveated rendering possible (basically, games focus the highest resolution where you're actually looking). Setup is easy, and the build is lightweight, so it doesn’t take long to get going, and it doesn’t weigh your head down during longer sessions. The included Sense controllers are responsive and add physical feedback that makes everything from climbing to archery in Horizon feel a bit more tactile.That said, there are a few caveats. The PS VR2 only works with a PlayStation 5, and it isn’t backward-compatible with original PS VR games. So, if you already have a VR library from the first generation, you won’t be able to carry it over. The game library is growing, but it's still catching up to PC-based systems. Even so, for anyone new to VR or upgrading from older hardware, this bundle is one of the best values we’ve seen. At $299, you're getting one of the most polished VR experiences available right now, without diving into PC setups or spending double the price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Does Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

That's a lot of laptop in return for relatively little outlay, and there won't be many better value deals on offer this week.\nI've recently written about the reasons why I often prefer picking up my Chromebook rather than firing up my Windows 11 or macOS computers: These ChromeOS machines are lightweight, fast, bloat-free, and always online. Everything you do on them is instantly saved to the cloud, making it easy to sync your work across computers.Sure, you can of course install Google Chrome on a Microsoft or Apple laptop and then get ChromeOS plus all the extras—but a lot of the time, I don't really need those extras. All I want is a fast window on the web, without background programs or software updates or any other distractions getting in the way.This 15.6-inch Acer laptop meets the Chromebook Plus standard for a superior ChromeOS experience, and you even get a year of Google AI Pro (normally $20 a month) included for free. If you weren't aware, Chromebooks can also run Android apps, which means there's even more you can do with this portable computer.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

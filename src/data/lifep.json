Toss in the fact that those plans to authenticate real users have now been replaced by a paid verification scheme, and it's clear the site is still figuring out how to deal with fake users. The most recent plan? Put a bunch of your personal information in an \"About this account\" section on your profile page.In an X post this week, X head of product Nikita Bier said that starting next week, the social media site will begin \"experimenting with displaying new information on profiles.\" This includes which country a user is based in, when they joined the site, how many times they've changed their username, and how they're accessing the site (via desktop or via the app, for instance).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe idea, Bier says, is that checking this information will allow users to \"to verify [an account's] authenticity.\" For instance, if you're being spammed with a bunch of suspicious followers, and they all seem to be new accounts from the same region, you might be able to infer that you're being targeted by some kind of coordinated spam attack.At the same time, however, the new section comes with privacy concerns. One user, for instance, asked Bier if X accounts will be able to opt out of having the country they're based in displayed for all to see. Another, seemingly in favor of the new system, asked if the page could include information about which device a user is posting from, to which Bier replied that the team is \"experimenting with various device details for users to form judgments on authenticity.\" Yikes.While none of that is quite as aggressive as just posting your address, it still peels back the curtain a bit more than I'd like, and leaves room for others to make judgments about you based on geography, or if Bier follows through on that second point, your model of phone.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLuckily, the feature isn't guaranteed to make it live for everyone quite yet. Bier says that the initial test will begin with \"a handful of X team members to get feedback.\" And to his credit, he has been responsive in replies to his post, acknowledging that in \"countries where speech can have penalties, we should substitute country for region.\"If the new section rubs you the wrong way, now's the time to speak up about it. If, however, it does make its way towards your profile one day, there is a silver lining. Bier says that should you not want certain information made public on your profile, \"There will be privacy toggles.\" However, if a user configures them, he says \"that will likely be highlighted on their profile.\"For my own two cents, I have essentially moved on from X at this point, and bots have been a big reason why. Still, I'm not sure encouraging users to judge each other based on where they're located (or even username changes, which are common during spooky season) is the right move. While some countries are more associated with inauthentic accounts than others, real users live everywhere, and implying that readers should dismiss others based simply on where they are runs the risk of adding more toxicity to the pile. Take this bizarre reply to Bier's announcement, which implies that...Canada?...is full of trolls.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Pop in, get the shot, then go about my day. That process has now gotten even easier: Last year, the FDA approved the first flu vaccine that you can administer yourself, or that parents can administer to their children, and it's now available for at-home ordering. I just placed my order. And best of all: It’s a nasal spray, so no needles.How can you get the at-home flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine, called FluMist, still needs to be prescribed by a medical provider. But since nearly everyone aged two through 49 is eligible, FluMist’s maker (AstraZeneca) has a telehealth website that bundles the provider's approval with an order to an online pharmacy. The process takes about five minutes on average, they say, and I found that to be accurate. I've already had my flu shot this year, but my kids haven't gotten it yet. (I also know my daughter strongly prefers the nasal to the injection when possible.) The website allowed me to add multiple people to the same order, so I filled out the questionnaire for each child, giving their names, ages, allergies, and so on. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe website then reached into some big data cloud out there and told me it already knew their insurance information (existentially frightening, yet convenient!) and presented me with my bill: an $8.99 fee, which included $2.50 for physician evaluation and $6.49 for shipping and processing. Insurance covers the cost of the vaccine itself. Who can use the at-home flu vaccine? The at-home vaccine is the same as regular FluMist, which is approved for ages two through 49. That means babies and older adults will still need to visit a provider for the regular, injectable flu vaccine. Children can get flu shots starting at the age of six months.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFluMist uses a live, weakened virus. It can't give you the actual flu, but it can cause some respiratory symptoms in people with weakened immune systems. So it's not recommended for people who are pregnant, have certain medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have close contact with an immunocompromised person. If that's you, talk to a provider about your best options. You may be advised to get the regular injectable type, which doesn't include any live virus. How do you give yourself the at-home flu vaccine? Mine hasn't arrived yet, but the instructions say that a package containing the vaccine will arrive at my door on the day I selected. It will be packed in an insulated container with cold packs, and should be put in the refrigerator upon arrival. There's also a tag I can scan to make sure the vaccine stayed at the proper temperature during the shipping process. Assuming that all goes well, you follow the instructions to spray the vaccine up your nose. (If you've gotten a FluMist at a pharmacy, it's the same idea.) Adults can administer it to themselves, and children will need an adult to do it for them. Instructions are, of course, provided. After you administer the vaccine, there is a prepaid envelope you can use to return the sprayers for disposal.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

In the end, it just depends on my mood. Good news for people like me: Tonal is rolling out reformer-style Pilates with its new update. If you have the at-home weight training device or are considering getting one, this could be major for you. Even if you're not someone who wakes up on a Saturday morning excited to go trade $65 for 45 minutes on the reformer—or you've never even tried Pilates at all—this is nice because it can allow you to give it a whirl from the comfort of your home, using the same device you use for more traditional strength training. Led by yoga and Pilates instructor Kristin McGee, the classes are broken down by experience level and, like all Tonal workouts, customized to your strength. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow Tonal's Pilates classes feelI got to test out the new Pilates offering last week, which was exciting because I don't have a Tonal machine (yet, since I'm planning to get one) but also daunting because, well, I don't have a Tonal machine. I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew, broadly, that these are digital devices you stick to your wall, calibrate, and work out with basically like you would with your gym's cable machine. They use magnetic resistance to increase and decrease the weight that you're pulling on. \nFirst, I did a few regular lifting exercises so the machine could determine how strong I am. Any user will do these same four exercises to get a baseline. From then on, the machine will set up all weights for all exercises to align with what that person can do, progressively increasing the weight over time as the user gets stronger. Then it was Pilates time. The big difference between the new Pilates offerings and the traditional strength training on Tonal is the same difference you find when you compare using a cable machine to using a reformer: With the Pilates moves, the resistance gets harder as you push or pull, whether because of the springs on the reformer or the settings on the Tonal. I did some leg circles, some hundreds, and a handful of other standard Pilates moves—and besides the fact I was laying flat on the floor and interacting with a big digital machine, it did feel pretty similar to using a reformer. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Tonal Pilates specsThis program won't be out officially for Tonal users until Nov. 17, but you can order your loop attachments now. Made in partnership with Pilates Loops, they cost $100 and are similar to the straps you get on a standard reformer. There's a long loop, a short loop, and a knot you can grab farther down, depending on the exercise you're doing and how intense you want it to be. Beyond the loops, no further equipment upgrade is necessary—software updates will hit Tonal 1 and Tonal 2 machines in November. The Pilates upgrade will work with the digital weight technology that comes along in all the equipment and will go up to 10 resistance levels. The machine makes small adjustments as you work through the moves, which are presented and demonstrated by McGee, so if you're having a hard time or something is too easy, the adjustments are automatic. Tonal did already offer mat Pilates classes and while I love those, they're not quite the same as fighting against a machine custom-built for the struggle, which is why I still find myself trekking to a studio a few times a week even though I have access to mat Pilates classes through YouTube, Peloton, and my gym. The addition of this programming adds a more in-depth option for anyone looking for a workout that's easy on the joints, engages the core, and boosts mobility and balance. A Tonal 2 costs $4,295 and a monthly membership runs you $60. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.Against all cybersecurity advice to the contrary, right next to my computer is a piece of paper with the password to my Google account written on it. Why? Well, if I forget it, what am I gonna do? Send a recovery email to my Gmail that I can't log into? It seems Google's aware of that little problem, because while it does have other workarounds on its account recovery page (like providing a mobile number that you've hopefully already linked to your account), now it's letting you use your friends' and family's emails to help you recover your Google accounts instead.Google is calling these emails \"Recovery Contacts,\" and you can set them up now. Just navigate to your Google Account's security settings (or click here) to get started. From the Recovery Contacts page, click the button to add a contact, then enter someone you trust (you'll see several suggestions) and send them a request to be a Recovery Contact for you. Once they accept it, they'll be able to help you get your account back if you ever find yourself unable to log in, but they'll have to jump through a few hoops that a normal recovery email wouldn't.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFirst, a Recovery Contact only has seven days to accept your invite, so if they missed your initial request, you'll have to send it again. Second, if they decline your request for whatever reason, you'll have to wait four days before you can send them a new one. Third, once they've actually accepted your request, you'll need to wait seven more days before they can actually help you recover your account.But once your friend or family member is set up as a Recovery Contact for you and through the waiting period, there are only a few steps left. It's not quite as convenient as a standard recovery email, but it's close. When trying to recover your account, select your recovery contract from the list of recovery options, or follow a prompt Google says may pop up to reach out to them. Then, select Get number. Your recovery contact will then get an email with three different numbers on their device. Give them the number you got within 15 minutes, have them select it, and you should be able to get back into your account on your own device. Or, if you missed that time window, you can simply get another number to try again.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNote, though, that like with other recovery methods, Google might require additional case-by-case verification that you are who you say you are. The company says that if this is the case, your account will be put on a temporary security hold, and you'll be notified that an account recovery request was made. It's a bit annoying, but the idea is that if someone else tries to use your recovery contact , you'll be able to deny them access to your account. Given that one of the steps here simply requires a 1/3rd chance guess, I suppose that makes sense. It's still more secure than my piece of paper.And speaking of security, if you ever find yourself not trusting a Recovery Contact as much as you once did, you can easily remove them from your list. Navigate to your Google Account's Security & sign-in page, then tap Recovery contacts, hit the Trash icon next to the account you want to remove, and hit Confirm. Note that a Recovery Contact won't get your standard security alerts or notifications, but it's still good practice to remove them if you no longer trust them.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Other times, the company simply drops the news on a random Wednesday morning. This Wednesday morning is one such example: Following a preview on social media, Apple has announced the M5 chip, as well as three products that will kick off this new era of Apple silicon: the M5 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pros, and Vision Pro.    The M5 chip The big news that unifies all updated Apple products today is the M5 chip. As the name might imply, this is the company's fifth generation of Apple silicon, its custom system on a chip (SoC). \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple is selling M5 as a chip optimized for AI. The company says the new 16-core Neural Engine delivers both performance and efficiency boosts for AI processes. That means Apple Intelligence features should be faster and more accurate, though I'm not sure that's enough to get me to use it. In addition, the chip's 10-core GPU has a dedicated \"Neural Accelerator\" in each core, which offers over four times peak GPU compute over the M4 chip, and six times the compute of M1. Apple specifically touts the improvements for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, which can now take advantage of \"accelerated processing\" for AI tasks, like running diffusion models and large language models. In other graphics gains, M5's GPU and enhanced shader cores can be up to 30% faster than M4 and up to 2.5 times faster than M1. It comes with Apple's third-gen ray-tracing engine, which offers a boost for any process that uses ray tracing to calculate lighting effects. Those improved graphics means the new Apple Vision Pro can render 10% more pixels as well as handle refresh rates up to 120Hz. M5's unified memory now has a bandwidth of 153GB/s, a nearly 30% jump over M4 and over 2x boost over M1, according to Apple. All devices running M5 can access the entire memory pool at once, which Apple says makes it possible to run larger AI models entirely on-device. That's great news for privacy for anyone using AI on these MacBooks, iPads, or Vision Pro. Users can configure M5 to come with up to 32GB of RAM.MacBook Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nApple did something interesting with its M5 kickoff for the Mac: It started only with the 14-inch MacBook Pro. If you want a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M5, you'll need to wait. This new 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with all the new performance gains that Apple advertises for the M5 chip, with some unique benefits as well. Apple says this machine has up to 24 hours of battery life, which, if true, would be huge: You could work two full 12-hour days before needing to find a charger for your MacBook. M5 also brings upgrades to the SSD in this MacBook Pro, which Apple says will help in professional workflows like importing RAW images to exporting huge video files.  Other than that, this is the same 14-inch MacBook Pro that you otherwise know by now. You get the Liquid Retina XDR display with a 12MP Center Stage camera, HDMI port, SD card slot, and three USB-C ports, in either silver or black. It even starts at the same $1,599 price as the M4 MacBook Pro, for the model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \niPad Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nLike the new MacBook Pro, the iPad Pro looks unchanged, save for the new M5 and its performance gains. But there's a little more under the hood here than just the new chip. Apple says the cellular iPad Pro models get the company's C1X modem, which can offer up to 50% faster cellular data performance. If you opt for the cellular iPads, that's good news, though I always opt for the wifi-only model, and use my iPhone as a hotspot. To each their own. In addition to the C1X, these new iPads also get the N1 chip, which supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Apple says N1 supports better performance on 5GHz networks, and boosts performance of features including AirDrop and Personal Hotspot. Apple says the 256GB and 512GB iPad Pros here start with 12GB of RAM. That's 4GB more than the M4 iPad Pros, which started at 8GB each. You'll also notice faster charging speeds on these new iPads: Apple says with the right adapter, such as the company's new dynamic power adapter, you can reach 50% battery in about 30 minutes. These iPads also now support external displays running at up to 120Hz.Vision Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nThe M5 chip is even coming to a refreshed Vision Pro. Apple's mixed-reality headset might not be the success story the company wanted, but it hasn't abandoned the device, either. To the contrary, this Vision Pro has a few upgrades here in addition to M5's performance, efficiency, and AI gains.As mentioned above, the new Vision Pro can now render 10% more pixels across its micro-OLED displays than the previous generation can. It can also boost the refresh rate to 120Hz when needed, which should help sell the virtual reality illusion, including when working with virtual displays.  But it's not just about the technology, here. Apple has upgraded the Vision Pro's headband—specifically, the Dual Knit Band. Apple says this band should be more comfortable, with \"3D-knitted\" upper and lower straps. The lower strap in particular provides a counterweight, which should help take some of the pressure off the user when wearing it. Unfortunately, this strap is a separate $99 purchase. Like the current Vision Pro, this model starts at $3,499 for 256GB of internal storage.All of these devices are available for pre-order starting today, and will be available in stores on Oct. 22.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

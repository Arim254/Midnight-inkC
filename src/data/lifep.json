    "body": "\n        \n        Contactless payment, also known as tap-to-pay, has become a fast, easy, and relatively common way to complete a transaction using your smartphone or credit card. It relies on Near Field Communication (NFC) to transmit data between your device and a payment terminal when the two are in close proximity, up to an inch or two away.While NFC technology does provide some additional security—transmitting a virtual account number instead of your actual card details, for example—scammers have found a way to capitalize on tap-to-pay to steal money from unsuspecting targets. These \"ghost tapping\" schemes may exploit both cards and mobile wallets. How tap-to-pay scams workAccording to the Better Business Bureau, ghost tapping takes advantage of a potential victim's proximity and lack of attention to detail. They suggest it is possible for a scammer to bump into you in a crowded public space, getting close enough to trigger a contactless transaction without your knowledge. (It's not clear how common a close brush with a tap-to-pay machine actually is.) \nBut other versions of ghost tapping rely on you to actively engage while missing the warning signs of fraud. For example, scammers might appear to be selling goods or collecting small donations for charity using tap-to-pay, but they are actually charging your card for a much larger amount to a fraudulent business. They count on you not to look closely at the transaction details before tapping, or they rush you through the process and fail to offer a receipt.  In one instance reported to the BBB's Scam Tracker, individuals were targeted by a door-to-door salesman who claimed to be selling chocolate for a charitable cause. The transactions were for hundreds of dollars, which the victims didn't see before tapping. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with any scam, vigilance is key. Tap-to-pay is easy enough to feel automatic, and you may be less likely to pause and check the details than you would when swiping or entering your credit card. Always slow down and confirm the merchant name and transaction and tip amount before pulling out your phone or card (again, close proximity is enough to trigger tap-to-pay). Beware of any vendor who tries to rush you, hide the screen, or avoid giving you a receipt. You may also want to set up transaction alerts with your bank or credit card company so you can catch any suspicious charges immediately. If you get a notification about a \"test\" charge, that is also a scam red flag. Finally, while scammers probably aren't going around secretly scanning tap-to-pay en masse, you could protect your cards using a radio frequency identification (RFID)-blocking wallet or sleeve. You can disable NFC on your Android in Settings (type \"NFC\" into the search bar). On iPhone, you have to turn on Airplane Mode to block NFC. \n            ",

But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple Music has been steadily getting useful new features since the release of iOS 26, and the latest changes are especially exciting. Finally, the music streaming service is adding support for offline lyrics, which will officially come in iOS 26.2 when it releases in the next few weeks (although you can try them out now via the iOS 26.2 beta). Meanwhile, in iOS 26.1, users got the ability to swipe on the mini player to go to the next or previous song in their lineup, alongside enhanced AI DJ features and playlist folders for improved music organization. These followed previous additions, such as lyrics translation, a new DJ-like feature called AutoMix, and animated cover art on the lock screen. If that sounds like a lot, I've got you covered. Here are all the new Apple Music features in iOS 26, starting with the most recent.Apple Music lyrics now work offlineWhen I travel, I rarely have access to great connectivity. It always annoys me when Apple Music just stops showing lyrics while I'm offline, which happens whenever I take a flight, or when I'm traveling in the beautiful mountains in my country. Previously, I would download songs from Apple Music to keep me company during these offline periods, but I did miss having access to lyrics. That's about to change with iOS 26.2, which is currently available in beta. Eagle-eyed Reddit users spotted support for offline lyrics in iOS 26.2, so you can expect it to ship to your iPhone soon.Swipe to change songs\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nThis is one of the most exciting additions to Apple Music, and it came in iOS 26.1. When you're listening to music in the app, you can swipe left or right on the mini player to switch to the previous or next song. Previously, you had to expand the mini player to see the previous/next song buttons, but now swapping music is much faster. And even if the player is expanded, you can still swipe on the song's name up top to change the track.\nLyrics Translation for your favorite songsApple Music has had time-synced lyrics for a while now, which works great when you speak the language the song was written in. However, it's not as helpful when you're listening to songs in different languages, and that's where Lyrics Translation comes in. It adds translations below each time-synced lyric line, making it easy to follow a song's meaning, too. I've been seeing translated lyrics for many songs across multiple languages, even when the primary song lyrics are in a non-Roman script.Learn how to pronounce lyrics correctly\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nAnother iOS 26 lyrics upgrade lets Apple Music show you the correct pronunciations for lyrics in foreign languages. Not every song has lyrics in Roman script, so if you can't read the alphabet they're in, this new feature will help you learn how to pronounce those words. It does this by showing you a transliteration from the original script to Roman, which makes it easier to sing along. I've been listening to songs by various Indian musicians, and noticing that Apple Music almost always has transliterations available to help with pronunciation.AutoMix is an AI DJ for your playlistsAutoMix is a new addition to Apple Music's playback controls. You'll see it alongside the Shuffle, Repeat, and Autoplay buttons. When enabled, AutoMix will analyze the audio features of songs and use DJ-like tricks such as time stretching and beat matching to deliver continuous playback. Initially, I did not like AutoMix much because it often made the transitions between songs very jarring. Over time, that has become a lot less noticeable, but I still wouldn't use it with any of my own painstakingly curated playlists, where I've manually matched the sounds at the end of one song with the sounds at the start of the next one. With the release of iOS 26.1, Apple Music has also added AutoMix support over AirPlay. This means that, when using AutoMix while streaming songs from my iPhone to my HomePod mini (or any other AirPlay speaker), the AI DJ will continue to do its thing. Sort playlists into custom folders\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI enjoy Apple Music's editorially curated playlists, but my friends and I have already curated a bunch of playlists for our various moods and occasions. I listen to these frequently, but finding them becomes a bit of a challenge when you've added hundreds of playlists to your account. Thanks to Apple Music's new playlist folders, I've been able to tame this chaos quite easily. Get started by opening the Music app on your iPhone and going to Library > Playlists. Tap the + button in the top-right, and select Create New Folder. The good news is that you're free to create nested folders if you wish, which is perfect for all those obsessed with organization. Pin your favorite playlistsThis is a sweet feature that lets you quickly open your favorite Apple Music playlists. You can press and hold any playlist in the Music app in iOS 26, and pin it to the top of the Library tab. If you've pinned your favorite contacts in Messages, then you'll find music pinning to be a familiar feature. You can pin up to six items at a time in Apple Music, which is ideal for bookmarking your favorites.Animated cover art comes to your lock screenAnimated cover art is one of the more visually appealing features of Apple Music, and now it's coming to your lock screen as well. When you play a song that has animated album art, you can tap the player on the lock screen to see it in a neat full-screen view.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're not happy with having your music on the lock screen alone, you'll enjoy Apple Music's iOS 26 home screen widgets. You can quickly add different sized widgets to any of your iPhone's home screens, and start playing music without even launching the Music app. You can choose widgets that show recently played music, top music in your region, recommendations, or even radio stations. Each home screen widget for Apple Music is available in three sizes, so you can pick one that's best for your current home screen layout.A karaoke feature for Apple TV usersApple Music is also getting a new feature called Sing, which only works if you have an iPhone with iOS 26 and an Apple TV running tvOS 26. With all those requirements in place, you can use your iPhone as a mic and have your voice amplified by Apple Music to have a fun karaoke experience right at home.\n            ",

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Another important—but perhaps more overlooked—element of the productivity process is the assessment, however. Reviewing what you did is just as integral as planning how you’ll do it—in reviewing, you get a chance to plan better (and improve!) for next time, while also carving out space to appreciate what you did well—also a major motivator!What is an after-action review? An after-action review, or AAR, is a way to measure the results of your performance and improve on your processes. It was first introduced by the U.S. Army to give units feedback after they had collective training exercises. The Army has actually released a ton of literature on it, but all you need to know is that when carried out right, it’s standardized, done the same way every time, and useful for building a framework that can enhance future labor. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIf you do end up diving into that mountain of literature on the AAR, you’ll notice that it was designed for units or teams and is typically conducted by a facilitator who encourages members to discuss each part of the effort with the group. But it can be useful for individuals, too, since the process of completing an AAR is standardized and easy to follow. Build time into your schedule to conduct your own personal AAR after completing a major project, whether at work or in your personal life. You can complete it at the end of every week, or once you've finished a specific project. Either way, you'll want to keep notes of these reviews, whether in your planner or in a document you can add to a larger file about the project, like a single source of truth (SSOT). You may feel silly \"reviewing\" work you just completed, but the arguments for it—and the potential benefits—are substantial. First, if you're honest with yourself about what went wrong, you can figure out why the parts that didn't work were inefficient or ineffective, then seek solutions. In identifying what went well, you can set plans to replicate your process in the future, and find a little motivation in a job well done. An AAR (or something similar) is an integral part of many popular productivity techniques, including Getting Things Done and Agile Results. All the planning in the world doesn't matter if you never reflect on how it all went so you can improve next time around. What you should put into your after-action reviewThis is where we get into the rigid, structured process of the Army. There are four questions you’ll ask yourself when conducting your AAR and they’ll always be the same: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat did I intend to accomplish?What did I do?Why did it happen the way it did?What will I do to change my strategy or execution for a better outcome next time OR how can I duplicate my success?Essentially, consider what you wanted to get done, what you actually got done, what impacted the outcome, and what you can take away for future attempts. Even running over this checklist in your head is a good practice, but writing it down is best, so you can refer back to it next time you’re in the planning stages on a new project. For instance, say you want to clean your kitchen. That’s the answer to the first question. What you really did, whether it was clean the kitchen, avoid the task, or only give it a half-effort, is the answer to the second. The third question is where you get introspective: If you did clean the kitchen, was it because you had company coming over and felt a sense of urgency, aligning your productivity with the Yerkes-Dodson Law? Or maybe it was because you needed to feel a sense of accomplishment after an otherwise unproductive week, but you were so burned out that you didn't do a great job. If you didn’t clean, was it because you felt overwhelmed? Did you get too busy? Did you lack the right tools for the job? Once you’ve established your reasons, you can build them into the answer to the fourth question, writing something like, “I will clean my kitchen weekly to make sure I’m always ready for unexpected company,” “I will follow a regimented cleaning method to avoid feeling overwhelmed,” or, “I will invest in better cleaning tools to make the next attempt go smoother.” When cleaning time rolls around again, you’ll pre-plan your actions as normal, scheduling out time for the activity and setting goals. Refer back to your AAR to refresh your memory on what went right and what went wrong the last time you tried to do the task. Eventually, you’ll smooth out the issues that are preventing you from being most efficient and get more results. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. But it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Yes, as part of the November 2025 Pixel feature drop, Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones (excluding the Pixel 9a) are getting AI notification summaries.The problem with AI notification summariesIf you're reeling back after reading that, I don't blame you. This is one of the few AI features Apple beat Google to the punch on, and when they came out during the iOS 18.3 beta, the summaries were quickly criticized for handling hard topics like breakups with a cold tone, as well as for misreporting the news.Apple quickly pulled news summaries (although they've since come back) and made it clearer when an AI was writing a notification, but it seems Google's still being a bit more cautious with its launch.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow AI Notification Summaries on Pixel work\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nRather than trying to organize every notification you might get, Google's AI Summaries are just starting off with popular chat apps for now, including its own Messages app and alternatives like WhatsApp. Additionally, they'll only kick in on \"longer chats,\" with the idea being to give you, \"digestible conversation recaps.\" That means you're going to see far fewer AI notifications than on the iPhone, which currently uses them for news, entertainment, chats, email, and more. That's probably a safer approach for Google, but it does mean the AI summaries are meant to be used more to get you quickly back up to speed, rather than for organization (although that will change in the future).As on the iPhone, AI notification summaries on the Pixel will be indicated by a small icon with a sparkle and a few lines below it, with the summary following. They'll also be italicized for additional visual distinction.How to turn on AI Notification Summaries on PixelGoogle is also exercising caution by making its AI notification summaries entirely opt-in. That means you'll need to manually turn them on before you start seeing them, which you can do under Settings > Notifications > Notification Summaries. While on this page, you'll also be able to exclude certain apps from sending AI notification summaries, by adding them to the \"Don't include these apps\" list.If you're still not seeing the summaries after enabling them, ensure your Android System Intelligence is enabled under Settings > Notifications > Privacy > Notification read, reply & control. Additionally, summaries will not be generated while your phone is in battery saver mode, or while you're actively using it (per Google, for them to kick in, \"the screen must be off for a moment\").When will my Pixel get AI Notification Summaries?AI Notification summaries start rolling out today, alongside the November system patch. However, they're not automatically included in the downloadable patch, so it might be a while before you see them (I don't have them yet).It's still not a bad idea to get your phone fully up-to-date in the meantime. To download the November 2025 Pixel update, either wait for a notification from Google, or head to Settings > System > Software updates to manually check if it's been rolled out to you yet.What's next for Pixel's AI Notification Summaries?While today's update is clearly just Google dipping its toes in the water, the company does have bigger plans for December, where some Pixels will also start automatically silencing \"lower-priority notifications\" and will start automatically sorting them into categories like \"News\" and \"Promotions.\" Hopefully, Google will have learned some lessons from Apple by the time those features go live.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

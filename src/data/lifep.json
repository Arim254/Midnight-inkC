Take a Message is a recently introduced feature for the Phone app that activates when the recipient is not available to answer (or declines the incoming call). The caller hears the following: “The person you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” If you, as the recipient, tap the Take a message notification on your device, you can see a transcript of the audio in real time and hit Answer if you want to pick up. (Take a Message will also detect spam calls and mark them with a warning.)A few users have reported that Take a Message has activated and allowed the caller to hear the recipient's background audio as they are leaving a message. It's important to note that this is not a widespread issue, and most of the reports come from people with older Pixel devices that no longer get OS updates. According to 9to5Google, Google is investigating the reports. \nAgain, while this doesn't seem to be a bug affecting most Pixel users, you can disable Take a Message if you are concerned about privacy, especially with unknown callers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to disable Take a Message on your PixelOpen the Phone app on your device and tap the icon in the top-left corner to open Settings.

Mail and AOL Mail, are not responding.\n                                            Downdetector shows almost 9,000 user reports as of 9:50 a.m. ET.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Your eyes don't deceive you: You did just read a headline in the year of our lord 2026 about Yahoo! Despite losing out to other search engine and email companies like Google, Yahoo! is very much still a thing. In fact, one statistic claims Yahoo! Mail still has 225 million daily active users to this day. That's a ways off from Gmail's 1.8 billion daily active users, but way better than AOL's eight million users. (Yes, AOL is still a thing, and is actually a part of Yahoo!—at least until its sale to Bending Spoons goes through).But I'm not here to talk about Yahoo! and AOL's marketshare. Instead, I'm here to sound the alarms to the millions of people that use Yahoo!, and, by extension, AOL: The services were down this morning. If you tried to search the web for something on Yahoo!, or check your Yahoo! Mail, or even your AOL Mail, you'd find the following error message: \"Edge: Too Many Requests.\" I first spotted the outage via Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which had tens of thousands of user reports, before falling off by 10:30 a.m. ET. Since then, the sites are back online.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's no official reason for the outage from Yahoo! as of this article, but, like most of these outages, the company resolved the issues fairly quickly. Last week, X had an outage, and it came back online before long. Of course, that outage was overshadowed by the massive Verizon outage, which Verizon claimed was simply a \"software issue.\" There's a big difference between a series of web sites going down and a nationwide cell network, however, so it's not surprising Yahoo! and AOL alike were both back online this morning. The millions of users who rely on these services now have them back, while the rest of us can forget about them all over again.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to subscribe to Full Self-Driving instead.Before, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).Now, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.Which features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.At any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Personally, I'd rather risk frostbite over any treadmill run that lasts longer than 20 minutes. But is there a point where winter runs cross over from difficult to dangerous? There is no clear cut-offMost experts suggest that the danger zone begins around -18°F (-28° Celcius), particularly when factoring in wind chill. At these extreme temperatures, the risk of frostbite increases dramatically, and breathing frigid air can become uncomfortable or even harmful to your lungs and airways.But beyond the raw temperature, certain conditions should prompt you to choose the treadmill over the trail. Wind chill matters significantly more than the actual temperature—a 20°F day with 25 mph winds feels like -4°F and carries similar risks. Precipitation combined with cold is particularly dangerous, as wet clothing rapidly accelerates heat loss.\nIcy conditions create obvious fall risks, and a twisted ankle or other injury becomes far more serious when you're miles from home in subzero temperatures. If the footing is treacherous with ice or you're unable to adequately protect your extremities with the gear you have available, it's wise to skip the outdoor run. Trust your instincts: If the cold feels genuinely painful within the first few minutes rather than just uncomfortable, that's your body sending a clear message.Again, this threshold isn't absolute. Your personal cold tolerance, experience level, the gear you own, and specific weather conditions all play a role. I know I've managed runs in 10°F, mostly because it was plenty sunny, with no wind, and I was expertly bundled up. Here are some of things to do if you’re a brave soul heading out to run in the freezing cold.If you do venture out in very cold weather, preparation is everything. Dress in layers using moisture-wicking base layers, insulating middle layers, and windproof outer shells. Protect your extremities carefully with gloves or mittens, a hat or headband, and warm socks. A neck gaiter is a must-have to pull up over your nose and mouth to help warm the air before it reaches the lungs.Start your run into the wind so you'll have it at your back when you're sweaty and more vulnerable to heat loss on the return trip. Keep your runs shorter and stay close to home or in areas with bailout options. Let someone know your route and expected return time. It also helps to physically modify your route to accommodate layers. Plan a run where you can shed extra layers after the first mile and then pick them up on your way back.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPay attention to your body throughout the run. Any numbness, excessive pain, confusion, or severe shivering means it's time to get indoors immediately. Remember that you can always cut a run short—there's no shame in prioritizing your safety over a workout.Another tip, from plenty of personal experience: Be extra aware of mouth-breathing while running in cold, dry air. I recommend running with cough drops in order to help you practice breathing through your nose.The bottom lineI always tell myself that if something feels off after my first mile, I’m allowed to turn around and walk home. Grant yourself extra leniency in extreme weather conditions. If you really can’t bear missing any miles, consider a hybrid plan of running half of your route outdoors and half on a treadmill.You can run outside at quite chilly temperatures before you seriously risk frostbite or any other cold-weather consequences. For most runners, the practical limit for safe outdoor running falls somewhere between 0 and -20°F. As long as you’re prepared with protective gear, you can listen to your body to acclimate to cold temperatures as best as you personally can. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

JustTheBrowser is a free and open source tool from developer and tech blogger Corbin Davenport that removes AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Basically, you can run this once and never think about these features again.To get started, head to the JustTheBrowser homepage. There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.Either way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing. On macOS, I needed to follow a few instructions to enable a configuration policy in the Settings app, something that only took a couple of clicks. After that, Chrome was free of any and all references to AI.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nA number of other features were also gone, including those annoying prompts to switch my default browser.The way this works is kind of interesting: it uses features intended for large organizations. Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.It's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Microsoft's flagship work suite, which includes tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook, is currently experiencing issues impacting users. It's not yet clear exactly why these problems are occurring, but according to Downdetector (owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis) thousands of users are reporting issues.There are any number of causes that could trigger a widespread outage like this, and in all likelihood, Microsoft will have the issue isolated and fixed soon—especially considering how many companies and users rely on Microsoft 365 to function. But it does follow a number of high-profile outages this week. Yesterday, Yahoo! and AOL were both down. Last week, X experienced an outage, as did Verizon—quite famously, I might add. And this morning, Instagram was also down.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut joining that list as well is none other than Microsoft itself. These services were all down yesterday, too, making this the second day in a row. Again, it's not clear why Microsoft is experiencing these issues, but while we wait for a fix, there's not much you can do on your end. If your Microsoft apps are acting up, you can try to work with any of the offline tools you have access to. If you have other means of communication other than Teams, run with that. There's nothing short of Microsoft issuing a patch on its end that will bring back online functionality here.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:Remove AI from results\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.Return Google search to 10 blue linksGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search. \nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.Search a particular domainIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.Restrict results to one websiteIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.Look for specific file formatsWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.Google has easily accessible filters If you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse Google's Advanced Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.Try reverse image searchGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.Use content blockers to hide unwanted resultsIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.Set your favorite websites as preferred sourcesIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites. If you'd like, you can click this link to add Lifehacker as a preferred source.\n            ",

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing. The issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.  But Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention. No Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app. \nNetflix's take on TikTok The company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.  Unlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok? As Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria. Catering to the short attention spanI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.Verizon credit phishing scamAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website. If you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it. \nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Discovery, it seems the company is actually adding new features to its subscription service. Netflix is always adding new shows and movies, which is what most users are looking for in the platform, but that's not all you can expect from your account. In fact, Netflix is now rolling out an interactive experience for its live competition shows, allowing subscribers to cast votes in real-time. Live voting comes to Star SearchNetflix announced the change in a press release on Tuesday, and also revealed the first show to officially run with real-time voting: Star Search. Netflix is bringing back the American Idol precursor tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT), and will allow viewers to choose which contestant they like best alongside \"millions of others.\"  Netflix says it first tested the feature with the show Dinner Time Live with David Chang, and \"learned firsthand how members appreciated the seamless and integrated ways they could participate in the series.\" I don't think you need a focus group to know that people like sharing their opinions on things, but then, I'm not a Netflix exec. \nThe company clarified in its press release that only live events will work with real-time voting. If you watch a show after it airs, you won't be able to cast your vote—which, obviously, makes sense. The show doesn't really need to know who you'd pick as a winner after the winner has already been chosen—though Netflix could always use the extra user data, I'm sure. Star Search is the only show at this time that supports this feature, but Netflix says more real-time voting shows are on the way.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to vote in live Netflix events\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Netflix\n                    \n    \nNetflix says that when you watch a live event, you'll be able to vote when watching on TV or a streaming device. You won't be able to vote if you're watching in a web browser, nor will you be able to vote if you rewind, pause, or tune-in late. When you join a live program, make sure you do so on a smart TV, supported streaming device (such as Apple TV, Fire TV, or Roku), or the Netflix mobile app. If you want to watch in a web browser, you can still vote on your phone at the same time. Netflix will prompt you when it's time to vote. You'll see a 1–5 star rating appear on the screen. Click on tap on the star level you want for each performer. Note that each profile only has one chance to vote per performance, so you can't issue another vote after you cast one—you'll just need to wait until the next performance. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.How age prediction for ChatGPT worksOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.Here's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\nWhat's restricted in the \"safer\" version of ChatGPTThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:Graphic violence or goreViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"Role play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in natureSelf-harm descriptionsContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming The company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.AI isn't always great at age predictionThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.That doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.I don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The entire ecosystem seemingly exists to manipulate you, which can make finding clarity hard. I've written about how to avoid anxiety bait, which can be an important step toward healthy and productive engagement, but an important step is recognizing when you're being manipulated. RageCheck is a potentially useful tool here.Built using concepts from social science research, this website can analyze any link or screenshot. It points out examples of potentially manipulative language, from us-versus-them framing to emotionally loaded phrasing. \"The system analyzes text for linguistic patterns commonly associated with manipulative framing—language optimized to provoke high-arousal reactions over understanding,\" says the methodology page. \"It does not assess factual accuracy or political bias.\"Using the site is simple: just paste a link to an article and hit Enter. After a few moments, you'll see a statistical breakdown of the potentially manipulative language in the piece across five categories—emotional heat, us versus them, moral outrage, black-and-white thinking, and fight picking. The article is excerpted below, with examples of these tactics highlighted. In the left panel you'll see a \"Bait Score,\" which is an attempt to calculate how manipulative the article is being. Below that, you'll see a list of the potentially manipulative techniques employed in the article.\nNone of this is intended to be used as an alternative to fact checking or serve as some kind of truth-detecting machine. \"A high score means content uses manipulative framing—it doesn't mean the underlying claims are false,\" says the about page. \"Conversely, a low score doesn't mean content is true.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's worth pointing out that the techniques this tool detects also aren't necessarily bad. Some news stories really should inspire moral outrage, especially in the context of an opinion piece or editorial. Regardless, there's still value in identifying those techniques.Basically, this is a tool that can help you think critically about the media you're consuming, not do that critical thinking for you. Use it if you want to learn a little bit about the kinds of rhetorical tricks you might be vulnerable to.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That was due to Verizon's nationwide outage, which affected roughly two million customers across the United States. If you were among them, you couldn't use your phone on the go, which is sort of the idea behind cellphones in general. This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send work emails or messages, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or perhaps because of it), the company seems keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced it had resolved the outage, it also said it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowVerizon made a post on X, once again apologizing for the outage and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive.

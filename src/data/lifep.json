As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You need a plan. You need acronyms. One such acronym is RAFT, which will literally keep you afloat in the sea of emails you receive every day. You can combine it with others, like LIFO and 4D to maximize its benefits, but first you need to know what to do with it on its own.What is RAFT email management?RAFT stands for the following: ReadActFileTrash.Easy! With this management system, you take the time to read an email first, then act on it however you need to—if you need to, that is—before either filing it away somewhere or deleting it. That’s basically all there is to it, but it works because it requires you to focus on each individual email and make an assessment right away, so you don’t miss anything.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nLike the one- and two-touch rules, this one does require you to open your emails as they come in. For me, that's the hardest part because it's a habit you need to build. This approach reminds me of a more broadly-applicable productivity technique I use often, which is the two-minute rule. When you think of something or are prompted to deal with it, handle it right away. Again, it's a habit that needs to be built up, but I like this approach for all kinds of productivity needs—and with RAFT, you have a clearly outlined series of next steps after you open it up. How to get the most out of RAFTTo maximize the benefits, you should combine this with another system or two. For instance, combine RAFT with the LIFO—last in, first out—method, which calls for you to answer your most recent emails before older ones. If you do this, you’ll always be acting on the most urgent needs instead of playing endless catch-up with things that you let slip by. If something from the past is truly important, you’ll get a follow-up email and you can RAFT then. Otherwise, stick with your most pressing, recent messages and read them, act on them, and file or trash them after that.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes to the acting part, you can call on the trusty 4D method to help you out. The four Ds are delete, do, delegate, or defer, and they refer to the four things you can do with any email. (Delete here is redundant, since “trash” is part of RAFT, but it’s good to reinforce the notion that useless emails should be nuked.) Either do what the email says or delegate it to someone who can, but keep the process moving swiftly. If you don’t end up forwarding it to someone else, delete it or defer (file) it. The main rule of RAFT is you have to do something with every message, not ignore it. As for the filing component of RAFT, make sure you have a great file system in place in advance. If you use Gmail, consider using labels as a more organized archive system, to make whatever you choose to file away more easily accessible. You can label these mini-archives by date, by project, or by whatever makes sense for your retrieval, but be consistent about it so you’re not just banishing all your dealt-with messages to an email limbo. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices. The campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms. How attackers are using ChatGPT Kaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas. However, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.A further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem. Don't trust every command AI generatesIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past. Of course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The deal includes the new console with the new Mario Kart for the same price as the standalone console. You can get this one for $449 (down from $499)—the lowest price it has reached yet, according to price-tracking tools. (Note that you can only see the price once you've signed in and it's in your cart, as Nintendo restricts retailers from promoting anything below the \"minimum advertised price\" of $499.) To top it off, Best Buy is somehow promising to have it delivered to your home by 9 p.m. tonight, Dec. 24—a true Christmas miracle. Not all locations will be available, so make sure you see the \"shipping get it by 9 p.m. today\" note above \"add to cart.\" You can also pick it up within an hour if time is of the essence.\nThis bundle deal is great, and likely the best one you'll see for quite some time, judging by Nintendo's previous deals. To put it into perspective, the OLED edition of the original Nintendo Switch is $400 right now, meaning you can get the new Switch 2 with Mario Kart for $50 more. The new console is also an upgrade in every way, according to Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt's Nintendo Switch 2 review. The ergonomics and design have improved, making it much better to hold and look at. The battery life has also improved, now with about 180 minutes of handheld playtime before the juice runs out.A big plus is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, meaning you can play your old Switch games on it. Some Switch games have the ability to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition by buying that game's upgrade pack. This is especially worth it for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which will look better on the Switch 2.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere aren't a lot of Switch 2 games out at the moment, but there are some classic Nintendo games to keep you busy until the library expands, like Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's actually a time-consuming hobby—but I stumbled across a feature the other day that has made creating spin playlists and soundtracking Q1 of 2026 easier than ever. The best way I can describe the feature I stumbled upon is that it's like Tinder for songs. If you're listening to a song within the app, scroll down. Go past the buttons for Play and Next, past the About the artist section, past the lyrics, and stop when you see Explore [artist name]. Then, you'll have three options like Similar to [artist name] and Similar to [song name], but these can differ slightly. Tapping one of those opens up the new feature. Say you choose Similar to [song name]. You'll be given 30 seconds of a song that Spotify's algorithm considers \"similar\" to the one you were just listening to, plus the artist's name, how many Spotify followers they have, and a three-dot menu that will let you add the song to your likes, add it to a playlist, go to the artist's page, and more. If you like the 30-second clip, you can add the song to your playlists. If not, you can keep swiping downward to hear a new one. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSee how it's like Tinder? You make fairly snap decisions based on the quick preview and few details you get, then swipe away if you don't like it. I found a community forum post on Spotify's website about it, but otherwise, not much chatter. All I can tell is that it's been out since about May. Why I like the featureI prefer this to the other music-discovery options on Spotify because it gives you a quick preview of the song and makes the finding process simple. I am, of course, a big fan of the pre-generated Discover Weekly playlist or New Releases playlist Spotify makes for me every week, but it's time-consuming to listen to all the songs in them and it's not intuitive to find other new songs based on the finite playlists themselves. The 30-second quick hits and easy, swipeable dismissal of the new feature help me figure out if a song is worth my time, either for spin class or personal use, add it to the appropriate playlist if so, and keep moving. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat I especially like is the three hashtags under the artist's name. They are genre descriptions that match up with whatever song you're previewing and I've found them helpful because I have a hard time describing what kind of music I even like. Apparently, per the new feature, I like something called \"speed garage.\" Tapping the #speedgarage hashtag that appears in the song previews brings me to another scrollable preview pane full of, exclusively, more speed garage—whatever that actually is. I still can't define it, but I learned I like it, and that alone is more beneficial than a year's worth of Discover Weekly playlists. I used this feature during my Uber ride to the airport the other day and, by the time I was through TSA, I had 29 new songs in my Q1 playlist. I listened to them on the plane, weeded out ones that didn't match the quarterly vibe well enough, then sent it to my friends, who all gave the collection rave reviews like, and I quote, \"this slaps.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        The holidays are for rest, relaxation, and eating your weight in cookies shaped like reindeer. Your fitness goals can absolutely wait until the new year. But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.These are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed. Tactical door-closed push-ups (10-15 reps)These are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.Spite squats (20 reps)Do some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking. Frustration lunges (10 per leg)Lunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes! \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.Diplomatic plank hold (30-60 seconds)Hold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPassive-aggressive mountain climbers (30 seconds)Quick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor. Peacekeeper glute bridges (15-20 reps)Lie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.Zen bicycle crunches (20 total)Finish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center. Cool downSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.\n            ",

They're different enough that there's certainly one out there that matches or comes close to matching your exact needs, but they do all have one thing in common: They rely on the chronology of when each email came in. Let’s try turning that approach on its head, and instead, sort by sender to weed through the mess.Why you should sort your inbox by senderWhen purging your messages, you probably have an organizational system you follow, like the 4Ds. You go through and decide what gets deleted, done, delegated, or deferred—but there’s not much pattern recognition if you’re just starting at the top and working your way down. Every day's demands or outreach might look different depending on what you have going on at that time. Sorting your inbox by sender instead of most recent helps you see whose (or what) messages you receive most. If it’s a newsletter or mailing list, you can delete them all in one go, but if it’s a specific person at work, you might get a signal that they tend to need a response from you. From there, you can prioritize their emails, maybe adding them as a favorite contact or paying special attention for new correspondence from them, since you know their messages are more consequential than others. Even if you're using the one- or two-touch methods, which call on you to open every single email the moment you get it, this can be helpful because you'll feel a sense of urgency around specific senders once you identify the patterns. So instead of deleting or delegating emails one by one, you can try nuking or dealing with entire batches from certain senders to make the sorting process faster. How to sort by sender in GmailIn Gmail, if you’ve already found a message from the person or entity whose emails you want to bundle up, you can right-click it from your inbox and hit “find emails from.” This brings you to an inbox only of messages from that sender. You can also access this inbox by typing “from:[their email address]” in the search bar, or clicking the advanced search button  and entering their name into the “from” field.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, you can’t sort your entire Gmail inbox by sender, and instead can only make bundles sender by sender, but it still helps with batching them up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sort by sender in OutlookOutlook is better than Gmail for this method. In fact, it allows you to sort your entire inbox not only by sender, but by other recipients, size, and more.At the top of the inbox, hit “Filter,” then “Sort by.” Depending on what version you’re running, you may have to go into the “View” tab and hit “From” in the Arrangement group. The emails will line up in your inbox by sender, making them easy to bundle and delete.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network. As GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution. Check your IP address for suspicious activityTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure). \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps. As BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.  One of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live. What can you do with Apple Music in ChatGPT?First of all, you don't actually need to subscribe to connect Apple Music to ChatGPT. It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"Once you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT. What are the privacy implications of connecting Apple Music to ChatGPT?Love it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.    \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)  One benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself. I personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.  If you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"\n            \n    ",

Who would actually befriend an AI bot, let alone fall in love with them? Fast forward 12 years, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only do people love chatting with AI bots, they are actually developing deep connections with them. I still don't get it, but I can't deny it: People like these chatbots a lot.Part of what people like about conversations with generative AI is the \"personality\" of each bot—or, at least, its perceived personality. After all, ChatGPT isn't a monolith: You can adjust the bot to sound wildly different than it does on someone else's app, which raises some questions for me regarding these curated companions. But I digress: This article isn't necessarily a critique of how people are attaching themselves to ChatGPT; rather, I'm sharing the news that OpenAI is now giving you more control over how the bot sounds and responds in your conversations. Curate your perfect AI companion On Friday, OpenAI announced new controls for ChaGPT's \"Personalization.\" In a post on X, the company revealed that users can now adjust their chatbot's \"characteristics,\" or, in other words, its overall personality. These are adjustments to the personality types that OpenAI has already let you choose from, which include one of eight options: \"Default\" (preset style and tone); \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Friendly\" (warm and chatty); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative); \"Efficient\" (concise and plain); \"Nerdy\" (exploratory and enthusiastic); and \"Cynical\" (critical and sarcastic).  \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nBut no matter which of these personalities you pick, you now have four \"characteristics\" to adjust to fine-tune the overall experience. There's \"Warm,\" \"Enthusiastic,\" \"Headers & Lists,\" and \"Emoji,\" with the option to have more or less of each, or the default amount, as OpenAI sees fit. For Warm, you can either have ChatGPT be friendlier and more personable, or more professional and factual. With Enthusiastic, you can choose the bot to have more energy and excitement, or be calmer and more neutral. \"Headers & Lists\" lets you choose between clear formatting and lists, or more paragraphs. And, of course, you can control whether ChatGPT uses more emoji, or fewer, depending on your sense of fun and joy. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs usual, you can take advantage of custom instructions to guide ChatGPT's personality in a direction you like, especially when the presets don't give you those options. For example, if you'd like ChatGPT to talk to you like a pirate, or if you want it to end every response with a certain catchphrase, here's your chance to influence the bot. I'm really not someone who uses ChatGPT outside of testing it for coverage, so I can't speak to whether these additional controls are useful. But if you want to try making your version of ChatGPT your ideal \"AI companion,\" the controls are at your disposal. You'll find these options wherever you access ChatGPT. You can either access it from Settings > Personalization, or from the Personalization shortcut in the ChatGPT menu.  \n            \n    ",

As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.  Lookalike domains contain malicious contentThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes. In some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware. Infoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to avoid parked domain scamsOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site. I've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.If AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good. Then, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)How to AirDrop with strangers using AirDrop codesHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction. As stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed. \n            \n    ",

These horrors will visit you at all hours of the day, making it harder to spot the truly important messages in your inbox—and it gets worse once you've gotten fed up enough to disable push notifications and they start to really pile up. It’s time to banish these buggers. And, if you're using Gmail, there’s an easy way to do it.Use filters to manage mailing list emails in GmailYou can use a third-party add-on to go through your mailing lists and unsubscribe, saying goodbye to newsletters and e-blasts. But you know what’s easier and less expensive? Setting a filter in Gmail. Open up one of your mailing list emails and click the three dots in the menu bar. You’ll see “Mark as unread,” “Mark as important,” and a few other options, but the one you want is “Filter messages like these.”\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Gmail\n                    \n    \nFrom there, you’ll see a dialog box asking how you want to filter your messages. You can filter by sender, recipients, and subjects, but also by anything that “has the words…” In the “has the words” row, type “unsubscribe.” \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, any email containing the word “unsubscribe”—which reputable email blasts almost always do—can be filtered out of your inbox without you having to do anything. Once you type “unsubscribe” there, hit the “create filter” button. The following dialog box will ask how you want these filtered. You can choose to have them archived, marked as read, starred, forwarded, or immediately deleted.Things to consider when creating Gmail filtersI recommend archiving over deleting in case you ever want to find them again, but if you are sure you’ll never want to open another mailing list, newsletter, or sales blast, feel free to check the box next to “delete.” Note that if you choose to archive but later want to delete them, you’ll have to do so manually. Personally, I am happy to pay for extra Google storage to keep a record of messages instead of inadvertently lose something I need, but I know that's needlessly neurotic. If you do end up archiving those, the next step needs to be actually unsubscribing from the messages you truly don't want to receive. Gmail has recently made this a lot easier: You can usually click an unsubscribe button up at the top of the offending email. The Google-run email service also rolled out a Manage Subscriptions service this past summer, so once you take a gander at the archive full of junk and notice what you're not exactly needing or opening up, you can head over there and nuke your subscriptions quickly and easily. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

ANC has a time and a place, but being able to be aware of my surroundings and have conversations with my wife while working from home has made 2025 more enjoyable. I owe that to the Shokz Open Run Pro 2, which are bone conduction headphones that leave your ears uncovered. But if you prefer true wireless earbuds that have the same benefit, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are a great alternative, and right now, they're on sale for $139.95 (originally $199.95).\nUnlike the Shokz Open Run Pro 2, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are not bone conduction headphones; instead, the sound is projected toward your ears (think of it like small speakers next to your ears). This means, like bone conduction headphones, your ears are not plugged by any earbuds. They simply rest on them, allowing you to use your ears to their full potential. The OpenFit 2+ comes with some cool features. They have Dolby cinematic sound, which is an immersive sound feature that frees sound channels, making directional sound clearer (almost like surround sound). If you like to watch movies or shows with your earbuds, this is a huge plus. The design fits snug on your ears, so you don't have to worry about them falling off, regardless of how intense your workouts get. The Shokz companion app is excellent, and gives you a lot of freedom with the EQ, so you can tweak the settings to optimize podcasts or a bass-heavy format when you need that extra motivation in the gym. You can expect about 11 hours of battery life with another 48 hours from the charging case. You can also charge them wirelessly through the case.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're looking to disconnect from ANC headphones in 2026, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are a great option with this 30% discount.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "The cloud has closed on the Neato D5, but there's hope with a little DIY.\n                                                    Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                            \n        \n        My Neato D5 Connected was once a willing workhorse, but, today, things aren't looking so good. I recently caught an email from the company alerting me that it shut down my vacuum's cloud servers. Now, my once capable Neato is just a LiDAR-equipped vacuum with a soul that's been deprecated. Without cloud servers, the \"smart\" is gone.This could be the lobotomized future awaiting Roomba users. Earlier this month, the company behind the pioneering smart vacuum, iRobot, filed for bankruptcy. The remainder of the business will go to its primary manufacturing partner—the one it owes all that money to—Shenzhen Picea Robotics. It's a stark reminder that the longevity of a connected smart device depends entirely on the financial health of the company that made it. I'm not giving up, however. I'm now attempting to get the Neato D5 back into business. Whether you have a Neato, a Roomba, or another robot vacuum approaching the end of its connected, you can mirror my steps to keep your device cleaning. Switch your robot vacuum to manual\n    \n            \n            The email that Neato sent out during Thanksgiving week letting me know my robot vacuum was done for. \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFollowing the above email, I tried earnestly to get the Neato back online and back into a routine. I ended up reviving my original account by some miracle, though I have absolutely no access to the vacuum via the app as it currently is.Luckily, there is already a community of folks working to restore the cloud service that once enabled Neato's robot vacuums to schedule themselves. Neato-connected lets you use Home Assistant to manage the brand's devices without the cloud. This is the best choice for experts if the goal is to revive the robot vacuum to its full capacities. Neato has already said that the robots will continue to work manually. The D5 has LiDAR, so it can still physically \"see\" its way around a floor plan. And although you can't schedule the device or remotely control it, you can still get up and push a button to start a cleaning session. If you want to be super extra, Switchbot makes an affordable button-pushing gadget you can install near the vacuum dock to trigger it from your phone, essentially \"hacking\" a remote start.The other headache of trying to keep old hardware from going extinct is figuring out if its parts and mechanics still work. My Neato D5, for example, still hasn't successfully managed a manual cleaning session. After some troubleshooting, which involved several factory resets, disconnecting and reconnecting the battery, and cleaning debris from all the sensors, it turns out that one of the LiDAR turrets—the hat on top—needs a fix. The vacuum won't start until that's addressed, since it literally can't navigate without that system spinning at a precise speed.The Neato D5 is going to require some surgery. I am either going to fix it by stabilizing a band, or buy a replacement part from eBay and have someone more tech-savvy help with the install. There's always the option to donate it to a better cause, too. Rather than hold on to an eight pound paperweight rotting away in the utility closet, it can get a second life with a local robotics group, since Neato vacuums have a reputation for being highly scrappable due to their laser sensors.\n    \n            \n            Until I get the Neato D5 serviced, it will not manually clean. \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEven cheaper robot vacuums, like an Ecovacs, can find a second life this way. While they aren't as easily \"hackable\" as Neato (or a Roomba), there are plenty of high school robotics teams that can disassemble the devices to retrieve motors and wheels.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nNever throw a robot vacuum into the trash. If the device is truly dead and unusable for parts, look into responsibly recycling the Lithium-ion battery as well as the plastic and metal shell with an e-waste recycler.  Preparing for the end of RoombaIf you own a Roomba, you aren't offline yet. iRobot is currently undergoing a restructuring, and the company has stated that app functionality and firmware updates will continue as usual. But inevitable change is coming if Neato's trajectory is any indication. We don't know exactly how Roomba's business will go now that it has changed ownership. Existing Roombas rely on the cloud for much of their flagship functionality, like Smart Maps, which help with specific room targeting. Losing the ability would be a major blow to the hardware's legacy.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou should prepare for what's to come, even if it involves a little over-preparing. Stockpile replacement parts now, while they're still available. Although Roomba's manufacturer has taken over the business, older models will fall by the wayside as a new generation of robot vacuums is introduced. If you want to get a few more lives out of your Roomba, buy at least a two-year supply of authentic, first-party brushes, rollers, and HEPA filters. Skip the third-party stuff.You'll also want to invest in Roomba's dual-mode virtual wall barriers. Buy them used on eBay. These will come in handy if Roomba's servers ever go offline, since they act as infrared lighthouses to help direct the Roomba's path. You'll be able to use these with Roomba's \"Clean\" button, its manual mode that doesn't require the internet to start. You'll also want to look into downloading your Smart Maps, in case you can integrate them later. If that isn't enough for you, there is a vibrant community of tinkerers who have long been dedicated to liberating Roombas from the clutches of the cloud. Projects like rest980 and dorita980 let tech-savvy users host their own local control servers, though this often involves a third-party device such as a Home Assistant hub.Ending the e-waste cycleHistory tends to repeat itself in the gadget world. You can at least future-proof your buying decision by recognizing that obsolescence is a possibility down the line. This applies to any connected gadget, from big-name brands to small ones.Matter, the smart home specification that's been quietly rolling out over the past few years, will be more helpful for aging smart gadgets like this, especially since its latest release. It now enables local smart-home control for robot vacuums, so you don't need a cloud service to connect. The vacuum talks directly to your phone or smart hub instead. There are also brands like Roborock that advertise that their robot vacuums have local-only modes. You can even install another community-managed project, Valetudo, on those brands and go completely corporate-free. Or, you could go offline. Most connected home gadgets have variants that use a physical remote control instead. Eufy still makes versions of its robot vacuums without wifi, with no cloud features to worry about going extinct.I'm waiting before I buy eBay parts for the Neato D5 Connected. I need to see if I can fix what's broken with some finagling. It's a bummer I didn't think of preparing for the end of the device's life earlier—like when Neato's parent company announced its eventual shutdown two years ago—to give it a second life and save it from abject hardware failure. If all else fails, I can find it a good home with a robotics team or educational program that can put its parts to good use. I will have considered that a well-lived life for a connected gadget.\n            ",

You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts. If you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)To pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning. \nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app: Gesture navigation: Swipe up and hold2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + OverviewNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons. The new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCurrently, there's a waitlist to sign up for ChatGPT Health, and over time it will roll out to all users. At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.When it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Soundcore\n                    \n    \nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Google is adding a slate of AI features to Gmail that could save some of the hassle of searching for important information buried in messages and threads. Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies. See personalized, AI-powered snapshots Gmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.AI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\" \nGet AI Overviews via Gmail searchGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI will proofread your emailsFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise. Like AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models. \n            ",

Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that. WheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel. When I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment. \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Iyaz Akhtar\n                    \n    \nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The third (and newest) generation comes with OTA updates that the AirPods Pro 2 also get to enjoy—but considering the second and third generations are the same price right now, why not go with the newer version? The AirPods Pro 3 are down to $199 (originally $249.99), which they briefly hit back in December during the holiday sales—the lowest price yet, according to price tracking tools.\nThe AirPods Pro 3 improve on already great premium earbuds with new features (like a heart rate sensor) without increasing the list price. You'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" (this also works for answering or denying calls). Apple added a live translation feature to both the second- and third-generation AirPods Pro when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year. You'll also get features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSince these are in-ear earbuds (as supposed to regular earbuds like the AirPods 4) the ANC is much better since it naturally blocks out the noise with a tight seal, but the ANC technology itself has also improved—as has the sound quality, thanks to the new H3 chip, as PCMag detailed in its \"exemplary\" review, calling them the best earbuds your money can buy. You can expect about eight hours of juice, depending on your usage, and another 24 hours from the charging case. \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026. While the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.How Ford AI Assistant worksFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time. \nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.   \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWill Ford AI Assistant actually be useful?As someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.Of course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.  \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Because they come with batteries and chargers, they’re a great way to get everything you need to use a new tool set right away, and they can be more economical than buying each tool individually. Milwaukee tool sets are often more than $1,000, but you can get a few of these bundles for under $700 right now at Home Depot.Why I recommend Milwaukee toolsI’ve been using Milwaukee cordless tools for over a decade on a variety of professional and personal projects, including projects around the house as well as large scale decking installations. These tools tend to be reliable and the batteries routinely last more than ten years, even working on outdoor projects, exposed to rain and dirt. Durability is a big consideration when I buy tools; the longer they last, the more economical they are. Because all of the current tools are backwards-compatible with all of the 18-volt batteries I have, it's easy to add tools to my set as new ones come out that I want to try, and as my needs expand. Milwaukee tool bundles on saleThe Milwaukee 18-volt, nine-tool combo kit is on sale for $649, 46% off its regular price. It comes with a drill, a ¼-inch impact driver, a ½-inch impact wrench, a 6 ½-inch circular saw, a one-hand reciprocating saw, an angle grinder, an oscillating multitool, a mini blower, a work light, two 5-amp-hour batteries, a charger, and tool bag. This is a good set for larger projects, and it has many of the tools included that I used for building a large outdoor deck. Two larger capacity batteries is a good place to start, although if you plan on using multiple saw simultaneously, you’ll need to add another battery or two to keep a fresh battery ready on the charger.\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \nThe Milwaukee 18-volt five-tool combo kit is on sale for $299, 50% off its regular price. This set includes a drill, a ¼-inch impact driver, a 6 ½-inch circular saw, a one-hand reciprocating saw, a work light, a five-amp-hour battery, a 1.5-amp-hour battery, a charger, and a tool bag. This set has everything you need to get started doing DIY projects, and it includes all the basic Milwaukee tools I use day-to-day for woodworking and smaller building projects like building shelves. This is a good starter set to build on, and it's very similar to the one I began with more than a decade ago.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Milwaukee 12-volt sub-compact drill and driver set is on sale for $199, 50% off its regular price. This set includes a 12-volt drill, an impact driver, a powered ratchet, two batteries, a charger, and a tool bag. While 12-volt batteries are often underpowered for larger projects, these smaller tools can be quite useful for projects like furniture assembly, putting up shelves, or doing appliance repair, as you often don’t need more than an hour or so of battery life to accomplish many of these tasks with your tools, and the smaller size makes them easier to fit into tight spaces.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

At CES 2026, the company announced a new line of unobtrusive smart TVs, complete with a new brand name and a redesigned FireTV OS, which will also show up on other FireTV devices.Meet the Ember Artline TV series\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Amazon\n                    \n    \nAmazon is calling its new line of art TVs \"Ember Artline.\" They will ship in two sizes, 55 inches and 65 inches, with pricing starting at $899 for the base model—some $200 cheaper than the list price of Samsung's Frame TVs (though those models are regularly discounted on Amazon).The panels will offer 4K QLED screens with 450 nits of brightness. Because it's an art TV, there is a matte screen coating to reduce glare and make it look less like a standard TV. They also feature Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6. Design-wise, they're incredibly thin, around 1.5 inches thick.\nAmazon's big selling point here is the Ember Artline offers 10 different frame options, all of which snap on the TV with magnets. You can choose between textures and colors like Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver. In its art mode, the sets will cycle between 2,000 images of artworks, or your personal selection of photos. \"Omnisense technology\" will allow the display to turn on when anyone walks in the room, and turns off when they walk out, saving energy.And of course, this wouldn't be a CES 2026 product announcement without a bit of AI. Amazon is integrating Alexa+ into the FireTV OS on these sets, including an AI feature that will show art pieces on TV that match the decor and room that you're in (after you upload four photos taken from different angles). With an Amazon Photos connection, you can also ask Alexa+ to create slideshows from specific vacations, days, or events. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe Ember Artline lineup will start shipping sometime in spring, starting in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the U.K.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's also a redesigned FireTV interface\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Amazon\n                    \n    \nAlong with the new art TVs, Amazon also showed off a redesigned FireTV interface—and it looks quite a bit like Google TV. That's not a bad thing from my point-of-view; one of my biggest issues with the FireTV OS is its slow and inconsistent home page. A refresh with better organization will certainly help, and visually, it looks a lot cleaner, with rounded corners, consistent typography, and much better spacing between elements. The home screen now has tabs above to quickly switch to movies, TV show, live games, and more. You can also press and hold the Home button to open a Control Center like menu, again similar to Google TV. You will also be able to pin more apps to the home screen. Previously you were limited to six large apps. The refreshed interface has space for up to 20 apps of your choosing. The refresh will begin rolling out next month in the U.S. to the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max 2nd Gen, and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series, and will be followed by more countries down the line. It will be available on the Ember TV series at launch.\n            \n    ",

Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware. AMD calls Helios \"The world's best AI rack\" During a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced—against a backdrop of dramatic music—\"Helios,\" the company's upcoming AI rack, which packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds. Each \"cross-section\" of these racks is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: the company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking it's real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.  AMD Ryzen AI 400 seriesIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking when compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V. These new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.\n            \n    ",

If you let someone else use your device—whether you're showing a friend a collection of photos or allowing a stranger to make an emergency call—there's a lot you don't want them to be able to see. If you're an iPhone user, there are several features you can enable to prevent others from snooping around your device. Use Guided AccessIf you don't want someone using your device to see anything else on it, you can turn on Guided Access, which limits them to a single app (such as Phone or Photos). This essentially locks down your screen and prevents navigation outside of the specific features you make available. \nFirst, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle the feature on. Tap Passcode Settings to set up a specific passcode or flip the Face ID toggle to use biometrics to end Guided Access sessions. To start a Guided Access session before handing over your phone, open the app and triple click the side button. You can circle specific areas of the screen you don't want to respond to touch (such as swipes through Photos).

To lock an app from your home screen, touch and hold the icon until the quick actions menu appears, then tap Require Face ID. Alternatively, you can hide apps so others cannot see them on your device (let alone open them) unless you authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. To hide an app, tap and hold the icon on the home screen and tap Require Face ID in the quick actions menu. Tap Hide and Require Face ID > Hide App. If you need to open a hidden app, swipe left on your home screen to reach your App Library, locate the Hidden folder at the bottom, and tap and authenticate to unlock the folder followed by the app. (Note that some native iOS apps, including Calculator, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Find My, Maps, Shortcuts, and Settings, cannot be locked, and system apps that come preinstalled cannot be hidden.)\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Unfortunately, this is very much a scam.  As BleepingComputer reports, these promo emails were sent from addresses on b.grubhub.com, a legitimate Grubhub subdomain, so they appear verified in recipients' inboxes. Two examples of senders include [email protected] and [email protected]. Beyond that, there are some pretty clear red flags. The subject line reads \"30 minutes left - We'll 10x your Bitcoin!\" to promote a sense of urgency and an offer too good to be true (but also too good to ignore). The body includes the recipient's name and instructions on how to participate in Grubhub's \"Holiday Crypto Promotion\" with a bitcoin wallet address. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nWhile Grubhub has acknowledged the problem, they haven't released any details as to what facilitated attackers sending emails using a company address. The company did suffer a major security breach earlier this year, resulting in the leak of some user data (including names and email addresses). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are several varieties of the crypto reward scamThe Grubhub email promotion is a pretty typical example of a cryptocurrency scam. The Federal Trade Commission outlines several variants, including get-rich-quick schemes guaranteeing big returns on your investment and celebrity-promoted \"giveaways\" that claim to multiply any funds you send.If you fall for crypto fraud, there's no way to track or get your money back, and even if victims are few and far between, scammers can score big paydays. That's why you should be especially wary of anything and everything requiring a crypto transaction, especially if the offer sounds urgent or provokes a sense of either excitement or fear. And remember that no legitimate organization—government agency, law enforcement official, utility company, or prize promoter—will ever ask for payments in cryptocurrency.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            ",

A great example of this: the Von Restorff effect, which refers to our brains’ acuity for remembering distinctive pieces of information over more uniform ones, a fact discovered by a German psychiatrist named Hedwig von Restorff. It’s an interesting fact of biology, but it can also be very useful to know when you’re studying a difficult concept. Here’s why, and how to put the Von Restorff effect to good use.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-von-restorff-effect\">What is the Von Restorff effect?</h2><p>In previous articles, I’ve discussed various memory effects you can capitalize on when you study, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-primacy-effect-can-help-you-remember-informat-1850432109\" target=\"_blank\">primacy effect</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-proust-effect-can-help-you-study-1850749025\" target=\"_blank\">Proust effect</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-production-effect-to-study-more-effectively-1850915123\" target=\"_blank\">production effect</a>. All of these begin with a nice, a round-looking “P\" and the consonant blend of \"Pr-.\" If I add the Von Restorff effect to that list, it will stand out solely because of the variety in its name—the rigid angle of that “V\" and the hard sound of the Restorff. Because of this, you’re more likely to remember the Von Restorff effect when asked to name the four memory phenomena we just went over—and <em>that’s </em>the Von Restorff effect in action.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the simplest terms, it is an “isolation effect” that ensures your brain will remember an item in a list if it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other entries on the list. When studying, you can achieve this effect by changing the meaningfulness of an item or a piece of information in some way, whether by color, size, font choice, or another approach.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-von-restorff-effect-to-remember-what-you-study\">How to use the Von Restorff effect to remember what you study</h2><p>The good news is that, unlike when you try to harness the power of other memory-based study techniques, this one is pretty straightforward. It's almost too simple, which is why you might not be familiar with it or ever have considered finding ways to use it. Once you realize the simplicity of this concept, it’s easy to find ways to work it into your study habits. </p><ul><li><p>In your notes, use a highlighter specifically to highlight words or concepts you need to remember for a test. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">Color-coding your notes</a> is a supremely helpful studying technique on its own because even taking the time to choose the colors and their meanings helps you focus. </p></li><li><p>When using flashcards, write concepts and words you’re having a hard time grasping in a different color. If you're using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner method</a> (which you should be), you can rewrite or recreate cards every time you drill them. With that technique, you move your cards into piles every time you get them right or wrong, then study the piles at different frequencies, focusing on ones you know less often than ones that are giving you trouble. Every few times you move a card up or down into a pile, try rewriting or recreating it with a different text color. If a card is red but your color for easy ones is blue, you'll be instantly reminded that this is one you recently struggled with, which can help you lock in and pull the information from your memory using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">active recall</a>. </p></li><li><p>When studying with others and talking through the material (or reading aloud from your notes), try associating a unique motion—like a specific hand gesture—with the concepts you’re discussing. </p></li><li><p>Use a shape, like a circle or box, to outline key parts of your notes or textbook materials. Do this when you're mind-mapping, especially, so all your mind maps are uniform. Dates can be in squares, vocab words in circles, and so on. To make quick and efficient mind maps, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">an app like Xmind</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">mind-mapping</a>, move the circle containing the most important concepts (or the one you’re struggling to grasp) to a more removed part of your page, differentiating it from the rest of the clusters visually. I do a version of this with my to-do list, which is written on a whiteboard on the fridge. Unusual things, like a doctor's visit or something I need to buy but don't usually get on my weekly trip to the grocery store, get written off to the side. They're more notable that way, drawing my attention away from the larger block of text and reminding me, over and over, that I have to do them. By the time doctor's appointment day rolls around or I'm in the store trying to remember my list, those are seared into my brain. </p></li><li><p>If you're revising your notes, use different text styles. This is something I did all the time in college, even when taking notes in class. I would bold anything a professor led into by announcing, \"This will be on the test.\" I would turn vocab words purple. Even if you're hand-writing (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">which you should be!</a>), you can draw squiggly underlines under certain ideas, circle others ... you get the point. Get zany with it, but keep it uniform. If you draw a big box around one date, do it to all of them. If you draw arrows pointing to a state law and a circle around a federal one, do it to all of them. </p></li></ul><p>The goal is to differentiate the things you need or struggle to remember using color, motion, shape, or even orientation. Setting certain ideas or words apart will make them stick in your brain better, no matter how you do it. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

/><p>Doing things the old-fashioned way and <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">hand-writing your notes</a> is better for retaining what you’ve learned, but it definitely has drawbacks that can make typing notes more appealing. Hand-written notes aren’t searchable on your phone or laptop, for example, and unlike your phone, your notebook probably won’t always be with you for a quick study session on the bus or train. That’s why you should take advantage of both methods: once you’ve written them out, you should digitize your notes in some fashion to make studying easier, blending the old style with the new. Here are the best ways to do so.</p><h2 id=\"the-easiest-way-to-digitize-your-notes-a-camera\">The easiest way to digitize your notes: A camera</h2><p>The most straightforward way to digitize your notes is by taking a picture of them and uploading it to your Google Drive or straight to your computer. You can name and file the images however you want, and though they won’t be easily searchable, they will be legible to you. Though this is <em>super </em>basic, it’s on the list because there’s one major advantage here: After uploading the image of your paper, you can stick it at the top of a document and use it as a guide to further revise your notes in the space for typing below. Manual revision (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">especially when done right after class</a>) is extremely beneficial to understanding and retention, so if you’re trying to grasp the content at hand, it might be better to just type and revise it all yourself than to, say, let an app or gadget do the work for you. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>That said, phones are getting smarter, and the built-in photos app on iPhone allows you to search for specific words within photos. For example, if you know you have a page of notes about the respiratory system saved as a photo, you should be able to search \"respiratory system\" or \"lungs\" or \"alveoli\" and it will search all your photos for those phrases. Google Photos has something similar.</p><p>On that note, let’s talk apps and gadgets. (No judgment.)</p><h2 id=\"use-an-app-to-digitize-your-notes\">Use an app to digitize your notes</h2><p>The most popular app for digitizing notes is Evernote, which advertises itself as a “pocket scanner” on your phone. You use an in-app camera to scan the document and, if your notes are “clearly written,” they’ll become editable and searchable. I tested this one out and didn't love it, but it's still the most popular and worth your time to consider. (You can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/evernote-notes-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">read my full review of Evernote here</a>.)</p><p>For what it's worth, in a head-to-head notes app battle, I tend to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/evernote-vs-notion-best-note-taking-app\" target=\"_blank\">favor Notion over Evernote</a>, but in this instance, that's not true because Notion doesn't allow for the scanning of handwritten notes. </p><p>If you want to hand-write <em>into </em>an app, try <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Microsoft OneNote</a>, which is free and easily converts what you write with your finger or stylus into searchable, editable text and makes it available across all your devices with Microsoft’s tools installed.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"use-a-smart-notebook-to-digitize-your-notes\">Use a smart notebook to digitize your notes</h2><p>To make the writing-to-digital process super easy, try a tool designed for the purpose: A smart notebook. You have a few options when it comes to devices that turn your writing into easily accessible notes. The most popular is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/76P54?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Rocketbook&short_url=76P54&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868&event_label=Rocketbook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Rocketbook</a> ($22–$40), which comes in a few different sizes and styles and is simple to use. You write on the pages with the pen that comes with it, scan the page with the associated app, and then wipe the page clean to start again, as whatever was already on it is syncing to your device. I picked one up for myself when I started grad school and got one for my boyfriend when he went back to school, too. We both found it easy to use, functional, and simple to transport. </p><p>While those are more like traditional paper and pen, you also have the option of a smart notebook that is more like a tablet. There are a number of these on the market, but Lifehacker's Joel Cunningham spent a year testing eight of them and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-digital-notebooks-you-can-buy-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">comprised this list of the best ones</a>. With e-ink notebooks tablets aimed at those who need an AI assist, those who require a lot of writing space, or those who also want to read textbooks and other materials on it, you'll find one that aligns with your own needs. Just be warned that with prices between $285 and $690, they're quite a bit pricier than the Rocketbook. Still, a resource that can help you through school and beyond is always a good investment. </p><p>For what it's worth, the best-performing one of the bunch is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z6Dbyj?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Boox%20Note%20Air%204C%2010.3-Inch%20Digital%20Notebook&short_url=z6Dbyj&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868&event_label=Boox%20Note%20Air%204C%2010.3-Inch%20Digital%20Notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Boox Note Air 4C 10.3-Inch Digital Notebook</a> ($530) for a few reasons. Its 10.3\" screen is big enough to write on, but not so big that it makes it hard to carry this thing around. The ease of writing with the stylus is notable, <a href=\"https://apollo-preview.lifehacker.com/tech/onyx-boox-note-air-4c-e-reader-review\" target=\"_blank\">according to Joel's review</a>, as is the varied functionality of its native note-taking app, which helps you not only write your notes, but organize them. </p><h2 id=\"make-a-mind-map-instead\">Make a mind map instead</h2><p>Revising your notes and turning them into readable, portable, and digital versions is smart no matter how you do it and you'll probably want to keep them, well, looking like notes. But there's value in making a mind map, too. Part of your revision process can be using an <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">app like Xmind </a>to create a visual mind map that shows the connections between the concepts, ideas, and facts in your notes. Studying with a mind map is helpful, especially for visual learners, because it helps you think critically about how everything you're going over works together, both while you're creating and reviewing the map. When you use an app to do it, your maps stay on your phone, so you still have the ease of studying whenever you can find time. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

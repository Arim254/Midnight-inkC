The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.If you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look. \n\n    \n            \n            There are plenty of categories to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.The home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to sign up for a MediaWiki account if you want to be able to contribute to the site too.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nHover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.Click through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Each movie comes with a cast list.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.Obviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.Free movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Devices lose support, standards are replaced, and software becomes obsolete. So it is with Microsoft Lens, whose days are numbered. Keen observers have known about this since August, when Microsoft first announced that Lens would be retired in September and removed from app stores in November. That obviously didn't happen, as the company adjusted the deadline to Dec. 15, which also came and went. Microsoft kicked the retirement can down the road—that is, until now. Microsoft Lens was Microsoft's solution for anyone in the mid-2010s who didn't own a scanner. Rather than buy an expensive piece of hardware to digitize documents, Lens allowed people to use their smartphone camera to turn those hard copies into digital files. It was hardly the only document scanner available on app stores (Apple's Notes app has had the function built in since iOS 11), but because it was made by Microsoft, it was a good solution for getting files into Microsoft apps like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. It's also free and compatible with both Android and iOS, making the app universally accessible. We even listed it first in our roundup of the best document scanner apps from 2021. According to the app's support document, Microsoft Lens officially began retirement proceedings on Jan. 9. That doesn't mean the app is dead, though: Microsoft will still support it until Feb. 9. After that, the app will receive no updates, and Microsoft will remove it from app stores. (If you're passionate or curious about Microsoft Lens, make sure to install it before then.) No matter what, however, you'll only have another month to use it. As of March 9, you will no longer be able to create new scans in Lens, but you'll still be able to view your previous scans as long as the app remains on your device.    \nThe best alternatives to Microsoft LensOnce we settle into mid-March, Microsoft Lens users will need to choose an alternative scanning app. Fortunately, there are plenty of options on app stores to choose from. In fact, you might not need to download anything new at all: As mentioned above, iPhone users can tap into the Notes app's built-in scanner, while Google Drive users can do the same.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMicrosoft, of course, wants you to stay within the ecosystem, so they'd prefer you use OneDrive's built-in scanner. If you already have that app on your phone, it might be as good an option as any. However, there are popular, dedicated apps, like Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, and Photomyne, that offer additional features not available in built-in scanners.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications. Maybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.The application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).The whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.It's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.I don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Unfortunately, that improved experience tends to come at a much higher price. But there are budget monitors that go on sale, making it much more affordable to upgrade your gaming without hurting your wallet too much. Samsung is currently selling its 34-inch Samsung Odyssey G5 for $279.99 (originally $399.99).\nThe Samsung Odyssey G5 is a great ultra-wide monitor for those who haven't used one before, with all the important specs you'd want while keeping the price relatively low. Other high-end, bigger ultra-wide monitors go upwards of $700, like the Odyssey OLED G9. Those are much bigger and offer OLED quality visuals, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Odyssey G5 comes with a 1000R curve, which Samsung claims is optimal to avoid eye strain. Your media will be displayed on a 21:9 aspect ratio and 3440x1440 resolution, which means if you watch videos that are not compatible with that ratio, it'll have some black space on the sides to prevent it from looking stretched. You also get a 165Hz refresh rate and native FreeSync variable refresh rate (VRR) support, helping fast games look smoother. The input lag is 1ms, which is very fast for a budget gaming monitor. It's also compatible with HDR10, so watching movies or shows will look good, but mostly in dark rooms since the HDR peak brightness isn't very high.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        As someone who regularly switches between the Mac and PC, I really can't live without the PowerToys app on Windows. It adds little missing features that I really like on the Mac, like a Spotlight Search alternative, auto dark mode, screen awake, on-screen OCR (which lets you pull text from images), and more.But the reverse is also true. When I'm on MacOS, I start to miss the little features and commands that I've been used to Windows having for decades now (I started using Windows in school, but was only exposed to macOS when I was in college).It's the little things, like not being able to cut and paste files in Finder. And why must I accidentally open the Music app every time I press the play button? This is just the beginning.\nEnter Supercharge, a utility from prolific indie developer Sindre Sorhus. Think of it not as a single app, but as a Swiss army knife for your menu bar—a collection of micro-utilities designed to patch the specific usability holes that Apple has left open, many of which Microsoft has already plugged. The app offers an unlimited free trial (with a prompt to upgrade every 12 hours), or you can buy it outright for $18. It's also available as part of a Setapp subscription. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Supercharge\n                    \n    \nThe best Supercharge tweaks that you should enableThe Supercharge app works in two ways. The first is by giving you a set-and-forget settings menu. Secondly, it adds a menu bar app where you can quickly access small features on the fly.The tweaks part, to me, is a lot more interesting. Once the app is installed, open the menu bar app and go to Settings. Go to the Tweaks tab and take some time to customize your Mac's behavior.Make Finder work more like Windows File Explorer\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe Finder is where Supercharge shines, fixing legacy behaviors that have frustrated Windows switchers for years. The first thing I enabled was the \"Cut and Paste\" functionality. Finally, you can use Cmd+X to cut a file and Cmd+V to move it, eliminating the awkward Cmd+C followed by Cmd+Option+V dance required by default.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nBeyond moving files, the app allows you to enable the Option+N shortcut to instantly create a new text file in your current folder—another Windows muscle memory I've had for decades. Additional tweaks include toggling the Enter key to open a file instead of renaming it, and an option to show hidden files by default.Mission Control featuresApple's Mission Control provides a bird's-eye view of all your windows, but it's hardly interactive. Supercharge changes that by adding window management buttons directly to the overlay. You can now add dedicated Close, Minimize, and Quit buttons for every window inside Mission Control, helping you clear cluttered app windows in seconds, and in a fairly visual way.Dock enhancementsSupercharge also brings much-needed flexibility to the Dock, making it more like the taskbar on Windows or Linux. Enable the Click-to-Hide feature, and you can minimize or hide an app simply by clicking on the app icon. My favorite, though, is the option to open folders directly in the Finder from the Dock. You can also set Supercharge to add spacers to the Dock, and quit apps using the middle-click mouse button.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Apple Music app fixPerhaps the most useful fix in the entire suite is the ability to stop Apple Music from launching automatically. This feature stops the app from popping up when you press Play on your keyboard or Bluetooth headphones. If you are a dedicated Spotify user or simply dislike it when your headphones accidentally wake up Apple Music, this feature alone makes a Supercharge installation worth it.Other useful featuresThe Supercharge app includes several other quality-of-life improvements. The Notification Nuke feature allows you to set a global hotkey to instantly clear all notifications from Notification Center, acting as a panic button for focus. To prevent accidents, you can also enable Accidental Quit Prevention, which requires a double-press or a Shift + Cmd + Q combo to actually quit an application.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe second part of the equation here is the menu bar app. Here, you can add small missing features that usually require downloading separate apps. There are more than two dozen options. Go to Settings > General > Show Menu Items to see the whole list.Here, you can add options to quickly capture and copy any text from an image (or translate it). There are one-click options for hiding all windows, showing the desktop, quitting all apps except the current one, clearing all notifications, and more. There's also a simple Keep Awake feature that will keep your Mac active even when the screen is off. And there's also a simple default browser switcher built-in, though I prefer using Sindre's dedicated Default Browser app.\n            ",

Its latest flagship portable speaker is the ULT Field 5, which launched along with the ULT Field t and ULT Tower 9 last spring, all made to be portable and rugged. This speaker falls between the ULT Field 3 and the ULT Field 7, giving a good middle ground of portability and power. Right now, you can get the biggest one of the lineup for $219 (originally $329.99), the lowest price it has been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe ULT Field 5 is a bass-heavy portable speaker that works for those who value long battery life and portability, as you can read in PCMag's \"excellent\" review. It comes with a ten-band EQ, an actual woofer (which is surprising given its portable size), an ULT mode which boosts the base, an IP67 rating (waterproof, dustproof, shockproof, and rustproof), and the ability to connect to other speakers through Party Connect.With the ULT Power on, you can expect 25 hours of battery, making this speaker competitive in its market. Blasting it at full volume will drain the battery much faster, though, giving you five hours max. A quick 10-minute charge gets you two hours of juice, which is important for a portable speaker. The sound is stereo, and you can use multi-room if you have other Sony speakers to play media simultaneously with the companion app.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis speaker is designed for parties, the outdoors, or larger working spaces. It does come with a shoulder strap that you can hook into the speaker for throwing it over your shoulder, adding to its portability. It uses the Sound Connect app, so people who are part of the Sony ecosystem will get the most out of it. You can see the battery life, control the EQ, connect to other Sony devices, and use the DJ Control feature that lets you add scratching and air horn sounds to your music.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This is a QLED Mini LED TV, so while it's not at the quality that OLED TVs can offer, it makes up for it with a much lower price. Right now, the 65-inch Hisense Class U6 Series TV is $529.96 (originally $847.99), the lowest price it has been, according to price-checking tools.\nDon't let the budget price fool you; this is a quality TV. The best one of 2025, according to PCMag's \"outstanding\" review. Its main attributes are its incredible levels of brightness, peaking at 1,024 nits, and its beautiful colors. This is expected from a QLED Mini LED TV, but not for under $550 for a 65-inch TV. It is also packed with features and specs that you won't find in other TVs at this price.The refresh rate is 144Hz with VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, making it a good option to play games. You'll get an input lag of 4.6 ms at 1080p and 13.1 ms at 4K. For those who pay premium in their streaming apps for HDR, you'll be able to take advantage of HDR10+ and Dolby Vision IQ. If you have a surround sound system, you'll also be able to take advantage of Dolby Atmos for a more immersive, 3D sound.The biggest downside, in my opinion, is that the OS is Amazon’s Fire TV, but that's fixable with a TV stick, and also down to preference. While there is no hands-free voice control, there is Apple AirPlay for casting devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're looking for a 65-inch TV that punches above its price tag, is at a great discount, offers great colors, brightness, and features, get the Hisense Class U6 Series TV.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Right now, the RingConn Gen 2 smart ring is 20% off in gold, future silver, and rose gold at $239.20 (originally $299), making this wearable the perfect tech-meets-jewelry gift for yourself or a partner with Valentine’s Day on the horizon.  \nSizing is especially important with a smart ring since the sensors need consistent skin contact to track activity accurately. Ring Conn offers a free sizing kit to help you accurately gauge this, and they also have an easy-to-follow sizing chart. Gen 2 is RingConn’s full-featured model, compared to the more entry-level, budget-friendly Gen Air 2, which was reviewed by PCMag. Its 12-day battery life (double that of its predecessor) is one of the biggest perks, as it has a lightweight, ultra-thin design that isn’t noticeable, especially when you’re sleeping. With data and insights included with the purchase, it offers an alternative to subscription-based health tracking like the Oura. The RingConn Gen 2 measures stats like heart rate, blood oxygen, HRV/stress index, and activity, as well as sleep stages and sleep apnea monitoring, which is a relatively new innovation in the wearable category. It also lasts up to 100 meters underwater, making it suitable for shower use or swimming. This smart ring is compatible with both Android and iOS, and it works with both Google Fit and Apple Health. That said, some users say the app isn’t as user-friendly as competitors and certain insights require you to interpret trends on your own rather than getting actionable coaching that some rivals provide. It also may be prone to scratching over time compared to more rugged options like the Oura Ring Gen 4, but it comes with a 12-month warranty. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re looking for a long-lasting wearable health tracker that doesn’t require a subscription but still has similar core features as pricier competitors, the RingConn Gen 2 smart ring is a great option. While its data presentation may be slightly less polished and lacks coaching features, it offers the same basic-to-advanced health metrics as better-known brands at a lower upfront cost and with no recurring fees—especially at the current discount. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The Beats Studio Pro headphones in factory-reconditioned condition are down to $94.99 on Woot. \nFor comparison, the same model listed as “refurbished: excellent” costs $135 on Amazon, while a brand-new pair is currently $199.99 (marked down from $349.99). This deal runs for two days or until it sells out, and Prime members get free standard shipping (while everyone else pays a $6 shipping fee). Note that shipping isn’t available to Alaska, Hawaii, PO boxes, or APO addresses.The Beats Studio Pro are a premium-feeling set of noise-canceling headphones that lean heavily into comfort and polish. The build feels sturdy, the padding is generous, and they’re easy to wear for long stretches without pressure fatigue. Sound quality sticks to the familiar Beats formula: pronounced bass with crisp, slightly elevated highs. It’s not the most neutral tuning—listeners who prefer a flatter, studio-style sound may find it colored—but it works well for pop, hip-hop, and electronic playlists. Plugging in via USB-C unlocks hi-res audio and three preset EQ modes, which noticeably improve clarity. The downside is that those EQ presets aren’t available over Bluetooth, and there’s no manual EQ option at all.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCodec support is another limitation. Wireless audio tops out at SBC and AAC, meaning Android users miss out on higher-quality options like AptX or LDAC. As for its ANC, it is competent but unremarkable. It does a decent job with low-frequency noise but struggles more in crowded or high-pitched environments, and you can hear a faint hiss when ANC is enabled, notes this PCMag review. Battery life, however, holds up well: Expect around 24 hours with ANC on, or up to 40 hours without it. The Studio Pro won’t dethrone Sony or Bose if noise cancellation or deep audio customization is your top priority. But for casual listeners who value comfort, long battery life, and smooth Apple device integration, this price makes the trade-offs much easier to accept.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When I did, the site reloaded, but now without any posts—only the futile option to try reloading again.You can see a steep spike in user reports on Downdetector (which, for full disclosure, is owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis). At the time of writing, roughly 25,000 users had reported issues with X, I among them. There are a number of potential reasons why X won't load this morning, but it doesn't appear to be a larger issue with a cloud hosting service. Anytime a major website like X goes down, it harkens back to global outages, stemming from issues with cloud hosting services like AWS and Cloudflare. However, a quick check on Downdetector shows me that few other sites and services are having massive outage reports at the moment. That could change, but as of this article, it seems like X's issues are their own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nX will no doubt get things back up and running soon.

However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons. The new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCurrently, there's a waitlist to sign up for ChatGPT Health, and over time it will roll out to all users. At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026. While the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.How Ford AI Assistant worksFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time. \nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.   \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWill Ford AI Assistant actually be useful?As someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.Of course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.  \n            \n    ",

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything.

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies.

Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.The free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.To get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.The third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.It's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can read more on the project's Github page.\n            \n    ",

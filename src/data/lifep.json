Today, YouTube announced that it's going to allow creators to upload bigger thumbnails, plus make browsing and shopping while watching on a TV a bit more convenient. But there's also a big change coming to content itself, and it's not just limited to TVs. Soon, YouTube is going to start using AI to automatically upscale any videos with resolutions lower than 1080p. While you can technically still upload videos that are 720p nowadays, with smartphone cameras getting better and better, that essentially reads to me as \"old videos.\" It's a bit concerning to me, as someone who's been watching a lot of TV shows from the '90s and early 2000s on YouTube as of late.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: YouTube\n                    \n    \nDone right, AI upscaling is a simple way to de-noise a video, and is more resistant to hallucination than generations made from whole cloth. But it's not without its own hiccups, and some creators have actually accused YouTube of using AI upscaling already, without telling them, and with some undesirable results. The accusations have been limited to YouTube Shorts for now, but notably, even Will Smith seems to have possibly run afoul of the system's hidden AI, as the celebrity was himself accused of generating a crowd with AI in a YouTube Short of a recent concert. However, internet sleuths have determined the footage is likely legit, but was automatically made to look like \"AI slop\" by YouTube. Note, for instance, how different the footage looks on Instagram.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLuckily, YouTube says that this version of AI upscaling will be fully in the hands of creators and users. According to the feature's announcement \"Creators will retain complete control over their library, as both original files and original video resolution will be kept intact, with a clear option to opt-out of these enhancements.\" Viewers, meanwhile, will be able to see when AI upscaling has been used thanks to a \"super resolution\" label in the resolution selection settings, and opt for the original resolution instead.Additionally, YouTube told The Verge that videos that were shot below 1080p, but manually remastered and uploaded in 1080p or above, won't be affected by the upscaling tech. What matters is the resolution the video was uploaded in.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of that's a relief for folks like me, who don't want bizarre seven-fingered extras in our sitcoms, although it's unclear whether this control will also extend to YouTube Shorts, or if YouTube might continue experimenting with mandatory AI upscaling there behind-the-scenes (which, to be fair, has not yet been confirmed).Regardless, it makes sense why YouTube is making this change, as it tries to capture more eyes across more devices. Low resolution videos might look fine on a six-inch smartphone display, but blown up to 50+ inches on a TV, not so much. YouTube hasn't said exactly when the feature will go live, but if you notice what looks like weird AI artifacting the next time you're watching a YouTube video, try checking the resolution settings by mousing over the video and tapping or clicking the cog icon.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Unlike an LCD, which uses a single backlight for all the pixels of the display, all of the pixels on an OLED display can be individually lit up or turned off entirely. That means dark areas of the screen are inky black, while brighter areas can be selectively illuminated. It just looks fantastic, and if I have the option, I always try to choose it.OLED isn't new tech at this point, and yet, Apple has been slow to adopt it into its products, especially when compared to some of its competitors. The company's first device to feature OLED was the Apple Watch in 2015, then the iPhone X in 2017, whereas every Samsung Galaxy has featured an AMOLED display since the company introduced the line in 2010. The iPhone remained the only product line with OLED for quite some time, until it included them with the M4 iPad Pros. Aside from these products, Apple tends to choose alternative display types for its devices. For certain products, like the iMac, MacBook Air, and most iPads, it still uses LCD. For more \"premium\" devices, like the MacBook Pro, it uses mini-LED, which offers a large number of backlight \"zones.\" This gives these products more contrast than the single backlight of LCD, but not quite as much as OLED. I prefer watching shows and movies on my iPad with mini-LED than my LCD iMac, for example, but I'd always prefer my OLED TV.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple's OLED roadmapAs it turns out, Apple might give me some new OLED options in the future. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is working on bringing OLED to more of its devices. Gurman says that the company is currently testing the tech for the MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Air, all of which now ship with LCD. In addition, the company is reportedly working on an OLED MacBook Pro, which might also ship with a touchscreen.Before you get too excited for an OLED MacBook, Apple is likely starting the OLED rollout with the iPad—specifically, the iPad mini. Gurman's sources say the OLED mini will drop sometime next year, which would mark the first refresh for the device since 2024. While I'd love an OLED Mac, this might be the perfect excuse for me to pick up an iPad mini, which I've long thought of as the most fun of Apple's devices.Gurman isn't sure when Apple will add OLED to the iPad Air, but it won't be with the next refresh. The next-gen iPad Air will likely launch this spring, and will ship with LCD. That's true for the M5 MacBook Air, as well. While Apple is testing OLED for the Air, the next model will be out this spring sporting the same display tech as the M4. An OLED MacBook Air might not hit stores until 2028.If you'll buy any Mac that Apple sells with OLED, you're going to be buying a Pro. That OLED MacBook Pro might even come with a touchscreen, which would be a first for Apple's Mac line. That machine could be out as early as 2026, but Apple could also push them to 2027.Adding OLED to products won't come cheap, though. Gurman suggests that Apple could raise the price of the iPad mini $100, which would drive the starting cost from $499 to $599. When those OLED MacBook Pros come out, they'll also likely be even more expensive than the current Pros, by at least a few hundred dollars. These machines start at $1,999 (14-inch) and $2,499 (16-inch) today, so their OLED, touchscreen counterparts could fetch a high price tag. You probably shouldn't wait for these devices if you need to upgradeIf you're holding out on buying any new Apple tech until the company refreshes those devices with OLED, you're going to be waiting a while—at least, for anything other than the iPad mini. I'd recommend waiting for that particular device, but for the others, it might be a while indeed. If you really need an upgrade, Apple's current iPad Pros ship with OLED, and the mini-LED tech in its MacBook Pros is also excellent. But even the LCDs on its devices look quite good. If you can stomach seeing the backlight when dark elements are on-screen, an iPad Air or MacBook Air will suit you well. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I love my M1 iMac, but I worry that Apple's first version of this new update isn't quite optimized for the five-year-old chip, and have been waiting to see if a future version of Tahoe performs a bit better. As it happens, that next version is well on its way—and does seem improved, at that. Apple has been beta testing macOS Tahoe 26.1 alongside iOS 26.1 since September, and it dropped the release candidates for both of the updates on Tuesday. The \"RC,\" as the name implies, is what Apple thinks is the finished version of any given software release. Barring any major bugs or glitches discovered by developers and public testers, this will be the version of macOS Tahoe 26.1 released to the general public. That release will likely come next week. In the meantime, we know what features Apple has in store for Mac users who decide to update. This is a much smaller revision than macOS 26, but 26.1 does bring some interesting new features for users to explore. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nControl over Liquid Glass' appearanceBy far the most striking difference between this year's Apple updates and last year's is Liquid Glass. This new design language is Apple's most drastic UI change in years, and while some people love it, others hate it. I've enjoyed the new look on my iPhone, but I understand why some users dislike how some elements let the background shine through, in some cases reducing visibility.Apple seems to have taken the criticism to heart: With macOS Tahoe, as well as iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1, the company now gives users the option to control how Liquid Glass looks, at least to a degree. The new toggle, which you can find in System Settings >  Appearance, has two options: \"Clear,\" which retains the original look of Liquid Glass, and \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of your system's UI elements. With Tinted, you won't see as much of the background poke through, and whatever does come through doesn't take over the overlayed element as much. If you find Liquid Glass in macOS Tahoe too clear and \"glassy,\" this might be a good option to try. Expanded support for Apple Music AutoMix Apple's latest round of updates introduced a new DJ-like feature to Apple Music. AutoMix will automatically build a transition between songs, fading one song into another. It's a cool feature (when it works well), and can make transitioning between dissimilar songs a lot smoother.With macOS 26.1, AutoMix now works over AirPlay. Previously, you lost this feature when beaming your music to an AirPlay device.Better FaceTime audio qualityApple says that Mac users updating to 26.1 should experience improved FaceTime audio quality in low-bandwidth conditions. The company doesn't elaborate, but this is good news on its, uh, face: If you're calling someone in a low-signal area, or with a weak wifi connection, you should be able to hear each other better.Communication Safety and Web content filters for child accountsIf your Mac has child accounts (made for ages 13 through 17), Communication Safety and Web content filters will be enabled by default for those accounts after updating to this latest version. These filters are designed to limit adult websites, protecting underage users from content they shouldn't be accessing. A new Network iconAs spotted by the MacOSBeta subreddit, Apple has updated the Network icon for macOS 26.1. The new icon looks great, in my opinion, sporting a blue theme with glow effects:\nA new Macintosh HD iconSimilarly, the Macintosh HD icon gets a small refresh. The original Tahoe icon was a major redesign over the previous, iconic icon. Now, Apple has removed the additional elements to simplify the design. (I still miss the original.) \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nA few security updates, probablyApple hasn't announced security updates for macOS 26.1 yet, but in all likelihood, they will. Apple doesn't often issue true security patches like other companies, barring an emergency patch. Instead, the company usually bundles its security patches within point updates like 26.1. Once the official update drops, expect Apple to update its security release notes to include details about these patches.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The guidelines from public health organizations tell you to aim for at least 150 minutes of “moderate” exercise each week, and that each minute of “vigorous” exercise counts double. That raises the question: What the hell is “moderate” exercise? How do you know when you’re doing it? Scientists measure METs, but you don't have to If you have any kind of smartwatch or fitness tracker, it may try to tell you that \"moderate\" exercise occurs at a certain heart rate. This isn't actually the case. The scientists who came up with the exercise guidelines didn't use heart rate as their guide. Instead, they used charts that measured how many \"METs,\" or metabolic equivalents, each type of exercise requires. I'll explain more about METs below, but the important thing to know is that the type and intensity of exercise is what tells you whether it's moderate, not your heart rate while you're doing it. You can look up exercises on a chart like this one, but here's the basic idea: \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWalking is moderate, jogging or running is vigorous.Bicycling is moderate if it’s under about 12 miles per hour on the flat.Indoor cycling is moderate if it’s up to about 100 watts of power.All that said, you don’t have to overthink it. The guidelines that mention “moderate” and “vigorous” activities aren’t asking you to monitor your heart rate or any other numeric metric. They want you thinking in terms of generalities: walking versus running, leisurely bike commuting versus sweating your heart out in a spin studio.And honestly, if it’s easier to watch your heart rate than to worry about the above, that’s fine. For most of us, 150 minutes of Zone 2 is going to be at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise. So follow that guideline, and you’ll be an overachiever.It’s not really about heart rateSo why does your watch want to steer you toward a certain heart rate during exercise? Mostly because that's easy to measure. Moderate exercise sorta-kinda matches up to \"zone 2\" cardio, which I’ve previously explained. (Zone 2 is is the second-lowest intensity in a five-zone system, and the easiest way to know which zone you're in is to glance at your fitness watch.)While you can use heart rate zones as a rule of thumb to find moderate exercise, this idea falls short in two ways: (1) different gadgets and systems use different cutoffs to decide which numbers count as \"zone 2\", and (2) for most of us, zone 2 includes most moderate activities but also some vigorous activities. If you’re relatively fit, you can jog at a 12 minute-per-mile pace while keeping your heart rate in zone 2. That’s a “vigorous” activity in terms of METs, though. The other reason heart rate isn’t accurate for this task is that your heart rate changes for all kinds of reasons. The hotter it is when you're working out, the higher your heart rate tends to be. Same goes for when you’re nervous or stressed. And as you get fitter, you’ll be able to do the same activities at a lower heart rate. Those activities might feel easier than they used to, but they’re not any less work. What is a MET, anyway?One MET is the energy expended when you’re at rest—the amount of oxygen, calories, etc that it takes to keep you alive and breathing. (We use oxygen in the process of burning calories, so officially a MET is 3.2 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.) Researchers can then put a mask on a person and measure how much oxygen they use while running, walking, playing guitar, etc. If an activity takes twice as much oxygen as sitting still, they say it takes two METs. Here are a few examples (taken from this scientific paper): 2 MET: washing dishes, or playing croquet3 MET: walking at 3 miles per hour (a pretty typical walking pace)4 MET: table tennis, ice skating5 MET: modern dance, fast-paced ballroom dance6 MET: volleyball, singles tennis7 MET: jogging, jumping ropeThe numbers go up from there. Speed skating clocks in at 15 MET. To be clear, you will not be measuring METs directly when you exercise. The MET studies are done in labs so that we can use the information to get a sense of what MET values each common type of exercise tends to have.Moderate exercise is 3 to 6 MET, and vigorous is 6 or moreThe physical activity guidelines define “moderate” exercise as at least 3 MET, but less than 6. Vigorous is 6 MET or more. Because METs are specific to the activity, not to how fit you are, it makes the most sense to look at METs in terms of the pace you run or the settings you use on your treadmill or other cardio machine. Here are paces and activities that have been clocked as between 3 and 6 METs: Walking at 3-4 mph (a 15-minute to 20-minute mile)Cycling, between 50 to 100 wattsShooting basketsPlaying baseballTaking a low-impact aerobics classAnd these are vigorous (6 or more MET): Race walking (5+ mph) Walking uphillWalking with a 12-pound packJogging (a 12-minute mile is 8.0 MET; the faster you go, the higher the MET)Bicycling at 12 miles per hour or fasterSwimming lapsPlaying a game of basketball, soccer, or hockeySo when you're trying to get your 150 minutes (or more) of moderate exercise each week, you can count all your walking, your easy bike riding, and your low-impact aerobics class. Give yourself credit for vigorous exercise for all the time you spend jogging (at any heart rate), lap swimming, or rucking. You may find you've been doing more exercise than you think.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

But if you happen to be a visual learner, there’s one in particular that might be suited for you: mind mapping. Mind maps are diagrams designed to organize information and data points that relate to each other, making everything you need to do easier to follow. They're particularly popular for students who need to visualize how the concepts they're studying link together, but they have wide applications outside the classroom.What is a mind map?A mind map isn’t just a diagram that lays out tasks. Rather, it does so in a hierarchical way, connecting things that are related and making it clear which need to be done first in order to move on to the next task. (When used for studying, on the other hand, they help bridge connections between main topics and those that branch off from them, plus relate to one another.)\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nYou can use mind maps for a variety of reasons, whether you want to think clearer or set goals with them, but for our purposes, we’ll go over how they can be used as productivity tools. You can also try them for word-associating, brainstorming, note-taking, and more once you get the hang of it.Start by writing the main idea of what you need to do. For instance, if you have to make a new hire, write that right in the center and draw a circle around it. Then, use arrows to branch off into related tasks: HR tasks, onboarding tasks, financial tasks, etc. From each of these, you draw more arrows. HR tasks might involve legal paperwork and background checks. Onboarding may require getting your new hire access to training modules and finding them a workspace. Financial tasks could include setting up payroll and getting them certain benefits enrollment information.After creating the mind map, you’ll see all the tasks laid out in a  web that will help you visualize and grasp everything you need to do. It all leads back to that one main responsibility. The subtasks will equate to all the little things you need to do to make it all happen, piece by piece, until you end up fulfilling that final goal in the center.How to make your own mind mapAbove, we talked about drawing circles, which is fine if you prefer the old paper-and-pen method. You can make them in Word or Google Docs, but those can be clunky. A better option is to use an online creativity tool, like Canva or Draw.io. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAn even better option than that is to use software dedicated to the task. My favorite is Xmind, which you can use on your computer or phone and comes pre-loaded with a bunch of templates. The actual creation process can be helpful for brainstorming, but is a pain if you're not graphically inclined. Xmind makes it a lot easier, especially for beginners, because you just drag and drop the shapes and lines around a canvas designed for this exact purpose.Why this worksThe simplicity of a mind map is what makes it so effective. Keywords, not long phrases, and color-coding lend themselves to quick processing and recall, while the hierarchical nature of the tasks helps you see what order you need to handle them in. The overarching task at the center serves as a reminder of what you're even doing all those little things for, which helps keep you motivated and on track. The simple flow of arrows links ideas and the spacing of the boxes keeps categories organized. Overall, it’s a great solution for visual learners or anyone in a rush, and it’s not as clumsy or convoluted as a large spreadsheet or planning document. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Maybe it's because I was an only child, but as useless as the animated paperclip (officially known as \"Clippit,\" by the way) was for advice, I did enjoy having a buddy on my desktop while I worked on essays. Now, Microsoft is bringing that same energy back, but for AI. And, finally, I think I understand the Clippy hate.Called Mico, the character is part of Copilot's fall release, which includes a dozen new updates. Some of these are what you'd expect by now: There's a new memory feature that ensures every new conversation doesn't start from scratch, and better integration with outside apps like Gmail or Google Calendar. But there's also a few more out-there ideas, like using Copilot Mode in Edge (which originally released in July) to pick up old browsing sessions right where you left off, even if you already closed all your tabs.By far, though, the most unexpected update is for Microsoft to lean back into its old animated mascot tendencies. Mico isn't the first AI companion, nor is it the most expressive. Grok will sell you on a whole anime girlfriend, if you're into that. But it does call back to a pedigree I once thought long buried (and now, I realize, maybe for good reason).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLike Clippy, and unlike Grok, Mico leans more towards the cute side of things, and is just a small, smiling, disembodied blob. It's entirely optional, but the idea is that it works with Copilot's voice input to make you feel like you're being listened to, changing color and reacting based on the tone of the conversation.If that all sounds a bit vague, it's because, well, Mico (and the rest of the Copilot fall release) is still rolling out. I don't have access to it yet, so the best I can do is check out this video shared by Microsoft.\nThe idea, though, is clearly to make AI seem friendlier. Microsoft announced Mico in a post titled \"Human-centered AI,\" and made a point out of debuting the character alongside a new \"real talk\" mode, which the company says \"challenges assumptions with care, adapts to your vibe, and helps conversations spark growth and connection.\"And I think that's where I finally start to raise my eyebrows a bit. On the plus side, in Microsoft's video, Mico doesn't appear to actually talk, so much as play simple animations. It's not going to build a parasocial relationship with you to the degree that Elon Musk's animated AI girlfriend, which comes with a romance bar to level up, does. On the other hand, though, it still feels like a way to lower my guard. Describing Mico to The Verge, corporate VP of product and growth at Microsoft AI Jacob Andreou said \"All the technology fades into the background, and you just start talking to this cute orb and build this connection with it.\"But what does it mean to be \"connected\" to a face that is inherently tied to a product?Essentially, with Mico, you're now looking at a big smiley face whenever you interact with Microsoft's AI, even as it continues to try to look at your screen, or redirect your web traffic, or bloat your computer with features that, according to testing done by TechRadar, can hurt performance. Maybe, actually, I should have my guard up when interacting with AI and not letting the technology fade out of my mind.For instance, Mico's release comes a week after Microsoft announced an initiative to \"Make every Windows 11 PC an AI PC.\" It's no wonder the company wants to give it a friendly face while it advertises features that take action for you based on simple voice commands. But am I comfortable with a future where I just tell my computer what I want, with little direct involvement, and expect the company that runs the cloud powering it to know what that means?To a degree, I can see the convenience in that. But it also leaves me at the whims of Microsoft, and it's hard not to see Mico's friendly smile as a way to spin that as a good thing, rather than as a loss in control. At least Clippy could look sarcastic.Maybe I'm overreacting, but in the same blog where Microsoft introduced Mico, it also debuted \"Copilot for health\" and \"Learn Live.\" In the former, the company actively encourages you to take your health questions to its AI, while the latter supposedly lets Copilot act as a \"voice-enabled Socratic tutor.\" Microsoft promises that Copilot for health, at least, pulls from credible sources like Harvard Health, but as AI continues to face security risks and accusations of model collapse, I remain skeptical about letting it aid in self-diagnosing or tutoring my kid.And perhaps that's on me. When I finally get Copilot's fall release, it could prove itself. But Mico is the exact type of mascot that's meant to dismantle skepticism while it's still healthy. It benefits Microsoft, but \"corporate-centered AI\" and \"human-centered AI\" aren't the same thing. At best, I think Mico will seem obnoxious, in the same way enforced positivity usually does. But at worst, it comes across as a first attempt to make your computer seem like a friend you make requests of, rather than a machine you own. While users fight for right-to-repair and warn about dropping tech literacy among people who spend all their time with computers, it's hard not to see the idea of Copilot as a friend rather than something a bit more sinister.The Clippy connections aren't just in my head, for what it's worth. Andreou also told The Verge that \"Clippy walked so that we [Mico] could run.\" But as we approach Halloween, I'd like to remind Microsoft that sometimes, dead is better.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Right now, subscribers to YouTube TV, the company's live TV service, are waiting to learn if they'll still have access to Disney-operated channels, including ABC and ESPN, come Oct.31. It's the latest conflict in ongoing fee disputes between Google and its various content providers, but even if Disney takes its ball and goes home, you won't be left entirely without options.When could Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV?According to Variety, if Disney and Google are unable to reach a deal by the end of Thursday, all Disney networks will vanish from YouTube TV on Oct. 30 at midnight ET. These include Disney Channel, ESPN, ABC News, Disney Jr., FX, FXX, FRXM, NatGeo, Freefrom, and even local ABC stations. It's not the first time YouTube has been through something like this. Last February, Paramount made a similar threat before eventually reaching an agreement that saw no pause in customer access to its channels. Since then, YouTube has had similar conflicts with Fox Corp., NBC Universal, and Univision, with only the Spanish-language network failing to reach a deal before its channels went dark.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's all about licensing feesWhat's happening here all comes down to licensing fees. To offer channels like the cable providers it's trying to replace, YouTube TV has to continually pay fees to content providers, and occasionally, those providers propose higher fees. That leaves YouTube in a bit of a lurch, as it tries to navigate between paying a fair price to its partners while also avoiding raising prices for its subscribers.Disney told Variety that, \"[t]his is the latest example of Google exploiting is position as the expense of their own customers,\" implying that Google was risking stripping away channels its customers had paid for by refusing to compensate Disney with \"fair rates.\" Google in turn argues that giving into Disney's \"costly economic terms\" would force the company to \"raise prices on YouTube TV,\" as well as leave the service in a rough spot when compared to Disney's own Live TV offering, Hulu + Live TV.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat happens if a deal isn't reachedPersonally, I wouldn't take either company's statement too seriously, at least if the earlier Paramount and NBC Universal conflicts are anything to go by—there's a good chance a deal will be reached before YouTube TV subscribers are affected. But as with those earlier conflicts, YouTube is willing to make it up to its customers if they lose access to Disney content.\"If it [Disney content] remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit,\" YouTube said. That would be enough to subscribe to a month of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle with ads, although YouTube hasn't said if the credit will be recurring.Currently, a YouTube TV Base Plan starts at $72.99/month for your first three months, then jumps up to $82.99/month after that, making it slightly less expensive than Hulu + Live TV in the long term ($64.99/month for the first three months, then $89.99/month after that). Whether prices will stay the same if Disney pulls its channels remains to be seen.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

As he tells it, deep work is a state where you find the ability to focus completely on a demanding task without letting distraction get in your way. If you can get the hang of it, you’ll get more done in less time and ultimately end up feeling more fulfilled. On his website, Newport observes that it’s rare to see someone feel energized and happy after sending emails, but there’s a sense of fulfillment that comes from sustained focus on more meaningful tasks.How do you achieve deep work?Newport draws a distinction between deep work and “shallow work,” or that which can be accomplished while you’re distracted. Deep work is for “cognitively demanding” tasks, whereas shallow work prepares you for deep work. Creating a project deck is deep work. Emailing colleagues to coordinate data for it is shallow work. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIf you’re having a hard time determining what is and is not deep work, Newport has some guidelines. Shallow work tends “to not create new value in the world” and is “easy to replicate.”The key, then, is first sorting your work into deep and shallow categories. Determine which of your tasks are cognitively demanding and valuable and which are “logistical-style” and replicable. Next, plan to devote an hour or an hour and a half to deep-work tasks, then schedule it so you have that time blocked off in your schedule. (As for blocking off your scheduling, familiarize yourself with time boxing and time blocking, which call on you to schedule every minute of your day and input it, moment by moment, into a detailed calendar, all in the name of staying focused.)Finally, when the time comes to get into deep work, eliminate all your distractions. Signal that you’re busy, make sure you’re unavailable in Slack and on the shared calendar, and put your phone on “do not disturb.” Don’t check emails, don’t talk to anyone, don’t look at your devices for anything but work, and commit to only working on your demanding task in the time you allotted for it.The most important element is doing this mindfully and going into your deep work sessions aware that your goal is to accomplish something demanding with no distractions. Emails, notifications, chitchat, and other worries and interruptions are commonplace and pull you away from the task at hand, so purposely cutting them off to get something done will be difficult, but it can turn into a habit, especially once it starts yielding the dual result of accomplishment and fulfillment.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe deep work hackAll of that sounds great in theory, but when you find yourself staring down the hour-and-a-half block you scheduled out, you may not know what to do or where to start. This is where you need the Pomodoro method, a famous productivity technique that asks you to work, uninterrupted, for 25 minutes, take a five-minute break, and repeat the cycle about four times before getting a larger break. You can modify those time blocks a bit to suit your needs, but 25 on and five off are the standard. When you use this approach, deep work starts to come naturally in those working blocks because you know you're getting a reprieve at the end. Deep work is described as a period when work seems to flow smoothly and you barely notice time going by, so 25 minutes may not be quite enough for you (depending on the task at hand), but you can figure it out as you get started incorporating these methods. The most important thing is to be distraction-free. The second most important thing is to remember that breaks are actually a key part of staying productive, so don't skip them altogether. The easiest way to make use of this time-tested technique is, of course, by app. My favorite is FocusPomo, which blocks all your distracting apps while you use it and generates cute, unobtrusive cartoon tomatoes to reward you for finishing work blocks. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

There's WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Signal, Telegram, and iMessage (if you're on iPhone), and that's just the dedicated chat apps. You might have to keep up with new messages on Instagram, TikTok, Threads, even Spotify. If I install one more app with a messaging feature, I'm going off the grid. As it happens, another non-chat app is joining this list. On Tuesday, Zillow—yes, Zillow—announced its app will also now support messaging. Starting today, you can send people messages in the app you use to look at houses you will most likely never actually buy. We live in interesting times, indeed. Of course, Zillow's goal here isn't to become the next WhatsApp. In fact, you can only choose to chat with one other person on Zillow—at least, that's the case for now. The idea of Zillow messaging is strictly to chat about listings you find through the app, without needing to leave Zillow to do so. The goal for most app developers is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, so there's a cynical case to make here for Zillow trapping its users within the app. If you don't move to another chat app to talk about a listing, you're more likely to interact with additional houses on the app. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut I actually see the logic here: If you're in a housing market with a lot of listings, you're probably firing off a number of them every day to interested parties—namely, whoever you're buying the house with. Keeping those conversations in the same app as those listings could be a smart way to keep track of all those houses, instead of the usual routine of \"wait, which house was that? I can't find the text you sent me.\" And the fact that Zillow is limiting this experience to one chat partner at this time means you're not going to be DMing a number of people about houses in your area. This does seem designed for people who are trying to buy a house together to do so with a bit more convenience.How to try Zillow messagingThis feature is live as of this article. To get started, open Zillow on your smartphone or in your web browser. On the app, tap \"Inbox;\" on the web, click your profile in the top-right, then choose \"Inbox.\"  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to start a chat, you need to invite the other person to join you. To do so, choose \"Invite now,\" which will pull up a pop-up about the feature.

Starting today, new users in California will have to scan their faces while setting up their accounts to ensure that they're both real and that they match their profile photos. Called Face Check, the new mandatory feature is the first step in a new initiative from Tinder's parent company Match Group, which says the goal is to help reduce \"spam, scam attempts, or [bots] operating automated fake profiles.\" When signing up, users will need to complete a \"liveness check,\" during which they'll take a video selfie from various angles. After that, the app will compare the selfie to profile pictures also uploaded during setup, and if it determines that they match, the user will get a \"Photo Verified badge\" and they'll be able to finish making their account. Tinder also says the system can determine if a picture has been used across multiple accounts to help prevent impersonation.While Face Check is new to the United States, it's already been launched abroad in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and \"several countries across Southeast Asia.\" According to Tinder, \"when coupled with other recent safety initiatives,\" Face Check has led to an over 60% decrease in users exposed to \"bad actors,\" and an over 40% decrease in reports of bad actors.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFace Check's debut also coincides with the rise of AI image generators, and while the company's announcement post doesn't explicitly call out AI, it's not hard to see how it could prove handy against bots using generated photos to pretend to be someone who doesn't even exist. Traditional catfishing methods, such as using stock photos, can be detected with diligent reverse image searching, but AI's ability to quickly create novel, believable, and specifically tailored results has made it harder than ever to know whether you're speaking to a genuine human online.At the same time, as other apps begin to collect personal information like government IDs, there is a privacy concern. Tinder says that Face Check only uses your video selfie to complete the verification process, and deletes it shortly after review, although it does generate a \"non-reversible, encrypted face map\" that is stored to \"help verify new photos, detect fraud, and prevent duplicate accounts.\"As someone who met my husband on Twitter (RIP), I'll leave it up to you whether that's worth it. Have you tried just getting real good at posting instead?For now, though, you might have to wait a bit until Face Check actually makes its way to you. First, Tinder is not forcing existing accounts to use Face Check, which is why I assume it's using a badge to indicate the accounts that have gone through Face Check, even though it's mandatory during setup. Second, Face Check is rolling out slowly. Tinder says that it will come to additional states \"in the coming months,\" although the company did not provide an exact timeline.As for other apps, Match Group (which also owns OKCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, among others) says it will extend Face Check to additional platforms in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

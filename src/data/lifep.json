They're also often low quality, AI-generated, misinformation, or some combination of the bunch, and may have a negative impact on our attention spans and mental health. In short, they're just not that good for us. It's bad enough for grown adults to control their scrolling habits, but it's another thing entirely for children, which poses quite the a challenge.It's easy enough to ban short-form video apps entirely, like TikTok. But what about apps that have short-form content as just one pillar of the overall package? Take YouTube: You might not mind your child having limited access to the app or site to watch long-form content you approve of, but having Shorts always in the way throws a wrench in that system. Any type of short-form video feed would be an issue here, but YouTube Shorts is particularly egregious, allowing kids to watch some truly horrific content, often generated by AI. Choosing whether your kids watch YouTube ShortsLuckily, YouTube finally appears to be giving parents some control here. As spotted by TechCrunch, YouTube announced updates to its parental controls on Wednesday. While there are a few changes on the way, the headline for me concerns Shorts. Not only will YouTube let parents choose a timer for how often their kids can watch Shorts, they can choose to set the timer to zero—effectively blocking Shorts for their kids' and teens' accounts. \nThis should be welcome news to any parents struggling to limit the short-form video content their kids are watching. You can let them watch other types of videos on YouTube Kids, or even standard YouTube if its a teen account, without worrying about them going down short-form video rabbit holes for hours. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe control here can be even more granular than an outright ban, too. Since you're always in control of the timer, YouTube says you can customize timers based on the scenario: You could set the Shorts timer to zero during homework time, then offer 30 minutes of scrolling after dinner. You could bump that to 60 minutes on weekends, or when in the car. If your child is under a supervised account, you'll also be able to control both custom Bedtime and \"Take a Break\" reminders. This is not the first time YouTube has offered users more control over Shorts. Last week, the company rolled out a new search filter that lets you choose to only see long-form videos in any given result, and since October, you've been able to limit the number of shorts you can watch in a day. YouTube, and parent company Google, are also expanding parental controls and enhancing protections for kids and teens. YouTube now uses AI to guess your age, and, if it believes you're under 18, will add restrictions to your account. Google also gives parents more control over supervised accounts: Previously, teens could choose to remove supervision after turning 13, but now, they need their parents to sign off on it too.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This update addresses 114 vulnerabilities in total, including three zero-days (bugs that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before an official fix is available from the developer). As reported by BleepingComputer, security flaws were found across the following categories: 57 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, three security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 22 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, 22 information disclosure vulnerabilities, two denial of service vulnerabilities, and five spoofing vulnerabilities. Six of the remote code execution vulnerabilities and two of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" Your machine should receive security updates automatically when Patch Tuesday drops, which is around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of the month. You can check to confirm by going to Start > Settings > Windows Update and selecting Check for Windows updates\nThree zero-days patched in JanuaryOne of the three zero-days fixed this month has been actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, labeled CVE-2026-20805, is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Desktop Windows Manager that allows attackers access to memory addresses from a remote ALPC port. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) have been credited with identifying this bug. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other two zero-days have been publicly disclosed. CVE-2026-21265 is a security bypass feature vulnerability that allows threat actors to bypass Secure Boot on systems that have not updated certificates issued in 2011 and nearing expiration. CVE-2023-31096 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in third-party Agere Soft Modem drivers that ship with supported Windows operating systems installed. Microsoft has removed these drivers from Windows. Microsoft released other non-security updates today, as well as additional patches for Microsoft Edge and Mariner vulnerabilities earlier this month.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This marks the device's lowest price ever, according to price-tracking tools. With high praise from Lifehacker own review and an outstanding rating on PCMag, the powerful, future-proof S25 Ultra is a top choice for Android users.\nThe model on sale includes 512GB storage and a large 6.9-inch AMOLED display with thinner bezels, an updated anti-glare coating, and a 120Hz refresh rate. Softened corners make it more ergonomic to hold, and it’s more durable than its predecessors thanks to an IP68 rating, upgraded Gorilla Armor glass, and a stronger titanium frame.Powering the phone is the speedy Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which runs the device’s AI features, games, and any other multitasking needs smoothly. The built-in S Pen is still there, tucked into the phone’s body, but it no longer includes Bluetooth functions, so it can’t be used as a remote camera button or slideshow controller, unfortunately. The SnapDragon 8 Elite also improves the phone's battery life; the 5,000 mAh-capacity battery lasts over 14 hours with the screen on constant brightness and location sharing on.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou’ll get a full suite of Galaxy AI tools, like converting spoken speech to text, drawing assist, and the digital assistant Google Gemini. While these generational changes are more about refinements than full-on transformation, a $300 discount makes this a great excuse to swap out your own phone with an upgraded Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It adds little missing features that I really like on the Mac, like a Spotlight Search alternative, auto dark mode, screen awake, on-screen OCR (which lets you pull text from images), and more.But the reverse is also true. When I'm on MacOS, I start to miss the little features and commands that I've been used to Windows having for decades now (I started using Windows in school, but was only exposed to macOS when I was in college).It's the little things, like not being able to cut and paste files in Finder. And why must I accidentally open the Music app every time I press the play button? This is just the beginning.\nEnter Supercharge, a utility from prolific indie developer Sindre Sorhus. Think of it not as a single app, but as a Swiss army knife for your menu bar—a collection of micro-utilities designed to patch the specific usability holes that Apple has left open, many of which Microsoft has already plugged. The app offers an unlimited free trial (with a prompt to upgrade every 12 hours), or you can buy it outright for $18. It's also available as part of a Setapp subscription. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Supercharge\n                    \n    \nThe best Supercharge tweaks that you should enableThe Supercharge app works in two ways. The first is by giving you a set-and-forget settings menu. Secondly, it adds a menu bar app where you can quickly access small features on the fly.The tweaks part, to me, is a lot more interesting. Once the app is installed, open the menu bar app and go to Settings. Go to the Tweaks tab and take some time to customize your Mac's behavior.Make Finder work more like Windows File Explorer\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe Finder is where Supercharge shines, fixing legacy behaviors that have frustrated Windows switchers for years. The first thing I enabled was the \"Cut and Paste\" functionality. Finally, you can use Cmd+X to cut a file and Cmd+V to move it, eliminating the awkward Cmd+C followed by Cmd+Option+V dance required by default.Beyond moving files, the app allows you to enable the Option+N shortcut to instantly create a new text file in your current folder—another Windows muscle memory I've had for decades. Additional tweaks include toggling the Enter key to open a file instead of renaming it, and an option to show hidden files by default.Mission Control featuresApple's Mission Control provides a bird's-eye view of all your windows, but it's hardly interactive. Supercharge changes that by adding window management buttons directly to the overlay. You can now add dedicated Close, Minimize, and Quit buttons for every window inside Mission Control, helping you clear cluttered app windows in seconds, and in a fairly visual way.Dock enhancementsSupercharge also brings much-needed flexibility to the Dock, making it more like the taskbar on Windows or Linux. Enable the Click-to-Hide feature, and you can minimize or hide an app simply by clicking on the app icon. My favorite, though, is the option to open folders directly in the Finder from the Dock. You can also set Supercharge to add spacers to the Dock, and quit apps using the middle-click mouse button.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Apple Music app fixPerhaps the most useful fix in the entire suite is the ability to stop Apple Music from launching automatically. This feature stops the app from popping up when you press Play on your keyboard or Bluetooth headphones. If you are a dedicated Spotify user or simply dislike it when your headphones accidentally wake up Apple Music, this feature alone makes a Supercharge installation worth it.Other useful featuresThe Supercharge app includes several other quality-of-life improvements. The Notification Nuke feature allows you to set a global hotkey to instantly clear all notifications from Notification Center, acting as a panic button for focus. To prevent accidents, you can also enable Accidental Quit Prevention, which requires a double-press or a Shift + Cmd + Q combo to actually quit an application.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe second part of the equation here is the menu bar app. Here, you can add small missing features that usually require downloading separate apps. There are more than two dozen options. Go to Settings > General > Show Menu Items to see the whole list.Here, you can add options to quickly capture and copy any text from an image (or translate it). There are one-click options for hiding all windows, showing the desktop, quitting all apps except the current one, clearing all notifications, and more. There's also a simple Keep Awake feature that will keep your Mac active even when the screen is off. And there's also a simple default browser switcher built-in, though I prefer using Sindre's dedicated Default Browser app.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.If you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look. \n\n    \n            \n            There are plenty of categories to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.The home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to sign up for a MediaWiki account if you want to be able to contribute to the site too.Hover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.Click through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Each movie comes with a cast list.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.Obviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.Free movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

I discovered the issue myself just after 9:30 a.m. ET. I was scrolling on my feed, when all of a sudden, new posts wouldn't load, and I was greeted by an option to refresh. When I did, the site reloaded, but now without any posts—only the futile option to try reloading again.You can see a steep spike in user reports on Downdetector (which, for full disclosure, is owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis). At the time of writing, roughly 25,000 users had reported issues with X, I among them. There are a number of potential reasons why X won't load this morning, but it doesn't appear to be a larger issue with a cloud hosting service. Anytime a major website like X goes down, it harkens back to global outages, stemming from issues with cloud hosting services like AWS and Cloudflare. However, a quick check on Downdetector shows me that few other sites and services are having massive outage reports at the moment. That could change, but as of this article, it seems like X's issues are their own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nX will no doubt get things back up and running soon.

Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great. Microsoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless. Microsoft's \"Handoff\" moment is coming   As spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps. \nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board. As Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.  It's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability. How to enable Resume on WindowsThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.What is the RICE method of prioritization?RICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for: Reach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impactImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctlyConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factorsEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources requiredA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started. \nHow and when to use RICEI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math. Start by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit. Next, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

We are giving you a $5 credit towards your next month of service that can be redeemed after Jan 16 when paying with a credit card online. This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us. If you’re still having trouble connecting, please restart your device (power down and power back on).The amount may be smaller, but it does seem to be a bit more convenient to claim, since it sounds like you can apply it while paying your bill (although I can't make any promises for people using auto pay). Like Verizon's offer, it also doesn't seem to be discriminating between those affected by the outage and those who weren't, as noted by a user on Reddit.\nSome comments from other Visible subscribers on Reddit did point out that they had yet to receive the text, although I'm assuming that's due to a slow rollout more than anything else, as textless users who reached out to customer service were able to confirm they were offered the $5 credit as well. I've reached out to Visible to confirm if the $5 credit applies to everyone, and will update this post when I hear back (I also asked if it would be applied to automatic payments).As for why the payment is so much smaller, it's probably due to the difference in cost between Verizon and Visible. Verizon said it based its $20 payout on the price for \"multiple days of service,\" and frankly, those same days cost much less on Visible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile Visible uses the same network as Verizon, it sets itself apart by giving its users lower priority while connecting, which lets it offer unlimited plans starting at $20/month. Prices range to $33/month, but essentially, $5 goes a lot further on the low cost network, meaning it represents a similar value to $20 for a proper Verizon plan.Whether that's a fair price for an unexpected day of spotty connectivity, I'll leave up to you.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you enter your debit or credit card into one of these fake card readers, your data is stored for later download or transmitted wirelessly in real time to a device controlled by scammers, who will use the information to steal from your accounts. Unfortunately, online shoppers aren't immune from this scheme. Web skimming is a type of cyberattack that uses malicious code to steal card data during checkout, and researchers have identified an ongoing campaign targeting major payment providers and, by extension, consumers. Online credit card skimmingWeb skimming attacks, broadly referred to as \"Magecart\" campaigns, are initiated when malicious JavaScript is injected into e-commerce websites and payment portals. When a checkout page loads, the skimmer replaces it with a spoofed form that collects card numbers, expiry dates, card verification codes, and billing or shipping addresses—everything threat actors need to turn around and use your card for fraudulent purchases. \nThe fake payment forms use legitimate-looking branding and styling to minimize suspicion. Once payment details are transmitted to the attacker, the user gets an error message and is redirected to the real checkout page, a flow designed to make you believe that you've simply entered your information incorrectly. Web skimmers are typically designed to avoid detection and may even self-destruct, making them difficult to identify even for site admins. They also utilize bulletproof hosting, which shields cyber actors from takedown requests and law enforcement action. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect your payment cardUnfortunately, consumers can't do much about the presence of web skimmers, but they can play defense against them. Red flags of an online shopping scam are also red flags for skimming—for example, deals and discounts that are too good to be true are indicators of a possible fraudulent vendor or malicious site, where you may be more likely to have your card details stolen. Shopping with reputable vendors will reduce (though not entirely eliminate) the risk. You should also be vigilant about any unusual steps during checkout, such as redirects or error messages, and abandon any suspicious transactions. If you suspect that your payment details may have been stolen, keep an eye on your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized activity, and enable transaction alerts for real-time updates. Remember that credit cards offer more security protections than debit cards. You could also use virtual cards for online purchases, which allows you to keep your actual card details private and protect you from further fraud. (Note, however, that virtual cards have some drawbacks. For example, you may lose some protections offered by your primary card provider and have a tougher time obtaining refunds.)\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching. YouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one. If you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search. \nHow to remove YouTube Shorts from searchTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.Unfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.Other changes to YouTube filtersIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.    Finally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

For example, that seemingly endless time spent shivering in the shower while you wait for the water to heat up. Or that painful moment when you go to wash your hands and water that feels like it’s being pumped directly from the Arctic splashes you.Waiting for the water to heat up is an age-old problem caused by simple laws of physics: Your water heater is far away from the tap or shower head, and it takes time to flush out the cold water in the pipes. But there are ways to speed up your hot water delivery. The easiest is to install a tankless water heater, but those can cost thousands of dollars to install, and require a lot of space your house may not have. If you want to speed up your hot water without taking on that much of an expense, you have a few more affordable choices.Install a recirculating pumpOne reason it takes a while for hot water to arrive is time: When you turn off the faucet, the hot water sitting in the pipes starts to cool off. The next time you turn on the tap, that cooled water has to be pushed out of the hot water pipes before the hot water can arrive.\nTo solve this, you can have a recirculating pump installed at a cost typically under $1,000. These pumps are installed on your existing water heater, and work by continuously circulating the water in the pipes so it never sits there, cooling off. Because it’s installed at the water heater, it speeds up hot water to your appliances, as well, including washing machines and dishwashers, which can help them operate more efficiently.Point-of-use tankless heatersWhile a whole-house tankless water heater can be a big and expensive project, what’s known as a “point-of-use” tankless water heater can be a more manageable and affordable solution. These are small enough to install under a sink, and are designed to provide hot water on demand just at that point of use. The heaters themselves typically run a few hundred bucks, with installation typically running less than $1,000. Because of their small size, it’s feasible to install one of these yourself if you’re comfortable with plumbing and electrical work, but they can require careful calibration, so hiring a professional plumber is probably your best move.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInsulateSince part of the problem with slow hot water is heat loss as the water sits in the pipes, you can sometimes improve the situation just by insulating your hot water pipes thoroughly. This is definitely a DIY job if you can identify and access your hot water pipes, and it’s not a terribly expensive job to hire out, costing as little as $350 on average. It’s just a matter of wrapping the pipes with insulating cuffs, then taping everything off so it’s sealed up nicely. This can help keep water hot while it sits, so the next time you turn on the faucet, you get the hot water you expect.Adjust restrictorsCold water has to drain out of your pipes for the hot water to hit your faucet or showerhead, so one possible way to speed things up is to remove any flow regulators/restrictors that have been installed. These simple devices do exactly what it sounds like: They restrict the flow of water, conserving energy and water and keeping your utility bills lower. But since they restrict flow, they also mean it can take longer for cold water to drain off and hot water to arrive, so removing or adjusting them can reduce the time it takes for that hot water to get to you.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

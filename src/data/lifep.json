The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing. The issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Take a Message is a recently introduced feature for the Phone app that activates when the recipient is not available to answer (or declines the incoming call). The caller hears the following: “The person you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” If you, as the recipient, tap the Take a message notification on your device, you can see a transcript of the audio in real time and hit Answer if you want to pick up. (Take a Message will also detect spam calls and mark them with a warning.)A few users have reported that Take a Message has activated and allowed the caller to hear the recipient's background audio as they are leaving a message. It's important to note that this is not a widespread issue, and most of the reports come from people with older Pixel devices that no longer get OS updates. According to 9to5Google, Google is investigating the reports. \nAgain, while this doesn't seem to be a bug affecting most Pixel users, you can disable Take a Message if you are concerned about privacy, especially with unknown callers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to disable Take a Message on your PixelOpen the Phone app on your device and tap the icon in the top-left corner to open Settings.

For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations.

JustTheBrowser is a free and open source tool from developer and tech blogger Corbin Davenport that removes AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Basically, you can run this once and never think about these features again.To get started, head to the JustTheBrowser homepage. There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.Either way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing. On macOS, I needed to follow a few instructions to enable a configuration policy in the Settings app, something that only took a couple of clicks. After that, Chrome was free of any and all references to AI.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nA number of other features were also gone, including those annoying prompts to switch my default browser.The way this works is kind of interesting: it uses features intended for large organizations. Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.It's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:Remove AI from results\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.Return Google search to 10 blue linksGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search. \nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.Search a particular domainIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.Restrict results to one websiteIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.Look for specific file formatsWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.Google has easily accessible filters If you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse Google's Advanced Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.Try reverse image searchGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.Use content blockers to hide unwanted resultsIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.Set your favorite websites as preferred sourcesIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites.

The bot generates a playlist for you based on your request.\n                                            These playlists take your entire Spotify listening history into account, as well.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Last month, Spotify announced \"Prompted Playlist,\" a new feature the company claimed let users \"steer the algorithm.\" This was a bold—if not vague—claim, to be sure, but it was backed by everyone's favorite tech trend of the last three years: AI. The pitch was that Spotify would let subscribers use the company's AI models to better control their listening experience, so long as they lived in the country of New Zealand. That's a very small slice of Spotify's very large user base. Luckily for those of us in the United States and Canada, Prompted Playlist is expanding to our side of North America. Spotify announced the move today, Jan. 21: Now, Premium subscribers in any of these three countries can access the feature, if they want to hand over the playlist reigns to Spotify's machine learning models.Prompted Playlist is Spotify's AI-powered tool that lets you use natural language to create custom playlists. The idea is, rather than look for songs to add to a playlist, you tell Spotify's AI what you're in the mood to listen to, and it adds songs automatically for you. That can include genres and existing songs, but also ideas, deeper descriptions, and, for lack of a better word, vibes. \nTo understand what I mean, here are some of the suggested prompts Spotify suggests you try: \"Make me a playlist of songs I’ve saved to my Library (playlists or Liked Songs) that I either haven’t played yet or have only listened to once. The goal is to round up those songs I found, saved, and then totally forgot to revisit. Give me a chance to finally hear what I’ve been missing.\"\"What are the first tracks I ever listened to on Spotify? Order them by the very first track I ever streamed - with date and time - and keep going.\"\"Knowing what I listen to today, make me a playlist of songs from 2016 that match my current taste, mixing the biggest tracks from that year with songs that feel timeless now.\"\"Make me a playlist to help me learn Spanish, with clear vocals and easy-to-follow lyrics. Mix popular Spanish-language songs with slower tracks that make it easier to catch the words, and include music that reflects different Spanish-speaking cultures to keep it engaging.\"Spotify says that Prompted Playlist takes your existing listening history into account as well. While you and a friend might give Spotify's AI the same prompt, in theory, you should each receive different playlists, since the AI will make adjustments based on the music you like and don't like. You also don't have to wonder why the AI put a specific song in the playlist: Each track starts with a \"quick one-liner\" that explains why Spotify chose it in the first place. I could see that being either insightful, or extremely annoying.The thing is, Spotify has rolled out a feature like this before, appropriately dubbed \"AI Playlist.\" Lifehacker's David Nield covered it in September of 2024, and catching up on that feature, it sounds pretty similar to Prompted Playlist. AI Playlist isn't actually going away now that Prompted Playlist is here: Spotify tells me that these are two separate features, and that the major differences are that Prompted Playlist factors in your entire Spotify listening history, going back to your first song, as well as real-time information about \"trends, charts, culture, and history\" in the industry today. You can also schedule playlists if you like, so the mix refreshes every day or week, something you can't do with AI Playlist.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFrom my seat, it also seems like Prompted Playlist is designed to handle more complex prompts, as well. While the company advertised AI Playlist as a way to build playlists from prompts like \"upbeat pop music for my road trip,\" the company's suggested Prompted Playlist prompts are much more intricate, and include multiple levels of instruction for the AI. Perhaps part of that is the result of improvements in the technology over the past year and half.  How to try Spotify's Prompted PlaylistPrompted Playlist is launching as a Premium-only feature, so if you don't pay for Spotify, you unfortunately can't access it. If you do have a Premium account, you'll need to head to Spotify, tap \"Create,\" then choose \"Prompted Playlist.\"As explained above, from here, you can describe what kind of playlist you want the tool to make. From here, you'll be able to set how often it refreshes (if it refreshes at all). If you're not happy with the results, you can choose \"Edit Prompt\" to adjust it. You can share the playlist with friends, but know that Spotify will adjust the playlist to match their listening histories instead. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The campaign, known as GhostPoster, was identified by Koi Security in December and included 17 Firefox add-ons designed to monitor users' browsing activity. Threat actors planted malicious JavaScript code in the extension's PNG logo, which served as a malware loader to retrieve the main payload from a remote server. Researchers at LayerX have found an additional 17 malicious extensions across multiple browsers that have collectively been installed more than 840,000 times. Ongoing GhostPoster malware campaignAccording to the report from LayerX, GhostPoster initially targeted Microsoft Edge and then expanded to Chrome and Firefox. The malicious add-ons may have been active as early as 2020 and include the following: \nGoogle Translate in Right Click Translate Selected Text with GoogleAds Block UltimateFloating Player – PiP Mode Convert Everything Youtube Download One Key Translate AdBlocker Save Image to Pinterest on Right ClickInstagram Downloader RSS Feed Cool Cursor Full Page Screenshot Amazon Price History Color Enhancer Translate Selected Text with Right ClickPage Screenshot Clipper\"Google Translate in Right Click\" alone had 522,398 installs. The next most popular add-on was \"Translate Selected Text with Google\" with 159,645 installs. Researchers also found a more sophisticated variant of the campaign in \"Instagram Downloader,\" which had 3,822 installs. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGhostPoster malware has built-in safeguards to prevent detection—for example, activation is delayed by 48 hours, and it only communicates with remote attack servers under certain conditions. Once installed, though, extensions that are part of GhostPoster have the ability to hijack affiliate traffic (and redirect commissions to attackers), strip and inject HTTP headers to weaken security, bypass CAPTCHA, and inject iframes and scripts for click fraud and user tracking. The only sort-of good news is that the malware doesn't harvest credentials or engage in phishing. While the malicious extensions are no longer available to add in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, users who have them installed should remove them immediately, as they remain active until explicitly deleted. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Microsoft's flagship work suite, which includes tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook, is currently experiencing issues impacting users. It's not yet clear exactly why these problems are occurring, but according to Downdetector (owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis) thousands of users are reporting issues.There are any number of causes that could trigger a widespread outage like this, and in all likelihood, Microsoft will have the issue isolated and fixed soon—especially considering how many companies and users rely on Microsoft 365 to function. But it does follow a number of high-profile outages this week. Yesterday, Yahoo! and AOL were both down. Last week, X experienced an outage, as did Verizon—quite famously, I might add. And this morning, Instagram was also down.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut joining that list as well is none other than Microsoft itself. These services were all down yesterday, too, making this the second day in a row. Again, it's not clear why Microsoft is experiencing these issues, but while we wait for a fix, there's not much you can do on your end. If your Microsoft apps are acting up, you can try to work with any of the offline tools you have access to. If you have other means of communication other than Teams, run with that. There's nothing short of Microsoft issuing a patch on its end that will bring back online functionality here.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        A workout habit has a way of building momentum: Once you’re doing something, anything, it’s easy to build on that. Video workouts are a simple way to get started, but if you're having trouble following along, I'm here to help. Below are some ways to make common exercises more accessible, and what to do if you can't get through a whole video yet.If you can’t squatLots of “easy” bodyweight programs ask you to perform a squatting motion without any added weight. But if that’s already more than you can do, try one of these instead: Sit in a chair, and stand back up. Lean your back against a wall and slide down until you’re in a sitting position (this is called a wall squat). Hold onto a countertop or the back of a chair while you do a squat. For any of these, it’s okay to squat as low as you can, even if that’s not all the way to parallel. You can work on going lower over time. \nIf you can’t do pushupsPushups are another move you’ll find in simple beginner workouts, but not everyone can do a pushup on their first day. Pushups get easier the higher your hands are, and harder the higher your feet are. So for the easiest beginner version, put your hands on a wall around shoulder height. Lean into the wall, then push yourself back to a standing position. Once those become easy, choose a lower surface, like a table or countertop. Then move to a chair, and so on. This progression is arguably better than doing pushups on your knees, because no matter which level you’re on, you are practicing holding your entire body straight in a plank position. If you aren’t ready to pick up weightsDumbbells come in all sizes—and fortunately for beginners, the smallest ones are also the cheapest. If your gym doesn’t have dumbbells small enough, any store with a sporting goods section will likely have some one- and two-pound dumbbells you can pick up and add to your gym bag. But if you’re not even ready for dumbbells, that’s okay. A half-liter water bottle weighs about a pound. Same with a can of soup. Larger water bottles, wine bottles, and milk jugs can take you up a bit further in weight; we did the math for you here. You can also hold books, roller skates, or tote bags full of literally anything. (Two water bottles in a grocery bag? That’s a two-pound weight.)Need to start even lighter? It’s okay to do weight workouts using literally nothing. Make your hands into fists and go through the motions. If you’re following a video that does a million reps of bicep curls or tricep extensions, your arms will get tired even if they’re empty. Just move up to the water bottles as soon as you’re ready. If you can't keep up with the pace of the videoWith these substitutions, you may feel ready to start following along with beginner level workout videos. But what if you can’t handle exactly what’s on the screen? Remember, your goal should be to do a workout at your current level of fitness, not to complete a certain number of reps that you theoretically could do if you were in better shape. So if the video asks for 30 seconds of pushups but you can only manage a few reps, do as many as you can and rest for the remainder of the time. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt’s fine to bounce from video to video until you find something at your level. Keep an eye out for one that seems like fun but is just out of your reach. Do it anyway, modifying it or resting as needed, and then bookmark it and come back to it next week. Chances are good you’ll be able to keep up a little bit better—and if you keep coming back to that same workout week after week, you’ll eventually master it. Consistency breeds momentum. If cycling workouts are too hardLet’s say you want to do a workout from a Peloton-like cycling instructor. You’ve got your bike, you can pedal, but pretty quickly you’re out of breath and feel like you can’t keep going.These workouts are easy to adjust: All you have to do is pay attention to the instructor’s voice and facial expressions and ignore any specific numbers. It doesn’t matter if she’s asking you for a “20” or a “50.” If the instructor looks and talks like she’s on an easy bike ride, adjust your resistance so you are on an easy bike ride. If she looks like she’s working hard but not dying, adjust your resistance so you are working hard but not dying.If you can’t decide where to startStart literally anywhere. There isn’t a wrong answer. Maybe you start doing cardio dance videos, but it turns out you hate dancing. Well, you’re already moving your body a couple times a week, so you can swap out the dancing for something else. Or maybe you start doing pushups every day, but after a while your wrists are aching. You can choose to address that problem and continue your pushups, or you can look back on how far you’ve come, congratulate yourself, and pick a different thing to try for the next chapter of your fitness journey. After all, you’ve already started, so why not keep going? \n            ",

I love stock Android, and I'm always running the latest Android beta, making Pixel basically my only choice. But there are times when I get jealous looking at all the extra tools that Samsung provides on its Galaxy phones, Edge Panel being the big one. With Edge Panel, you can swipe in from the edge of your phone and a hidden drawer reveals itself, filled with apps, system actions, and shortcuts. Given how barebones Pixel Launcher is, I've always wanted something like this. Then I found the Panels app by Fossor Coding (not to be confused with the ill-fated wallpaper app by MKBHD).In some ways, Panels is even better than Edge Panels on Samsung. It lets you use custom icon packs, there's a quick search shortcut, and you can even open floating widgets. Plus, because it's customizable, you can move the trigger point to the bottom edge of your phone instead of the side (incredibly handy for large phones), and you can add multiple columns (up to a ridiculous seven column layout). And while you can pay for Panels, all of that basic functionality is included for free.How to customize the Panels app for AndroidFirst, install the app and give it permission to display over other apps; this makes sure that the Panels launcher can work when you're using any app.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNext, tap on the View button and customize the panel. The free version limits you to 3 columns and 9 rows, which seems like plenty to me. You can upgrade to the full version to remove this limit (which is quite cheap, at just $1.50). From the Trigger section, you can customize the trigger area. If you have a larger phone, I highly recommend bringing down the trigger area towards the bottom of the screen.Now, let's customize the Panels launcher itself. Swipe in from your trigger area and hold for a second to bring up the sidebar panel. By default, you'll see some apps here already. Tap and hold on an empty area to start adding more apps.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nYou can choose to add any of the following items:Applications: Choose any installed app. Add your most frequently used apps here.Shortcuts: Launch actions from inside any supported apps. For example, you can create a shortcut for adding a new task in TickTick, or messaging someone on WhatsApp.App pair: Create shortcuts for launching two apps side-by-side, made even more useful after Android 16's latest 90:10 split screen update.Accessibility: Add shortcuts for system-level options like Home, Back, Notifications, Screenshot, and more.System preferences: Quick access to frequently used settings like media volume, cellular data, airplane mode, Wi-Fi, and a lot more.Website: You can add any website as a quick shortcut here.Floating widget: This is a hidden gem. You can add widgets that open in a floating window above everything else. You can trigger widgets for news, weather, or sports updates. They can hover over everything else for a few seconds, before you dismiss them out of the way.Folder: If you have too many quick app options, organize them in folders instead.Contact: Add any contact here as an icon. Press and hold to quickly call, message, or email them.Quick Search: Another useful hack. The Quick Search panel brings up a fast search for all installed apps.Go over each option and choose what you'd like to add to your sidebar launcher. Me, I'm a simple man, so my focus is mostly on my most frequently used apps, shortcuts for common actions, and quick access to some system level functionality.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOne swipe gesture: Lastly, here's a pro tip. While you can open apps in Panels by swiping, lifting your thumb, and selecting, you can also do it without taking your thumb off the screen.Once you swipe in from the edge and the Panels sidebar opens up, don't let go. You can keep moving your thumb to highlight any app or shortcut (the icon that's in focus will get bigger). Then simply let go over your selection to launch it. Overall, Panels is a pretty robust app. Once you have your personalized setup, you can launch apps, shortcuts, or widgets, with just a swipe, no matter which app you're using.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

NexShield pitched itself as a privacy-focused ad blocker from the developer of well-established and highly trusted uBlock Origin. However, as security firm Huntress found, the extension initiates a variation of the ClickFix attack that has been dubbed \"CrashFix\"—a reference to the browser crash that precedes the fake security warning and malicious command prompt. How NexShield's 'CrashFix' attacks your deviceAs BleepingComputer describes, the NexShield extension creates a denial-of-service (DoS) loop that exhausts your device's memory, ultimately freezing Chrome or Edge and causing it to crash. When the browser restarts, the extension displays a pop-up with a \"Run Scan\" button to identify \"potential security threats that may compromise your browsing data,\" leading users to believe that the crash resulted from a security issue. \nIf you follow through, you'll see another fake window with instructions for executing commands in the Windows command prompt. This is the ClickFix attack: a form of social engineering that relies on fake error messages, CAPTCHAs, and command prompts to trick users into deploying malware onto their own devices. In this case, the extension copies a command to the clipboard, and if users enter the keystrokes in the fake pop-up, downloads and executes a malicious script. After a 60-minute delay to avoid detection, NexShield delivers the payload that can run commands, fingerprint systems, and elevate privileges. Note that as of this writing, NexShield has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. How to protect your system from malwareIf you've installed NexShield, you should uninstall it and perform a full system cleanup to clear its payloads from your device. (We've got step-by-step guides to removing malware from your Mac and your PC.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs general protection against similar attacks, only install browser extensions from trusted sources. This isn't a guarantee that you'll never encounter a malicious add-on in the Chrome Web Store or in other browsers, as hackers occasionally manage to sneak through the approval process and even get their extensions labeled as trusted or verified. Some extensions are only later injected with malicious code, essentially \"waking up\" their ability to attack. Before installing a new extension, carefully check the creation date, reviews and ratings, and even the name, as malicious add-ons will often impersonate trusted ones (or, as in the case of NexShield, piggyback on legitimate brands like uBlock Origin). Watch for suspicious permissions—if the extension requests access to data or actions that seem excessive or are unrelated to its core function, it might be malware. Finally, never run codes or commands on your machine copied from websites or communication that you don't understand, and always verify instructions with an independent, trusted source. For this specific campaign, Huntress has other indicators of compromise you can look for on your system. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.How age prediction for ChatGPT worksOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.Here's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\nWhat's restricted in the \"safer\" version of ChatGPTThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:Graphic violence or goreViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"Role play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in natureSelf-harm descriptionsContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming The company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.AI isn't always great at age predictionThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.That doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.I don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.That surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\nGoogle can afford to hold off on adsWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.Does this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.The divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Discovery, it seems the company is actually adding new features to its subscription service. Netflix is always adding new shows and movies, which is what most users are looking for in the platform, but that's not all you can expect from your account. In fact, Netflix is now rolling out an interactive experience for its live competition shows, allowing subscribers to cast votes in real-time. Live voting comes to Star SearchNetflix announced the change in a press release on Tuesday, and also revealed the first show to officially run with real-time voting: Star Search. Netflix is bringing back the American Idol precursor tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT), and will allow viewers to choose which contestant they like best alongside \"millions of others.\"  Netflix says it first tested the feature with the show Dinner Time Live with David Chang, and \"learned firsthand how members appreciated the seamless and integrated ways they could participate in the series.\" I don't think you need a focus group to know that people like sharing their opinions on things, but then, I'm not a Netflix exec. \nThe company clarified in its press release that only live events will work with real-time voting. If you watch a show after it airs, you won't be able to cast your vote—which, obviously, makes sense. The show doesn't really need to know who you'd pick as a winner after the winner has already been chosen—though Netflix could always use the extra user data, I'm sure. Star Search is the only show at this time that supports this feature, but Netflix says more real-time voting shows are on the way.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to vote in live Netflix events\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Netflix\n                    \n    \nNetflix says that when you watch a live event, you'll be able to vote when watching on TV or a streaming device. You won't be able to vote if you're watching in a web browser, nor will you be able to vote if you rewind, pause, or tune-in late. When you join a live program, make sure you do so on a smart TV, supported streaming device (such as Apple TV, Fire TV, or Roku), or the Netflix mobile app. If you want to watch in a web browser, you can still vote on your phone at the same time. Netflix will prompt you when it's time to vote. You'll see a 1–5 star rating appear on the screen. Click on tap on the star level you want for each performer. Note that each profile only has one chance to vote per performance, so you can't issue another vote after you cast one—you'll just need to wait until the next performance. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

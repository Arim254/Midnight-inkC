href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Google doesn't have the best track record when it comes to user privacy, but every once in a while, they do something surprising. Back in April, the company <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">began testing end-to-end encrypted email messaging</a> for enterprise users. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/send-gmail-end-to-end-encrypted-emails-in-gmail.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">it officially rolled out the feature</a>. If you have a Google Workspace through work, you should now be able to send emails protected by E2EE, even if you're sending the email outside of Gmail. That should make it possible to send emails that only you, the recipient, and the IT department that manages your account can access. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/texts-may-not-be-secure-says-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">E2EE is essential</a> for anyone who wants to ensure that their communications are totally private. To simplify a complex technology, encrypting something like an email essentially means scrambling all of the code into something completely unrecognizable. In order to unscramble it, you need a \"key.\" In the case of Gmail's E2EE, you have a key, the recipient has a key, and whoever manages your Google Workspace account has a key. The keys to decrypt these emails aren't saved on Google's servers, so even Google should have no way to access your encrypted emails. You can send things like sensitive company information or medical information protected by HIPAA without worrying about prying eyes intercepting the message.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The only bummer here is that E2EE in Gmail is restricted to business accounts at this time. That said, there is a way to send more secure messages over a standard Gmail account—just don't expect E2EE-level protections.</p><h2 id=\"e2ee-for-enterprise-gmail-users\">E2EE for enterprise Gmail users</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg\" alt=\"google e2ee messaging\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759517385.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1759517385.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>In order to send E2EE emails through your enterprise Gmail account, you need to ensure your Workspace admin turns it on. Once they do, you'll need to tell Gmail you want to send your email with E2EE. To do so, open Gmail, and choose \"Compose\" to start a new email. Choose \"Message security,\" then, under \"Additional encryption,\" choose \"Turn on.\" From here, you can compose your message as you normally would, adding your recipients to the list. </p><p>If your recipient is another Google Workspace user, the message will automatically be decrypted when it reaches their inbox. If they aren't a Gmail user, they won't be able to decrypt the email in their client. Instead, they'll receive a link that opens a \"restricted\" version of Gmail. Once they sign in, the message will decrypt, and they'll be able to read and respond to it from this restricted window. Note that IT departments can choose to have all E2EE messages open in restricted Gmail windows, even if the recipients are Google Workspace users.</p><h2 id=\"use-confidential-mode-to-send-secure-messages-for-free\">Use confidential mode to send \"secure\" messages for free</h2><p>If you don't have an enterprise account, there really isn't any way to send E2EE emails through Gmail. For that, you'd need a dedicated encrypted email service, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/proton-unlimited-review-worth-it-vpn-password-manager-secure-email\" target=\"_blank\">like Proton</a>. However, you can add an extra layer of security to your messages before you send them out. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>To do so, start a new email in Gmail, then choose \"Confidential mode\" from the options. This mode blocks recipients from forwarding, copying, printing, or downloading the email. You can also choose to have the message expire after a set period of time—including one day, one week, one month, three months, or five years—as well as password protect the email. If you choose the latter, Gmail will automatically generate a password and send it to the recipients via SMS. </p><p>These added protections are certainly helpful when sending sensitive information over Gmail, but they're imperfect. Again, this is not end-to-end encryption, which means it's possible to intercept and read messages sent this way. More practically, there's nothing stopping users from taking photos of the message with another device—though the same could be said with E2EE messages.</p><p>Unless you have an enterprise account, I'd avoid sending anything too important via Gmail at this time. You're better off using a dedicated E2EE platform, like Signal, WhatsApp, or iMessage.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

It's a signifier of my progression through Club Peloton, a new member recognition program that comes with some solid rewards.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-club-peloton\">What is Club Peloton?</h2><p>Club Peloton is a new ranking system that's meant to reflect a person's efforts and participation with Peloton workouts. Progress is applied retroactively (good news for my 201-day streak) which means I've achieved the rank of Silver III. The ranks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Silver (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Gold (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Champion</p></li><li><p>Legend</p></li></ul><p>Within each of the first three ranks, there are three tiers, and Champion and Legend each stand alone, so there are 11 levels to work through overall. </p><p>Importantly, you can never be demoted on Club Peloton; you can only move up. If you miss a week's worth of workouts while you're in Bronze III, you won't log in to find that you've been bumped down to Bronze II. It's meant to encourage you, not shame you. </p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-earn-points\">How do you earn points?</h2><p>The purpose of this new ranking system is to encourage members, make people try new things, and give recognition and rewards to participants. The methods of earning points demonstrate that. Here's what you can do to rise the ranks:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Earn two points for each day you work out with Peloton, whether using the company's equipment, its app, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strength+.</a></p></li><li><p>Earn points corresponding to your weekly streaks, so three points for a three-week streak, etc. If you work out two weeks in a row, you'll get two points. If you work out 40 weeks in a row, that week is going to end with a 40-point boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for yearly streaks, too. If you work out 52 weeks in a row, you end up with a year-long streak, which earns you double points. Instead of 52 points at the end of that year, you get 104. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for milestones. Milestones can be found on your Peloton profile and include things like taking 10 or 25 of a certain kind of class. When you achieve a milestone in a second activity beyond one you've already got one in, you get a 10% boost. Milestones in three or more give you a 20% boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for participating in programs. Every week you are actively involved in one, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton's FTP program</a>, you get two points. You get one point for every class you complete in your new, AI-generated personal plan and 10 points any time you undertake a Peloton challenge. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for being a team player. Every week, you can earn up to one point each for giving someone a virtual high five during class, taking a live class, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a Team</a>. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-are-the-ranks-calculated\">How are the ranks calculated?</h2><p>Want to know how many points are required to raise your rank? Here's the breakdown:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze is your level if you have zero to 99 points.</p></li><li><p>Silver is for 100 to 1,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Gold covers 2,000 points to 14,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Champion is 15,000 to 29,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Legend is for anyone with over 30,000 points.</p></li></ul><p>Like I said, I'm on a daily streak that stretches almost two-thirds of a year and I'm only in Silver III with just 1,205 points and 795 to go until I hit Gold I. You can tap into your point history to see a breakdown of how you got to where you are. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-all-this\">What is the point of all this?</h2><p>To me, this is awesome, but I am a well-known lover of all manner of streak-based app gimmicks. I will do anything for the pleasure of a digital badge, like go to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">Dunkin' Donuts every day</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/finch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">keep track of my to-do list</a> on an app that forces me to report my progress to a little cartoon bird. Simply put, I find it motivating to compete for something, even if I'm just competing with myself to earn what amounts to little more than pixels. </p><p>Club Peloton, however, amounts to more than that: The company promises that as you work through ranks, you'll unlock \"surprises.\" Future surprises notwithstanding, some of the rewards are already known. You can get early access to new classes or challenges, discounts on apparel or other retail goods, instructor shoutouts during class, and invitations to exclusive in-person events. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

/><p>Summer and fall are the perfect time to prepare for standardized aptitude tests. Prepping through summer will help you be ready for a fall exam, giving you enough time to retake for a higher score it in the spring, if needed, or you can prep through fall and target that spring test. Even if you studied all summer, fall is the ideal time to review and cram down to the last minute. And no matter how you tend to learn, an app can probably help. Here are some of the best ones available on iOS and Android (some are available on a browser, too). </p><h2 id=\"try-khan-academy-if-youre-a-long-term-learner\">Try Khan Academy if you’re a long-term learner</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Khan Academy in browsr\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khan Academy</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Khan Academy</a>, a nonprofit organization and partner of the College Board, has become synonymous with test prep.

For real-deal practice questions, you’ll need to use the desktop version of the site, but the app-based videos are great to take on the go.</p><p>What I like about Khan is that some of the videos and articles are informational. For instance, you can read about calculator policies for the SAT or watch a quick clip that gives you an overview of what the test is and what to expect. Studying material is one thing, but being prepared for the experience is another, and this app is well-rounded there. </p><h2 id=\"use-magooshs-sat-app-for-customized-prep\">Use Magoosh’s SAT app for customized prep</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Magoosh SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_800x453.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_1400x793.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Magoosh</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Magoosh</a> flashcards and practice quizzes go over English and math concepts you should know for your test. Out of all the apps, the Practice & Prep offering is unique because it's dedicated purely to the SAT, but it is customizable. The first time you log in, you're prompted to share when your test is so the app can configure what you should study between now and then. There will be a difference in how you approach it if you have one month or one year to get ready and Magoosh's app knows that.</p><p>Like Khan Academy, this platform gives you information on the test itself, too, offering up a landing page of articles on how to prepare. Beyond that, you get practice questions, videos on the reading and writing sections, and practice tests. While flashcards and study games are useful, practice quizzes are pretty crucial, too, because they give you a better sense of how you'll perform when you're facing down a large volume of content. </p><p>Bear in mind there are <a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">two apps</a> from this company: I like the Practice & Prep, obviously, because it's so customizable and helpful with the quizzes, but there is a separate flashcard app available if you learn better that way and want to double up on the methods you use for studying. </p><h2 id=\"use-varsity-tutors-sat-practice-prep-flashcards-if-you-want-the-most-variety\">Use Varsity Tutors’ SAT: Practice, Prep, Flashcards if you want the most variety</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Varsity Tutors SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_1400x791.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Varsity Tutors</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.varsitytutors.com/sat-mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Varsity Tutors</a> is another well-known name in the studying space, and the company's SAT app is thorough.

The beauty of <a href=\"https://www.brainscape.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Brainscape</a> is that while it's a flashcard app and those are a dime a dozen, it has some legitimacy attached to it because the company works directly with the governing bodies that oversee tests when it creates flashcard decks. AP tests, certification exams, and the SAT are just a few of the options you can study with the knowledge that the questions you're reviewing are actually relevant to the test. Like other apps, Brainscape has an option for reviewing user-generated flashcard decks, too, and that's great—but start with the deck that's been created with the SAT organization itself. </p><p>Crucially, Brainscape uses a version of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">the Leitner method</a> to quiz you. When you finish answering a flashcard, you indicate how well you knew the answer on a scale of one to five. That determines how often that same card is shown to you, with the lesser-known cards cropping up more frequently and the better-mastered cards popping up less often— it forces you to study more effectively, which is a winning strategy. </p><h2 id=\"use-notebooklm-to-shake-things-up\">Use NotebookLM to shake things up</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"NotebookLM in browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Finally, if you're a student or learner of any kind, not just an SAT-prepper, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM AI tool</a>. It's like any other AI chatbot except that it doesn't pull its responses from the Internet. Instead, it relies only on information you feed it. If you have SAT prep tests or study materials from school, a tutor, a guidance counselor, or online, you can upload them into <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">NotebookLM</a> and ask the software to generate a practice quiz, flashcards, summary, or even a \"podcast\" that features two voices discussing the content. No matter how you learn best, NotebookLM has a feature to support you. </p><p>Importantly, it only uses the materials you upload, like I said. This means you won't get any random or incorrect content from the far reaches of the Internet; you'll only get information you select and input. ChatGPT gets things wrong all the time (and I have seen it <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">generate complete nonsense</a> when dealing with people I tutor in writing), so this is a welcome resource if you like using AI but are worried about being misled. It's available on iOS, Android, and your desktop browser.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

than AirPods. AirPods sync between all your Apple devices, sound great, and ship with features like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a> and even a heart rate monitor. The problem comes, however, if something happens to your buds—especially when your battery starts to lose its capacity to hold a charge. Unlike your iPhone, whose battery is easily replaceable, AirPods aren't simple to repair. As it happens, they might not be repairable at all.  </p><p>It seems that hasn't changed with Apple's latest earbuds, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/airpods-pro-3-are-more-forgiving-for-the-tine-eared\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 3</a>. iFixit put the newest AirPods Pro through a teardown test to see how repairable they might be. The result? A whopping zero out of 10: totally unrepairable. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"airpods-pro-3-cant-be-fixed\">AirPods Pro 3 can't be fixed</h2><p>There are a number of issues in the AirPods Pro 3's design that lead to iFixit's declaration here. Chief among them is that Apple chooses to seal the entire casing with strong glue. In order to open up the buds, you need to heat them to loosen that glue, then pry the buds open with sharp tools. You need to both avoid melting the plastic of the earbuds themselves, while also trying hard not to disfigure the case while slicing it open. It's a tough balancing act. </p><p>Once inside, however, the trouble only continues. The battery is also held down with strong glue, so, once again, you need to apply heat without melting the earbud itself. Even if you successfully remove the battery, it's extremely difficult to reassemble all of the elements here—or to, god forbid, attempt to <em>replace</em> one of those elements should they break. Apple has designed these earbuds to pack a ton of tech into a <em>tiny</em> package, with both glue and soldering, which means you run the risk of destroying crucial components when moving them around. It's all too easy to accidentally ruin the microphones or noise cancelling tech here.</p><p>The same goes for the stem of the buds, and even the AirPods Pro 3 case: Both are all glued up, and are too easy to destroy while attempting to open or fix a component. In fact, iFixit says these \"repairs\" are so difficult, many repair shops don't even bother. Between the need for special tools and the risk for failure, they simply forgo AirPods repair attempts.</p><p>This nothing new for AirPods. According to iFixit, all of Apple's previous Bluetooth earbuds have the same problem. As it happens, all AirPods models—save for the AirPods Max—have achieved a zero out of 10 on iFixit's scale. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"are-there-repairable-earbuds\">Are there repairable earbuds?</h2><p>While many other earbud brands score better on the repairability scale, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/wireless-earbud-repairability-scores\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">many also don't fare much<em> </em>better</a> than AirPods. Scroll through iFixit's list, and you'll find other scores ranging from zero to three out of 10. It seems a lot of companies follow Apple's lead here and solder their batteries and components together with glue. </p><p>Still, there are some winners here, according to iFixit. The undeniable champ comes are the Fairphone Fairbuds, which scored a perfect 10 out of 10. The batteries in the earbuds are easy to replace, the case is modular and easy to disassemble, and Fairphone offers replacement parts and instructions. Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live are the runner-up with an eight out of 10: They're similarly repairable to the Fairbuds, but they don't have official repair instructions or parts, other than the batteries for the earbuds. Sony's WF-1000XM4 scored a respectable seven out of 10, as they also have easy to replace batteries with a modular case—though they don't include official parts or instructions.  </p><p>If your primary goal when buying earbuds is repairability, you do have options out there. If you want the best possible experience when using your Apple devices, AirPods are still where it's at. Just know that when something fails, such as the battery or another component, your Apple earbuds are kind of toast. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

/><p>If you want to truly<em> </em>grasp what you’re learning, not just memorize it short-term for a test, you should familiarize yourself with Kolb’s learning cycle. Hell, even if you do just want to pass a test, you should familiarize yourself with Kolb’s learning cycle. Educational theorist David A. Kolb published his experiential learning theory in 1984 and it’s been popular ever since, at least among teachers. If you haven't heard of it, that's no issue; let's go over what it's all about so you can learn better. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-kolbs-four-step-cycle\">What is Kolb’s four-step cycle?</h2><p>Kolb proposed a cycle of four stages that, once passed through, will result in effective learning:</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Concrete learning</strong>: This happens when the learner has a new experience and uses it to reinterpret or reframe an existing one. As an example, say you gave a presentation and it didn't go as well as you hoped it would, even though you felt like you prepared for it. You had a new experience and it made you reframe what you considered solid preparation. </p></li><li><p><strong>Reflective observation</strong>: This occurs when the learner thinks about the experience in a personal way. In our presentation example, this could mean you reflected on how disengaged or confused your audience looked, then questioned whether it was your speaking speed or cluttered PowerPoint slides that contributed to that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstract conceptualization</strong>: This is the part when the learner forms or modifies ideas after reflecting. Maybe here, you came up with ideas to make your next presentation better, like cutting out extra info from your slides or speaking more slowly and with better eye contact.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active experimentation</strong>: Finally, this happens when the learner <em>applies </em>the new thinking and notes if anything changes. In active experimentation, let's say you applied what you learned during the last presentation and paid attention to see how the audience responded to your new approach. </p></li></ul><p>Essentially, this method is a rigid, more academic way to describe the phenomenon of doing something, thinking about how you did it, and doing it again with some changes based on that reflection, which circles back around to the starting point of \"doing something.\"</p><p>While these steps tend to happen in order, it’s important to note that you can technically enter the cycle at any stage. For instance, you might have an experience and reflect on it, form an idea about it, and apply your thinking to your broader understanding of it, then learn more concrete details and information about it in a new class a year later. Don't get too hung up on mastering this in order, but do familiarize yourself with the stages so you can learn to recognize and use them.</p><h2 id=\"how-kolbs-cycle-looks-in-practice\">How Kolb's cycle looks in practice</h2><p>Let’s say you’re studying accounting. You have personal experience like doing your own taxes or budgeting your paycheck, which is <strong>concrete learning</strong>. You gain more experience in class, being introduced to higher-level accounting concepts. </p><p>After learning those concepts, you can do <strong>reflective observation</strong> by thinking of how your own experiences budgeting match up with what you were just taught and whether what you just learned could have enhanced your old results. </p><p>In <strong>abstract conceptualization</strong>, you apply those reflections, considering whether they impact how you approach accounting in your life and whether you’d do anything differently next time you go to budget. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>In <strong>active experimentation</strong>, you can try implementing new lessons from class in your own financial planning or working on practice exercises, informed by your own experiences and the new information. As you consider the outcome of the practical application, you start over again with the concrete learning you experienced during the exercise. </p><h2 id=\"what-to-keep-in-mind-about-kolbs-cycle\">What to keep in mind about Kolb’s cycle</h2><p>To me, the most crucial element here is the reflective observation. If you get a B on a quiz and don't go over what you did wrong, you'll get those same questions wrong on the midterm. Reflecting on what happened and what you can change is how you make the alterations you need in the future and what sets this apart as a learning and studying technique. After you study a new concept, try methods that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">force active recall</a>—like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">blurting</a>, which is saying or writing down all the content you can remember from the chapter or section—and take your time when going over what you got wrong. </p><p>This doesn't have to be a solo endeavor, either. If you're stuck on something, ask a professor or fellow student to walk you through it. Getting an outside perspective can help with reflective observation and abstract conceptualization, allowing you to reframe your thoughts on a topic. </p><p>Kolb’s cycle is usually meant for teachers to think about when lesson planning. <a href=\"https://www.structural-learning.com/post/kolbs-learning-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Structural Learning</a>, for instance, encourages educators to use this model in lessons to improve students’ understanding and problem solving. But since the goal of using the method is to encourage the acquisition of more abstract concepts—which can then be applied to a variety of topics and situations—it works for anyone. Keeping the four stages in mind while you study a new concept and reflecting on how you can hit each one will help you think more flexibly about the topic overall and help you retain what you’re learning. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

But there's one area where the smart home of the future became a normal reality while we were barely paying attention: your lights. I've been using smart lights for the better part of a decade and I can't go back to typical lights. </p><p>There are several brands of smart lights from companies like Philips, GE, Wyze, and more that can turn any lamp or light fixture into smart home-controlled lighting. You can use your phone, smart speakers like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADXP4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo&short_url=aADXP4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Amazon's Echo</u></a> line, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ao6pme?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Google%27s%20Nest&short_url=ao6pme&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Google%27s%20Nest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Google's Nest</u></a> speakers. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-light-brands-right-now\">The best smart light brands right now</h2>\n<p>Several major brands manufacture smart lights and, while it is technically possible to mix and match bulbs from different companies, it's easier if you stick to one ecosystem. With that in mind, here are a few of the most established companies and the benefits of each:</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>The reigning champion: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWEZPd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Philips%20Hue&short_url=QWEZPd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Philips%20Hue\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Philips Hue</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> These are the lights I personally use. Philips Hue is the most established competitor, with a massive array of bulbs, light strips, lamps and other lighting gear. Its software suite is also one of the most developed, with robust automation tools and colorful scene libraries. Historically, it's also been the most expensive system, but the company recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/768554/philips-hue-essentials-smart-lighting-cheaper-support-matter-thread\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>a line of cheaper bulbs</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An inexpensive entry point: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9gjB6G?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Wiz&short_url=9gjB6G&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Wiz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Wiz</u></a></strong><strong>. </strong>If you don't want to spend $50 per light bulb in your home—and who can blame you?—Wiz is an affordable alternative to Hue. The company offers full-color bulbs that start as low as around $12 per bulb, in a variety of form factors.</p></li><li><p><strong>For stylistic flair: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QVEZP3?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LIFX&short_url=QVEZP3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=LIFX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>LIFX</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> Similar to Philips Hue, LIFX is a bit more expensive, but the company offers a wide variety of unique, stylish lights, like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKq2PV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=colorful%20tube%20bulbs&short_url=QKq2PV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=colorful%20tube%20bulbs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>colorful tube bulbs</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMXPn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=flexible%20LED%20strips&short_url=9YMXPn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=flexible%20LED%20strips\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>flexible LED strips</u></a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>For customizable lighting arrays: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PKkd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nanoleaf&short_url=98PKkd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Nanoleaf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Nanoleaf</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> While Nanoleaf technically makes its own series of typical <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPVdPP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=smart%20light%20bulbs&short_url=QPVdPP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=smart%20light%20bulbs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>smart light bulbs</u></a>, the company is best known for its modular lighting kits. These kits come in shapes like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/911KNn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=hexagons&short_url=911KNn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=hexagons\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>hexagons</u></a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aeKnO2?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lines&short_url=aeKnO2&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=lines\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>lines</u></a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QLMdPo?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=blocks&short_url=QLMdPo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=blocks\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>blocks</u></a>, and more. Each piece can be individually controlled, and you can combine them to make your own designs for wall lighting. They're not subtle, but they're fun as heck.</p></li></ul><p>These are just a few of the many companies out there producing smart lights. While a few like Philips Hue require dedicated hubs to make their lights work, most companies are now focused on making standalone bulbs that can connect directly to wifi.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-need-matter-the-new-open-standard-for-smart-1850826525\" target=\"_blank\"><u>growing Matter standard</u></a> is also (slowly) making it easier to integrate lights from multiple companies. While you'll still likely need to refer to a company's own app or hub to make some changes, Matter-compatible smart lights can usually replace the need to look for \"Works With Google Home\" or similar labels for your specific setup.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-set-up-smart-lights\">What you need to set up smart lights</h2><p>In most cases, the only thing you'll technically need to set up smart lights is the lights themselves. Most smart light manufacturers at least make bulbs compatible with A19 sockets (the kind in most of your lighting fixtures and lamps), and ecosystems like Wiz, LIFX, and GE's Cync don't require a dedicated hub. Philips Hue, notably, does. And if you're getting into Hue now, you're probably best off <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9ZMpPM?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=getting%20the%20Hue%20Bridge%20Pro&short_url=9ZMpPM&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=getting%20the%20Hue%20Bridge%20Pro\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>getting the Hue Bridge Pro</u></a>, which supports syncing lights to your media, using your bulbs as motion sensors, and more new features.</p><p>While that's technically all you <em>need</em> to set up smart lights, there are a few things you can get to make even better use of your new system:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A smart speaker.</strong> I cannot emphasize enough how great it feels to turn your bedroom lights off while tucked snugly under the covers. Voice-controlled speakers like Google Nest and Amazon Echo devices are excellent for this.</p></li><li><p><strong>A smart display.</strong> The one downside to smart lights is that you can't use switches on the walls the same way anymore (more on that later). But a smart display can be a huge improvement. Google Nest Hubs or Amazon Echo Show devices can put an array of controls for your smart lights in a prominent place so anyone in your home can not only turn lights on and off with a tap, but change lighting levels or color scenes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some smartphone widgets.</strong> While all of the above are convenient, more often than not, you'll probably have your phone on you. Some smart light manufacturers build robust widgets for iPhone and Android devices, so you can tap a button on your home screen to turn your lights on and off. It's worth checking to see which features a company supports before committing to an ecosystem.</p></li></ul><p>The last things you'll need to set up your smart lights are time and patience. While the process has gotten a lot simpler than it was even a few years ago, you might need to spend a bit of time fiddling with room names, syncing services, and testing out a few commands. Fortunately, you usually only need to do this once. I've even moved to a new home and kept my old setup largely intact.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-can-do-with-smart-lights\">What you can do with smart lights</h2><p>\"Okay, sure, smart lights are getting cheaper, but are they really worth the extra money over simple bulbs and a wall switch that's worked for decades?\" I hear you cry. And I'm here to tell you, absolutely, yes. I've used a lot of new tech over the years that's fun at first, but annoying once the novelty wears off. But smart lights are one of the few areas where I never want to go back.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Here are a few of the ways I make use of smart lights on a regular basis:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Change lights with the sun.</strong> During the day, the bright, cool light coming in from your windows has a different quality than the warm, dimmer lights you're used to from lamps. With smart lights, you can set your bulbs to automatically adjust based on a set schedule (or your local sunrise/sunset) to ease the lighting conditions in your home.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set the mood for date night... </strong>Sometimes, all it takes to turn a regular Tuesday night into a romantic evening is a simple shift in mood lighting. I have a few scenes in my Philips Hue app saved for when I want to create some nice ambiance for my partner when we're having a chill evening in.</p></li><li><p><strong>…or for self-care.</strong> Similar to the above, one of my favorite Hue scenes is an animation that mimics the flickering of candlelight. Set the lights in your bathroom to this scene, draw a warm bath, toss in a bath bomb, and have the most relaxing night in.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simulate activity while you're away. </strong>One of the best ways to make a local burglar think twice about trying to enter your home is to convince them someone is there. With lighting schedules, you can set your home to turn lights on and off even while you're away.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn lights on automatically for you.</strong> Ever trip over things in the dark while you're bringing in groceries? No more. Most smart light ecosystems allow you to automatically turn on certain lights when you enter a geofenced area (like your home). Alternatively, some suites like Philips Hue have motion-sensing features so you can turn lights on when you enter a room, without relying on tools like GPS.</p></li></ul><p>With <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/explore/smart-lights-collection\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>automation services like IFTTT</u></a>, you can even set up more complex controls—e.g., flashing lights when your doorbell rings, or blinking a light in your office when you get an email from your boss.</p><h2 id=\"smart-light-switches-make-it-all-even-easier\">Smart light switches make it all even easier</h2>\n<p>When I first set up smart lights in my home, my loved ones were mostly on board, but there was one point of contention: the light switch. People are still generally used to flipping switches when they enter a room. With smart lights, they generally need to stay on all the time, and you even need to retrain your muscle memory a bit to not forget and accidentally turn them off manually.</p><p>There are two main ways to fix this in the smart home world, and which one you need can depend on how much effort you want to put in (and, frankly, whether you rent or own your home):</p><ul><li><p><strong>In-wall smart light switches.</strong> Some smart light switches, like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADXk4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=this%20one%20from%20LIFX&short_url=aADXk4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=this%20one%20from%20LIFX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this one from LIFX</u></a> can be installed directly in place of your existing light switches. This one lets you turn a light on or off from the wall switch, without cutting off the ability to turn it back on from a voice command or smart phone app. Since it also replaces the old switch, there's less need to adjust your muscle memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote control switches.</strong> If you don't want to (or can't) replace your in-wall light switches, companies like Philips Hue offer a handy alternative in the form of <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8bP3?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=remote%20switches&short_url=aN8bP3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=remote%20switches\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>remote switches</u></a>. These provide buttons you can use to turn on/off or dim lights from a battery-powered remote. This model in particular comes with a plate you can stick on your wall next to your regular switch, while the remote is removable so you can take it with you around the room. It uses sticky pads and magnets for mounting, so you can safely put it up in an apartment and take it with you when you move.</p></li></ul><p>Strictly speaking, smart light switches are optional. That's part of the appeal of smart lights, after all. But if you live in a home with multiple people, and if you have guests over who might not have access to your lighting controls, a physical switch can be a handy addition.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBCTTAXSPT16PPXAXT850/image.fill.size_150x150.v1699836235.jpg\" alt=\"author image\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Eric</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-smart-home-gear-entertainment-system\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57HA8Q8665JNPEF4CQFDQ41/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759155124.jpg\" alt=\"TV screen with gears in front\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/pixel-watch-3-labor-day-sale-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K3VGYYH3YY3KKHA8HFWJSDT0/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1756493346.png\" alt=\"A Pixel Watch 3 on a table\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>",

This measurement is the basis for recovery scores and stress readings, and you can usually find it as a standalone measurement in the “vitals” section of your chosen app. So let’s break down what this number actually measures, and how to interpret yours. </p><h2 id=\"hrv-is-heart-rate-variability\">HRV is heart rate variability</h2><p>HRV stands for heart rate variability, but that doesn’t mean what you might think. HRV is <em>not</em> related to your heart rate changing throughout the day or during exercise. (Your heart beats faster when you’re exercising hard, which is what <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate zones</u></a> measure. Totally different purpose.) </p>\n<p>Heart rate variability refers to <em>how rhythmically</em> your heart beats. If the time from one beat to the next is always the same (at a given heart rate), you have low HRV. But if some heartbeats come more closely together, and some are more spaced out, you have high HRV. </p><p>This may be surprising, but you actually <em>want</em> your heart rate to show some variation. High HRV is considered to be better than low HRV. Your fitness app will say you’re well recovered if your HRV was higher than usual last night, and it will say you’re stressed or not recovering well if your HRV was low. </p><p>That said, it’s of course possible to have a heart rate that is <em>too</em> variable. In a sense, that’s what an arrhythmia is. When I’m talking about HRV here—and when fitness apps report your HRV—they’re considering the teeny tiny differences from beat to beat in an otherwise normal(ish) healthy(ish) person. </p><p>These differences are measured in milliseconds, and you wouldn’t notice them if you didn’t have a watch sampling data while you sleep. If you ever notice anything wildly strange about the rhythm of your heart, ask your doctor (or seek emergency medical help, if appropriate). </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-high-hrv-mean\">What does a high HRV mean? </h2><p>High heart rate variability (that is, high <em>for you</em>) tends to mean that you’re relatively relaxed and not too stressed. Fitness apps will bump up your readiness and recovery scores when your HRV measured during sleep is high. </p><p>The variation in beats is thought to come from the push and pull of two different body systems, the sympathetic (“fight or flight”) and parasympathetic (“rest and digest”) nervous systems. It’s normal for your brain and body to be balancing these needs, so this is considered a good, normal functioning. </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-low-hrv-mean\">What does a low HRV mean? </h2><p>Low HRV tends to occur when your body is working on something—recovering from hard exercise, fighting off a cold, experiencing lots of stress. If your HRV measured during sleep is low, you’ll get lower readiness or recovery scores. I find my HRV tanks when I’m sick or when I’ve been through a rough time either physically or mentally. (The day after a race or a weightlifting competition is always a low HRV day for me.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-good-hrv-number\">What is a “good” HRV number? </h2><p>I’ll give you some numbers in a minute, but the most important thing to know is that HRV is most useful when you compare readings to <em>what is normal for you</em>. Your HRV can be higher than mine, but still low for you, or vice versa. </p><p>So please don’t go around asking whether an HRV of 50 is “good.” Is it higher than usual <em>for you</em>? Then it’s good. Is it lower than usual for you? Then maybe it’s indicating that your body is under stress. If your typical HRV readings range from 35 to 50 (for example), then 50 is high for you. </p><p>It doesn’t matter whether the average person your age has a HRV of 20 or of 100; those numbers are just fun facts about the population in general. They don’t apply to you. Studies tend to show that fitter people have higher HRV, but also that HRV declines as we age. The average man’s HRV is slightly higher than the average woman’s, but the full range of what’s “normal” for each gender almost fully overlaps.</p><p>There’s one more important caveat: when you look up HRV data, you’ll find that different studies and different devices each measure HRV differently. For example, <a href=\"https://doctaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/A_Quantitative_Systematic_Review_of_Normal_Values_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this meta-analysis</u></a> found the average HRV was 42, with a range of 19 to 75, when measured as rMSSD (root mean square of successive differences). </p><p>So—and remember this is just for fun, here are some graphs from two wearable companies that publish their data <em>and</em> they both use rMSSD:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/normal-hrv-range-age-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Whoop’s breakdown of HRV data from their users</u></a> finds men have an average of 40 and women 37. They have graphs breaking down how this changes with age, and showing the variation for each group. </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/average-hrv/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Oura’s breakdown of HRV from their users</u></a> finds an average of 41 across all users, and they also graph it by age and gender. </p></li></ul><p>As I’ve found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-fitness-tracker-measure-hrv\" target=\"_blank\"><u>when comparing multiple devices on HRV</u></a>, devices don’t always report the same HRV numbers, but usually you can follow similar trends on all of them. If you’re sick, they’ll all report low HRV. If you have a good day, they’ll all report high HRV. So pay more attention to the trend than the specifics.</p>\n            </article>",

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Smart home devices can streamline a lot of your day-to-day tasks. With an internet connection and some simple automations, you may never have to carry house keys, turn off the lights, or touch your thermostat again. But all of this convenience comes at a potential cost, as smart tech is vulnerable to attack by cyber actors, leaving your personal data and your privacy at risk. </p><p>Here's what you need to know to secure your smart home.</p><h2 id=\"is-your-smart-home-secure\">Is your smart home secure? </h2><p>The short answer: not by default. Smart homes have vulnerabilities at multiple levels, from the devices themselves, to your home network, to the physical endpoints, like your phone, that have access to and control over your Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\n<p>To start, IoT devices may have weak built-in security protocols or lack clear instructions to help users lock them down from factory settings, leaving them vulnerable to hackers, who may have to exert very little effort to access your data or spy on you. Wifi routers and smart home devices often have default credentials that are publicly available and therefore easy to get past—and  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/router-reality-check-86-percent-default-passwords-have-never-been-changed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">data show</a> that the vast majority of users have never changed their router admin password or adjusted any factory settings. If your home network isn't secure, nothing connected to it can be considered secure either. </p><p>Smart devices can also be integrated into botnets, allowing threat actors to conduct malicious activity like account takeovers and malware distribution using your home network. A recent instance of this was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign known as BADBOX 2.0</a>, which targeted off-brand consumer electronics manufactured in China. </p><p>Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), notes the digital divide may increase the risk for some consumers, who may seek out cheaper devices from low-cost manufacturers that have weaker security and far less to lose in terms of reputation if they are implicated in vulnerabilities as compared to major companies like Amazon. </p><p>Finally, security can be compromised if your physical devices fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you control your smart home using apps on your phone, a threat actor could gain access in the event said phone is lost, stolen, or hacked.  </p><h2 id=\"smart-homes-can-compromise-privacy\">Smart homes can compromise privacy</h2><p>Left unsecured, smart home devices can also put your privacy (and potentially your safety) at risk. Internet-connected cameras, from baby monitors to pet cams, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/can-someone-spy-through-webcam-or-phone\" target=\"_blank\">are vulnerable to hacking</a>, and threat actors can use them to surveil you and your home. This may include snooping on and tracking your movements, \"shoulder surfing\" to collect sensitive personal information from your devices, recording audio and video footage of your private activities, and sharing or selling live feeds on the dark web. (In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-baby-monitor-hacked-by-man-who-threatened-kidnapping-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a particularly alarming incident in 2018</a>, a hacker reportedly issued verbal threats toward a four-month-old child through a Nest-branded baby monitor.)</p><p>Your smart tech is also likely collecting a lot of information about you in the course of its normal activities—all of which could be exploited. For example, your robot vacuum creates and utilizes a map of your home's physical layout to know where to go, and usage patterns from various automations can be used to track your movements and confirm when you're away from home. </p><p>There's also the possibility that your smart home devices are compromising your data in ways you aren't aware of and haven't actively consented to. A <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-reveals-alarming-privacy-and-security-threats-smart-homes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2023 report from security experts</a>—led by the nonprofit IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University—shows that IoT devices may inadvertently expose personal information that can be harvested and sold to companies involved in surveillance capitalism. Researchers found that spyware apps and advertisers abuse local network protocols to access sensitive data, making it easier to profile users. </p><h2 id=\"no-security-standards-for-smart-homes\">No security standards for smart homes</h2><p>One of the biggest barriers to smart home security is that there isn't a single set of cybersecurity standards that companies have to follow, nor a centralized resource for users to research this information. Earlier this year—during the last few weeks of the Biden administration—the Federal Communications Commission launched the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">U.S. Cyber Trust Mark</a> voluntary labeling program to incentivize device manufacturers to improve security and help consumers buy with confidence. However, under the Trump administration, the agency later <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-cyber-trust-mark-ul-investigation-delay/758507/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">launched an investigation</a> into the program, delaying its rollout. </p><p>For now, consumers are left to do their own due diligence. In 2017, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation created a resource called <a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">*Privacy Not Included</a>, with reviews of products measured against \"minimum security standards\" and breakdowns of any privacy concerns. The site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last year, but you can still find detailed information about the privacy and security history of well-known smart home manufacturers like Amazon, Google, Wyze, and Ecobee. </p><p>Otherwise, Budington suggests simply searching the device you're considering (and the company that makes it) before buying, to see if researchers or users have reported any concerns. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-improve-your-smart-home-security\">How to improve your smart home security</h2><p>Securing your smart home starts with securing your internet connection via your router. Lifehacker has assembled a whole <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-make-your-home-security-system-and-wireless-network-safe\" target=\"_blank\">guide to protecting your home network</a>, but at the very least, you should change any default router settings—admin usernames, passwords, and network names—to something unique and not personally identifiable, and turn on encryption in your wireless security settings. Regularly check for updates, which provide patches for security flaws, and audit the devices connected to your network to identify anything suspicious and remove those you no longer use. </p><p>You can add another layer of security with a guest network set up specifically for your IoT devices. That way, if your smart devices are compromised, everything connected to your primary network (such as computers and phones with access to your personal and financial accounts) will be protected. </p><p>According to Budington, one way to further mitigate vulnerability is to reduce the number of devices with their own wireless connection, running them through a secure, centralized hub instead. Home Assistant is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/self-host-apps\" target=\"_blank\">self-hosted option</a> that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or a traditional PC or used with the plug-and-play Home Assistant Green. Hubitat also gives you local control over your device data and integrates with a variety of products, including those compatible with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-most-important-smart-home-decision-is-the-ecosystem-you-choose\" target=\"_blank\">Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter standards</a>. </p><p>Once your network is secure, you'll want to <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/securing-your-internet-connected-devices-home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">take similar steps</a> with each of your IoT devices. Change default usernames and passwords to unique, secure alternatives and enable all available security features, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, in the device settings. Ensure your devices (and any apps used to control them) receive automatic firmware updates. </p><p>You should also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-protect-your-privacy-when-using-smart-home-tech\" target=\"_blank\">check your device's privacy settings</a>, removing permissions that aren't essential for it to function and disabling features you won't use. For example, you could turn off location tracking on your smart thermostat and disable voice control for devices other than your voice assistant. </p><p>Finally, while we've focused mostly on digital threats, your smart home isn't immune to physical compromise. Be aware of ways your devices can be accessed, such as those installed on the exterior of your house, and ensure phones and tablets and the apps on them that control IoT devices are secured with a PIN or biometric authentication.</p><p>Remember that, by nature, anything connected to the internet is at least somewhat vulnerable to attack. You'll have to consider your own risk tolerance and weigh the convenience of having a smart device against the potential for it to be compromised—and your privacy along with it. You may find that there are some things that you simply don't need to automate, and therefore you can stick with the \"dumb\" alternative. </p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBGBC5PWJAAJJJHG350CH/image.fill.size_150x150.v1737570988.png\" alt=\"Photo of Emily Long\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Emily</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-october-3-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K68SAJARB6DP9MCHE0P6EXZY/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759084104.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-set-up-alexa-wishlist-alerts-for-prime-day\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GRM6DN5FBJ884KM2D6W12/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1699834542.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Alexa Echo Dot third and fourth generation\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>",

This is where the GIST method can prove extremely useful.</p><p>The worst-case scenario when you're studying is that you read and read and read, but don't exactly retain much of it. That's even worse than if you don't study at all because you wasted all that time and it can be extremely demoralizing. GIST will help avoid that fate if you do it right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-gist-method\">What is the GIST method?</h2><p>The GIST method is an aptly-named system for condensing your notes (or anything you’ve read, like a chapter in a book) so everything is as simple as possible to read through and review. The point is to help you get the <em>gist</em> of the content block. Get it? </p><p>This approach requires you to resist the natural urge to pack your notes with too many details. The GIST method helps you break that habit. With it, you'll practice breaking each point down to 25 words or so. It might seem like that's just not enough to fully encapsulate everything you're learning—and it's not. It's enough to give you a solid, foundational understanding of the material that you can then build on once you get the basics down. Instead of reading thousands of words and retaining just a few of them because you have no real fundamental grasp of the ideas, you're creating a more concrete understanding of the most elemental parts.</p><p>“GIST” is an acronym for “Generating Interactions between Schemata and Texts.” It's clunky because it was obviously retrofitted to match up with the word \"GIST\" itself, a perfect example of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-use-association-to-remember-what-you-1850861942\" target=\"_blank\">using the association technique</a> to remember steps in a sequence. What this all means, in simpler terms, is creating a framework between the text you’re working from (whether that’s your full class notes or a textbook excerpt) and your condensed notes. Once you have identified the GIST of whatever you’re studying, it can serve as a roadmap to guide your review sessions, so you’re sure you’re focusing on the most critical details.</p><p>You ask yourself a few questions: What is happening? Who is doing it? When is it happening? Where is it happening? Why is it happening (or why is it important that it's happening)? How is it happening? It can be helpful to think of the familiar “Five Ws and H.” Once you have collected all of that information, write it out simply in a short-form block.</p><p>To clarify, the GIST itself isn’t what you’ll be studying. The goal is to help you identify the main message or idea of a text and hone in on it until you understand it at its most basic level. From there you can move on to the more complicated, weedy parts, too—and <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/these-are-my-favorite-mind-mapping-templates-for-studyi-1850843156\" target=\"_blank\">methods like mind mapping</a> will help you get there.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-start-using-the-gist-method-to-summarize-your-class-notes\">How to start using the GIST method to summarize your class notes</h2><p>The GIST method starts with a close reading of your notes/chapter/assigned text. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-close-reading-to-retain-every-detail-when-you-study-1850849002\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a full guide</a> on close reading.) It’s better to do this with shorter chunks of information than multiple chapters or lessons. Next, grab a sticky note or notebook paper and write, in a column, the <em>who, what, when, where, why, </em>and <em>how</em>. Answer the questions simply, taking the information straight from your notes or reading. Next, write a paragraph underneath, limiting yourself to approximately 25 words. The paragraph should summarize the answers to the questions above.</p><p>Say you're studying the Boston Tea Party. Who was involved? It was colonialists and the Sons of Liberty. What did they do? They protested against the British Tax Act. When did they do it? They did it December 16, 1773. Where did they do it? They did it in Boston Harbor. Why did they do it? They opposed taxation without representation. How did they do it? They boarded British ships and dumped tea into the harbor.</p><p>Once you have those basic answers written down, you'd write your paragraph like this: \"In December 1773, American colonists protested British taxes by dumping tea into Boston Harbor, opposing the Tea Act and taxation without representation.\" That paragraph is now the jumping-off point for everything else you have to learn. Anything else you read or go over after that will make more sense after being mapped onto this simpler distillation.</p><p>You can use a prepared GIST template to help you through the process, though <a href=\"https://www.readwritethink.org/sites/default/files/resources/lesson_images/lesson290/Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some limit your GIST to 20 words</a>. For condensing notes or studying at a higher level, 25 words is a good number to aim for, as it lets you expand complicated concepts with just a little more information—but not too much. </p>\n            </article>",

/><p>When you’re assigned a text, you’re supposed to take away the big-picture ideas. The problem is that sometimes, you can miss the forest for the trees, skimming passages just to get it all over with. To get to that broad understanding you need, you should use a method that is all about being detail-oriented. It’s called “close reading,” and it will help you grasp whatever you read so you understand not only your assigned passage or chapter, but the concept you're studying overall.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-close-reading\">What is close reading?</h2><p>Close reading is a method that requires you to focus on every detail in a text and operate on the assumption that no detail is in there by accident or for no reason. That's not an assumption so much as it's a fact. Think about the process required for that content to be in front of you. A subject matter expert had to research it all, write it all down, pass it through perhaps an agent and definitely an editor, if not multiple editors. If it's for school, that material had to be reviewed by some kind of board and approved for use. Everything that made it to the final version had multiple sets of eyes on it. All of it is important and deserves to be there; anything irrelevant would likely have been cut. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/oPrXY?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Teaching%20Literature&short_url=oPrXY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fuse-close-reading-to-retain-every-detail-when-you-study&event_label=Teaching%20Literature\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>Teaching Literature</em></a>, literary critic Elaine Showalter says that “close reading” is “slow reading, a deliberate attempt to detach ourselves from the magical power of storytelling and pay attention to language, imagery, allusion, intertextuality, syntax, and form.” The idea is to break the habit of reading casually or taking everything in at once and instead form a new habit wherein you examine every tiny element of what you’re reading and question why the author included it.</p><p>The method is even included in the <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED541436.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">United States’ Common Core standards for K-12 education</a>. There, it’s defined as “the methodical investigation of a complex text through answering text dependent questions geared to unpack the text’s meaning.” </p><p>Essentially, you’re not just looking at what the text says, but <em>how </em>it says it—and that’s beneficial: <a href=\"https://litinfocus.com/4-major-benefits-close-reading/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Per Literacy in Focus</a>, that means you’ll eventually be able to truly grasp what the text <em>means</em>. <a href=\"https://fisherpub.sjf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1238&context=education_ETD_masters\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Educators have researched</a> the use of the method and found it increases reading comprehension, for instance. Using close reading helps learners understand what a text says, but also why it’s important. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-close-reading-method\">How to use the close reading method</h2><p>Close reading involves reading everything twice (or more than twice). The first time is to get what it says, but the following times are to understand why it says it and why it says it <em>that way</em>. The goal is to be able to apply that deeper thinking and understanding to what you learned the first time through.</p><h3>Read for understanding</h3><p>On your first pass through the material, just get the gist. Figure out the main argument or story, who is speaking, and to whom. Don't worry about details. Just take it all in and make a mental note of what stands out, confuses or, or seems relevant.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Read for details</h3><p>On your second time through the content, you'll actually do the \"close reading\" part. Highlight key terms, circle new words, and look all of those those up. Pay special attention to formatting, like subtitles, section breaks, and visuals like charts or photos. Remember: None of it is in there by accident. Think, too, about how the information is ordered. Does the author start broad, describing an issue before zeroing in on examples? Or do they start with a specific example and <em>then</em> explain broader context? </p><h3>Ask questions</h3><p>Read it again, but this time, ask questions. Write them down on a separate paper or even in the margins. It's likely you'll be reading something digital, so just open up a blank word processing doc if you have to. Some questions to ask, though these will vary depending on your content, grade level, author, and more:</p><ul><li><p>Why is this section titled the way it is?</p></li><li><p>Why did the author use that [evocative/obscure/flippant/etc.] word?</p></li><li><p>Why introduce this idea before that one?</p></li><li><p>Why did the author start the chapter with a character-driven story before explaining the broader context? </p></li><li><p>Who is the intended audience? Students? Educators? The general public? Plumbers? Politicians? </p></li></ul><p>Crucially, ask questions even—or especially—if you're unsure of the answer. Maybe you <em>don't</em> know why the author used a particular phrase or for whom the content was written. That doesn't matter. By asking, you become more curious and think more deeply. It keeps you engaged. </p><h3>Read for meaning</h3><p>Once you've read it enough times that you've identified the main idea and found some questions to ask, you've made it to your final read-through. Here, zoom out. Stop thinking of individual words, unusual punctuation, or why the author included a particular graph. Think instead of the bigger picture again, like you did on that first read-through. What's the author's purpose? How do the things you noticed the second time through or the questions you asked the third time through contribute to that message? </p><p>Maybe a recurring reference in a short story hints at a theme. Maybe the structure of an essay is meant to mirror the thoughts of its subject. That's what this exercise is about. You're moving beyond <em>what</em> the text says and understanding <em>how</em> it's delivering its message. Obviously, this is a useful practice when studying literature, but it works for a variety of subjects. If you're reading history, you might wonder why an author frames a particular battle or policy in a negative or positive way and wonder, too, how the people on the other side of that battle or policy felt—and why their view isn't represented. Even asking those questions gets you thinking deeper and relating more to the material, which makes it not only easier to understand, but easier to remember. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

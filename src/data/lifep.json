But there's a big problem that makes this a lot harder (and more expensive) than it should be: battery incompatibility. By design, you can’t simply pop a Ryobi battery into a DeWalt tool and expect it to work. Engineering decisions aside, using proprietary batteries allows companies to create a sort of obligatory brand loyalty, forcing you to stick with their line of tools unless you want to invest in a whole new set of batteries for every new tool you buy.If you've been building your cordless tool collection for some time, you may wind up with four or five different chargers and multiple batteries cluttering your workspace. And that clutter can be expensive, because you wind up buying more chargers and batteries than you might not need if batteries were interchangeable.But it turns out they are, sort of. You can actually swap batteries between brands—you just need the right adapters.\nAdapters let you swap tool batteries between brandsThere are two kinds of battery adapters to consider:Inter-brand adapters allow you to use one brand’s batteries in another brand’s tool (like DeWalt batteries in Milwaukee tools).Voltage adapters allow you to use a different voltage battery than the tool expects (say, a 20-volt battery in a 18-volt tool).These adapters are a fairly simple solution to the problem of incompatible battery systems. If you have a lot of DeWalt tools, for example, you can purchase a Milwaukee tool without a battery (which will be cheaper) and just use an adapter to plug in one of the DeWalt batteries you already have.\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nOf course, these batteries weren’t specifically designed for these tools, so there can be some trade-offs. While tool performance has been found to be broadly similar (and some tools even performed better when using batteries from different brands), for some tools (like grinders and some circular saws) there’s a dropoff in power and performance when using an adapter. That said, you might not notice it if you're just looking to tackling simple DIY projects around the house. Another caveat to consider: You might lose some features. Some tools are designed to communicate with the battery to modulate power draw in order to extend the life of the battery, and using an adapter will remove this functionality. But again, if you’re simply using a power drill for basic maintenance tasks, this might not be a huge issue for you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUniversal adapters are a good solution if you own a bunch of brandsIf you’ve got a bunch of disparate tool brands, of course, buying multiple adapters might not seem like much of an improvement over your collection of batteries and chargers. If this is you, consider something like the Ceenr PDNation Universal Battery System, which provides an 18-volt battery and a series of adapters that allow it to be used in a wide range of power tools, including major brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, and DeWalt.For example, you can buy a battery with an adapter for DeWalt tools, then buy a second adapter for the same battery that will work with Makita tools. This means you can standardize on one battery system for pretty much any tool you buy (it’s not a truly universal system, since you’re dependent on the range of adapters they offer, but it’s probably close enough for most people).As with other adapters, there can be some performance loss using a universal adapter, but by and large, it’s probably not a big issue if you’re doing work around the house, as opposed to working professionally on a job site.\n            \n    ",

Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies. See personalized, AI-powered snapshots Gmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.AI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\" \nGet AI Overviews via Gmail searchGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI will proofread your emailsFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise. Like AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

On the surface, the two extensions identified by Ox Security researchers look pretty benign. The first, named \"Chat GPT for Chrome with GPT-5, Claude Sonnet & DeepSeek AI,\" has a Featured badge and 2.7K ratings with over 600,000 users. \"AI Sidebar with Deepseek, ChatGPT, Claude and more\" appears verified and has 2.2K ratings with 300,000 users. However, these add-ons are actually sending AI chatbot conversations and browsing data directly to threat actors' servers. This means that hackers have access to plenty of sensitive information that users share with ChatGPT and DeepSeek as well as URLs from Chrome tabs, search queries, session tokens, user IDs, and authentication data. Any of this can be used to conduct identity theft, phishing campaigns, and even corporate espionage. \nResearchers found that the extensions impersonate legitimate Chrome add-ons developed by AITOPIA that add a sidebar to any website with the ability to chat with popular LLMs. The malicious capabilities stem from a request for consent for “anonymous, non-identifiable analytics data.\" Threat actors are  using Lovable, a web development platform, to host privacy policies and infrastructure, obscuring their processes. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nResearchers also found that if you uninstalled one of the extensions, the other would open in a new tab in an attempt to trick users into installing that one instead. How to avoid malicious browser add-onsIf you've added AI-related extensions to Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/ and look for the malicious impersonators. Hit Remove if you find them. As of this writing, the extensions identified by Ox no longer appear in the Chrome Web Store. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs I've written about before, malicious extensions occasionally evade detection and gain approval from browser libraries by posing as legitimate add-ons, even earning \"Featured\" and \"Verified\" tags. Some threat actors playing the long game will convert extensions to malware several years after launch. This means you can't blindly trust ratings and reviews, even if they've been accrued over time. To minimize risk, you should always vet browser extensions carefully (even those that appear legit) for obvious red flags, like misspellings in the description and a large number of positive reviews accumulated in a short time. Head to Google or Reddit to see if anyone has identified the add-on as malicious or found any issues with the developer or source. Make sure you're downloading the right extension—threat actors often try to confuse users with names that appear similar to popular add-ons. Finally, you should regularly audit your extensions and remove those that aren't essential. Go to chrome://extensions/ to see everything you have installed. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware. AMD calls Helios \"The world's best AI rack\" During a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced—against a backdrop of dramatic music—\"Helios,\" the company's upcoming AI rack, which packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds. Each \"cross-section\" of these racks is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: the company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking it's real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.  AMD Ryzen AI 400 seriesIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking when compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V. These new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.\n            \n    ",

But in a market crowded with ANC earbuds that do little more than meet the bare minimum, these justify their price tag by leaning into thoughtful features, sound quality, and build that go beyond the basics. Right now, a brand-new pair of Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 earbuds are going for $279.99 (originally $399) on Woot, their lowest price ever. \nCompared to the Pi7, the Pi8 has improved noise cancellation, higher-grade 12mm drivers with Carbon Cone technology, and an upgraded digital-to-analog converter alongside an updated digital signal processor. Its charging case also functions as a Bluetooth transceiver, making it seamlessly functional with in-flight entertainment when you’re on the go. CNET, in a glowing review, dubbed them “easily among the best-sounding earbuds out there,” and they also have a more secure and comfortable fit than their predecessors, making them more ergonomic. The review does note that they don’t have a 3.5mm headphone port but do include a USB-C to 3.5mm cable adaptor.The Pi8 earbuds have the latest Bluetooth 5.4 with support for aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless for top-quality wireless streaming, as well as an IP54 dust and sweat rating. The case offers around 6.5 hours per charge with ANC on, going up to 13.5 hours with the charging case and a 15-minute quick charge that gives you 2 hours of playback. While 6.5 hours is decent, it’s not best-in-class compared to competitors that reach the eight to 10 hour mark. And although it has three built-in mics for calls, users also note that background noise can occasionally leak through.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUltimately, if premium sound quality, music fidelity, and rare features like wired retransmission are at the top of your priority list, the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 earbuds are a comfy and travel-friendly option with competitive ANC. However, if your top priorities are maximum noise cancellation and battery life, you may want to consider the (lower-priced) Bose QuietComfort earbuds instead. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Some devices are more bloated than others: Google Pixels have a relatively \"clean\" build compared to Samsung phones, for example, and don't typically come with third-party apps and games. But you may still want to eliminate apps and features that clutter your home screen, take up valuable space, and create a drag on performance, especially if you have alternatives you like more. On Android, that likely means uninstalling what you easily can and disabling everything else. What you can (and can't) uninstall on AndroidUnfortunately, many preinstalled first-party apps can't be easily removed. This varies by manufacturer and device—for example, Pixel users can uninstall Google Play Games and Books but are stuck with Chrome, Drive, Maps, and Calculator. As HowToGeek points out, you can delete other pre-selected Google apps added during initial setup, such as the Pixel Watch app and NotebookLM. \nOn Samsung Galaxy phones, again, some preinstalled bloatware is locked in, but ZDNET calls out five native apps that most users should delete right away: Global Goals, Samsung Free, Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Shop, and Samsung Kids. To uninstall an app on your Pixel, go to the Google Play Store and tap the Profile icon. Tap Manage apps & devices > Manage, select the app you want to remove, and tap Uninstall. On Samsung, go to Settings > Apps, tap the app name, and tap Uninstall > OK. You can also touch and hold the app icon on your home screen and tap or drag to uninstall. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're absolutely set on removing preinstalled apps that can't be deleted using the above steps, you can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), but these methods are more advanced. How to disable preinstalled appsBuilt-in apps that aren't in use can be disabled, which hides the icon from your app drawer. They'll still take up space, but at least they'll be out of sight. Most preinstalled apps can be disabled if you don't need them, with the exception of critical system apps. On your Pixel, go to Settings > Apps > See all apps to select individual apps, and tap Disable at the top of the screen. You can hide preinstalled Samsung apps from your home screen settings: tap Hide apps and tap the icon of the apps you want to disable, the press Done. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.Looking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n    \n            \n            New ROG Zephyrus Duo (left) vs. ROG Zephyrus Duo 2023 (right).\n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Asus\n                    \n    \nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.The new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.\n            \n    ",

And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.POP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.How to keep your third-party accounts working in GmailIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.Use IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.The IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

California residents have gained more control over their personal data than those in other states since the passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in 2018, and they now have a one-stop shop for requesting that their information be removed from hundreds of data brokers registered with the state (and any that do so in the future). California isn't the only state to enact stronger consumer privacy laws in recent years, but its Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) is the first of its kind. The tool is live now, though brokers won't begin processing submissions until August. Here's what to do now if you live in California—and some options for removing your information from data brokers if you don't. How to sign up for California's data removal platformTo get started with DROP, you'll need to confirm that you are, in fact, a California resident by verifying personal information via California Identity Gateway or signing in with Login.gov credentials. To be eligible, you must either live in California or be domiciled in the state even if you live elsewhere temporarily. (This is based on the location of your primary residence, where you are registered to vote, and which state issued your driver's license.)\nYou will then be able to create and submit a deletion request. You'll need to provide some personal data, which will be used to match your request with records held by data brokers. Data types include names, date of birth, zip codes, email addresses, phone numbers, Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs), and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). You can enter multiples of everything except your date of birth and update your request at a later time—if you get a new car or change your email, for example. While you can begin submitting requests now, know that data brokers won't actually begin processing them until August 2026 and could take up to 90 days from then to delete your data. If they find a match, they are required to delete all of the information they have about you, though there are some exceptions, such as data available through public records or provided directly to a business. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nOnce processing begins later this year, you'll be able to track the status of your request on the DROP platform. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAlternatives for deleting your dataIf you don't reside in California and qualify for DROP, all is not lost—though you will have to invest a bit more time and/or money to remove your information from data broker sites than simply mass deleting via a single request. To start opting out of data collection, download Consumer Reports' donation-based Permission Slip app, which tracks where your data can be found and follows up on removal requests. You can try to manually opt out by identifying data brokers and going directly to their sites, but this can be tedious, and there are a handful of other paid services that will do it for you. (None are perfect, nor do they guarantee 100% success.) We also have a guide to blocking companies from tracking your online activities, which can help mitigate the problem somewhat before it begins. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching. YouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one. If you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search. \nHow to remove YouTube Shorts from searchTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.Other changes to YouTube filtersIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.    Finally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters. \n            \n    ",

As a dog owner, I know I don't. But fires do happen, and pets can't follow your family fire plan. Rescue Retriever wants to change that. I spoke with the company during CES' Pepcom event, and learned how it's working to make it easier for firefighters to find your pets in the event of a fire. (Rescue Retriever first launched back in March of 2024. The company was started by two brothers—one of whom is a former firefighter.)During a fire, pets tend to run to where they feel safe—maybe that's under the bed, or somewhere tucked away in a room. That makes it difficult for firefighters to locate pets during an emergency: In a situation where seconds count, they don't have the ability to search every corner of a burning home. Unfortunately, as a result, pets sometimes don't make it out. Rescue Retriever wants to change that.Rescue Retriever's smoke detector is installed near your pet's safe spaceIn an attempt to solve that problem, Rescue Retriever's smoke detector works a bit differently. It isn't supposed to be placed where your current smoke detector is; rather, the idea is to place it where your pet is most likely to go when scared. If you know they like to hide under your bed, for example, you can place the detector there. Once the device detects smoke during a fire, a bright light begins to strobe inside, spread out by a mix of holes placed throughout the device. (Even under the bright lights of Pepcom, the strobe looked intense to me.) That way, firefighters can look out for the strobing lights when trying to locate pets in your home. There's even an accompanying sticker you can place on your home's window, so firefighters know you have a pet to look out for.\n\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe device is silent, so as to not scare your pets away from their hiding space. It wouldn't do any good to have a beacon for firefighters to locate your pet, only to have them scurry off because of an alarm. The Rescue Retriever Fire Tag lights up in an emergency\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNew from the company this year is the Fire Tag, which brings the strobe light from the main unit to a small tag you can place on your pet's collar. The tag syncs up to the main unit using RFID. When the main unit detect smoke and starts strobing, the Fire Tag will pick up the signal and follow suit. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's great that the main unit doesn't make a noise to scare your dog, but that doesn't guarantee they will go to the spot where the smoke alarm is installed—maybe the house smoke alarm scares them again or they don't follow their usual pattern and hide somewhere away from where you placed the main unit. Having a Fire Tag on their collar would give firefighters a better shot at locating the pet, wherever they may be in the home. Rescue Retriever tells me these tags have a range of up to a quarter mile, so if your dog runs away from your house, their collar might still light up. Even still, the Fire Tag opens up, allowing you to place a tracker like an AirTag inside, so if your dog runs out of that quarter mile range, you can still track them if they come within Bluetooth range of a device within the Find My network.  Rescue Retriever says the Fire Tag is ready for production, and, when available, can be purchased either individually ($29.99), or as part of a larger bundle with the main Rescue Retriever unit ($89.99). The main unit can be purchased now for $39.99, but it also comes in bundles with accessories for varying prices.\n            \n    ",

It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But keeping track of which applications are using the internet—and how much data they're using—is still useful at times, as is blocking apps from accessing the net entirely.While you're traveling, for example, internet access might be limited, so it's a good idea to cut off applications that constantly churn through data. But even while at home, it's a good security practice to review which applications are connecting to the internet. And while macOS comes with a firewall, it's not really a useful tool for that.Which is why I like FireWally. This totally free application, offered by the Ukraine-based indie Mac developers Nektony, isn't a tool for power users—it's streamlined and user friendly. Click the menu bar icon and you'll see a list of applications using the internet. You can see a summary of all traffic today, in the past hour, or monitor incoming traffic in real time.\nBeside every application is its data usage. You can see a breakdown of inbound and outbound traffic for any application by hovering the mouse over it. You can block any application from accessing the internet by toggling the switch.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWhat if you don't recognize an application? I, traditionally, ended up copying the name of the application and pasting it into a search engine. FireWally tries to save you some time by providing AI-generated summaries of each application using Apple Intelligence (assuming your Mac supports that feature). It's a useful way to quickly remind yourself what a particular application is, or to identify one you don't recognize.It's a very streamlined application, but perfect for anyone hoping to understand a bit more about how much data their various Mac applications are using. Give it a spin if you're looking for a simple firewall application.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.When it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Soundcore\n                    \n    \nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that. WheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel. When I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment. \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Iyaz Akhtar\n                    \n    \nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

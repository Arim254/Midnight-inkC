href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sora-by-openai/id6744034028&ved=2ahUKEwiMpIro6Y-QAxUflokEHWKIGMkQFnoECCcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw16dSqCy43Mucovh1Db1gX3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the number one free app on the iOS App Store</a>. The app makes it possible for users to generate hyper-realistic short-form videos from simple AI prompts. If you find your TikTok or Instagram feeds to feature a few too many posts made by humans, Sora offers you a feed devoid of any manmade content: Everything you see, from <a href=\"https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sora-2-sam-altman-grilling-pikachu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman roasting a Pikachu on the grill</a>, to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/sora-2-first-impressions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">speeches from Martin Luther King Jr. about Xbox Game Pass</a>, is entirely fabricated and generated by the Sora video model. As the kids say, we are so cooked.  </p><p>The implications are distressing, terrifying, and, to this tech editor, nauseating. But it's not just the fact that these videos are lifelike that's setting off my anxieties; it's also the app's \"cameo\" feature, which lets you insert real people into one of these AI concoctions. If you request a video of someone skateboarding across a skyscraper, for example, Sora doesn't have to generate a fake person. Instead, you can ask it to put yourself in the video. If your friends are on the platform, you can instead choose to cast one of them as the skateboarder, too. The same goes for any account that has made their cameo settings public, which is how we got so many unhinged videos of Altman and other OpenAI execs. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>OpenAI is pitching Cameos as a fun way to communicate and share with friends. I, and others like me, see it as a deepfake machine, with the potential to generate videos of anyone doing just about anything. OpenAI would disagree, of course. The company promises it has \"guardrails\" in place designed to prevent generations that are harmful or offensive, as well as the misuse of other people's likenesses. In order to set up a cameo, you need to take a video of yourself while speaking, which gives the video model the information needed to plop you into these short clips. Ideally, you are in control of your cameos: If you don't want other people generating videos of you, you can choose to block them from being made. If you don't like a video someone made with your cameo, you can request that OpenAI delete it from Sora—even if you didn't make the video yourself.</p><p>Despite OpenAI's assurances, I'm not convinced this won't get ugly fast. Still, it's worth it to go over the settings you <em>can</em> adjust to control how your likeness is used (or not used) on Sora.</p><h2 id=\"block-other-sora-users-from-putting-you-in-cameos\">Block other Sora users from putting you in cameos</h2><p><a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12435986-generating-content-with-cameos\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">These settings only apply once you set up your cameo</a>. If you simply use the app to watch videos, there are no settings for you to adjust. However, if you have made a cameo, you can use a few control to limit how it is used.</p><p>To find your cameo settings, open Sora, tap your profile icon in the bottom right, then tap the two-lined menu button in the top right and choose <strong>\"Cameo rules.\"</strong> Here, you can adjust who can use your cameo from the following options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Only me</strong>: No other Sora users can use your cameo.</p></li><li><p><strong>People I approve</strong>: Choose specific Sora users that can use your cameo. </p></li><li><p><strong>Mutuals</strong>: Anyone you follow who follows you back can use your cameo. </p></li><li><p><strong>Everyone</strong>: Anyone on the platform can use your cameo. (I strongly recommend you do <em>not</em> use this option.)</p></li></ul><p>Note that changing these settings will only apply to videos going forward. If you originally allowed mutuals or all users to use your cameo, but you drop down to people you approve, or even just yourself, all previous videos made with your cameo will remain on the platform. </p><p>You also have some granular control over how your cameos are used, as Bill Peebles, head of Sora, <a href=\"https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1974969638300901817\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">announced on X</a>. If you head back to your cameo settings, choose <strong>\"Cameo preferences\"</strong> then <strong>\"Restrictions.\"</strong> Here, you should have the option to enter any restriction you want, which will block others from including those restrictions when using your cameo. For example, you could block people from putting you in political videos, or from saying specific words or phrases. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"delete-other-peoples-videos-that-use-your-cameo\">Delete other people's videos that use your cameo</h2><p>If you see a video that someone made using your cameo and you don't want it on the platform anymore, you can ask OpenAI to delete it. To do so, open the video, then choose \"Report.\" Here, you can request a takedown. OpenAI says it will \"review and take action\" if the video uses your cameo \"against your settings or rules.\" That's a little too vague for my liking, but it's good to know this system is in place if you find yourself in this position. </p><h2 id=\"delete-your-sora-account-to-nuke-all-videos-using-your-cameo\">Delete your Sora account to nuke all videos using your cameo</h2><p>There is a nuclear option as well: delete your Sora account altogether. OpenAI says that any videos that use a cameo attached to a deleted account will also be removed from the platform. They're much more specific with the language here, so I'd imagine this is the best way to guarantee your cameos are not floating around Sora in ways you don't want them to.</p><h2 id=\"there-are-still-a-lot-of-potential-risks\">There are still a lot of potential risks</h2><p>It's great that OpenAI is giving users controls who can use their likeness in Sora videos, but, in my view, it's just not enough. OpenAI created a tool that lets other users <em>seamlessly</em> <em>place you into AI-generated videos</em>. The risk for misuse is simply too great to think of this product as anything other than a deepfake disaster waiting to happen. </p><p>OpenAI says you can request to delete any video that uses your cameo, but what if OpenAI doesn't think the video violates your rules or settings? More concerningly, what happens when someone takes that video off Sora and publishes it on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube instead? Is OpenAI going to track down every company that is hosting the video and demand they delete it? Or could your face, your voice, your entire likeness, be plastered across social media, in a video that isn't even real? OpenAI requires you to record yourself before creating a cameo, but what if someone figures out how to use existing videos of you to create an illegitimate cameo without your permission? All the cameo restrictions and settings in the world won't let you control what happens with <em>those</em> videos. And while OpenAI considers their initial approach to Sora generations \"conservative,\" I've seen some <em>wild</em> stuff on this platform already. If you think users won't find ways to trick the AI into generating videos of you that are offensive, disgusting, or otherwise negative, think again. </p><p>I don't know where we're going from here, but I know one thing: I'll never use the cameo feature on Sora, and I'd encourage you to do the same. If you already have, restrict your settings as much as you're willing to. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

This week's edition of the Out of Touch Adult’s Guide to Kid Culture features a new body slang term, a TikTok prank where AI puts a hobo into your living room, the possible beginning of the AI wars, and a viral video featuring students running a Nazi out of class. There's a lot to eat, so tuck your napkin in your shirt and chow down.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-venus-tummy\">What is a Venus tummy?</h2><p>A \"Venus tummy\" is a slang term for a woman's belly that is a little fat, but not too fat—a little pouch that can be shown off in tight clothing. Like so: </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nxstypxet/status/1969854168665133335\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

I guess older slang terms like zaftig, thicc, stacked, and \"built like a brick shithouse\" are not specific enough, and specificity is important in objectification. If the internet <em>has</em> to objectify women (and it sure seems like it does) at least Venus tummy is based in history and is more positive and healthy than sexualizing being extremely skinny. So yeah, it's a little creepy, but \"a little creepy\" is the best we can hope for these days.</p><h2 id=\"ai-homeless-man-prank\">AI homeless man prank</h2><p>If your child sends you a picture of a homeless person sitting on your couch and asks, \"what should I do?\" don't panic. It's (probably) a prank. The new video trend online is freaking out your parents and other loved ones with an AI-generated image of an unhoused person, then posting a video about it to TikTok, like this:</p><blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and this: </p><blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You might think you're going to be clever and pull a switcheroo on your child, but I warn you, this will not work. They will immediately clock the image as fake, post a sarcastic emoji, and leave you on read, as you can see:</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759534666.png\" alt=\"Text prank\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1759534666.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1759534666.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6P70N3BYRHKY9J307YA8GEA/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759534666.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Stephen Johnson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"two-stories-of-backlash-against-ai\">Two stories of backlash against AI</h2><p>AI is great for generating pictures of people in unfortunate situations on your couch, but the way it's taking over everything worthwhile about humanity is less great. Thankfully, there's evidence that AI destruction of humanity will at least meet token resistance, and that the backlash against artificial intelligence is growing. </p><h3>NYC doesn't want an AI \"Friend\"</h3><p>Back in 2024, the world first learned of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-the-friend-ai-pendant\" target=\"_blank\">\"Friend\" pendant</a>, a little AI device you wear around your neck thats only purpose is to provide a simulation of human interaction. Now that they're actually available to purchase, the company behind them has launched an advertising campaign; it's going extremely poorly. </p><p>In New York City, subway and street posters for the Friend device are being defaced mercilessly and creatively, <a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/003/144/526/38c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">like so</a>, with people scrawling messages like \"<a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/003/144/527/667.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">AI will promote suicide when prompted</a>. It is not your friend\" on them. I'm not exactly pro vandalism, but in this case, I make an exception. </p><h3>Tilly Norwood, the first \"AI actress\"</h3><p>A few days ago, <em>Variety</em> posted a story about <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/ai-actress-tilly-norwood-talent-agents-zurich-summit-1236533454/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Tilly Norwood</a>, an \"AI actress\" whose creator, comedian and producer Eline Van der Velden, lied that he had \"attracted the attention of multiple talent agents\" for Norwood. A creation of \"AI talent studio\" Xicoia, Norwood's first video role is below:</p>\n<p>Apparently, the above video is considered \"funny\" in the UK.  Anyway, soon after Norwood was announced as existing, real talent agencies responded with \"t<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/gersh-ai-actress-tilly-norwood-representation-1236534829/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">he fuck out of here with this dumb shit.</a>\" as did <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sag-aftra-sean-astin-ai-actress-tilly-norwood-1236536540/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SAG, the actors union</a>, and everyone else worthwhile.</p><p>But with her name in public, troubling news of Norwood's past became public, as you can see in this X post:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lunch_enjoyer/status/1972701356193620276\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Created in three and 30 seconds by Stephen Johnson Studios, Extreme has attracted the attention of multiple talent agents for his bad-boy image and his ceaseless rule-breaking. He's an accident looking for a place to happen. Here's his audition video, suckers:</p>\n<p>(If you want to hire Johnny Extreme, please send me money.)</p><h2 id=\"what-does-my-steak-is-too-juicy-mean\">What does \"my steak is too juicy\" mean? </h2><p>The phrases \"my steak is too juicy\" and \"my lobster is too buttery\" are online slang used to suggest someone is complaining about something they should be grateful for.

But they don't give him the beating he's trying to provoke. Instead, they hold him down and wait for the authorities to come and take him away.

The company dropped the first beta for iOS 26.1 on Monday, Sept. 22. Ever since, developers and public testers have been able to try out Apple's next update early. Now, they have another beta version to try: iOS 26.1 beta 2 is officially here.  </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"alarms-are-harder-to-accidentally-dismiss\">Alarms are harder to accidentally dismiss</h2><p>This is a feature new to the second iOS 26.1 beta. As of this version, Apple now makes it harder to dismiss a ringing alarm, which means the risk you'll accidentally oversleep goes down. </p><p>You still have the same \"Snooze\" button as you do on the official iOS 26 build: If all you want is another nine minutes of sleep, this button is as easy to tap as ever. However, to dismiss the alarm entirely, you can't simply tap a button anymore. Instead, you need to <a href=\"https://x.com/BetaProfiles/status/1975277154801000664\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">slide to stop the alarm</a>. You might remember this gesture from the iPhone's early days, when you needed to \"Slide to Unlock\" your phone. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1975277154801000664\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"live-translation-languages\">Live Translation languages</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translation</a> for AirPods is a fantastic new feature that automatically translates conversations you're having with someone who speaks a language you don't understand. So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"transparent-navigation-buttons-in-the-photos-app\">Transparent navigation buttons in the Photos app</h2><p>Similarly, with beta 2, Apple brought back transparent navigation buttons in the Photos app. These had been present earlier on in iOS 26's beta testing, but Apple made the buttons more opaque for the official release. Now, you'll be able to see what's behind each button as you move around the app. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1975268986825883933\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"color-coded-calendar-list\">Color-coded calendar list</h2><p>Whenever you have Calendar in List view in iOS 26.1, you'll see your daily events color-coded by their respective calendars, rather than simply listed against the same white background.</p><h2 id=\"references-to-third-party-smartwatch-support\">References to third-party smartwatch support</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, you know the only smartwatch that <em>really</em> works well with it is the Apple Watch. Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p><h2 id=\"apple-brings-back-slide-over-multitasking-ipados\">Apple brings back Slide Over multitasking (iPadOS)</h2><p>If you're running the second iPadOS 26.1 beta on your iPad, you'll notice a familiar feature: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/ipados-26-1-slide-over-multitasking/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Slide Over</a>. Slide Over is a multitasking feature that lets you open and hide an iOS-like window on the side of your iPad. This window is overlaid on top of your other active windows, and is meant to offer an at-a-glance view of another app, without needing to take up a dedicated space on-screen. </p><p>This feature was especially useful when the iPad's multitasking was in its infancy. It seems Apple thought Slide Over's days were done, however, as the company removed the feature with iOS 26. Instead, you get an improved macOS-like windows management system. It's not clear why Apple brought the feature back with beta 2, and it's possible it could disappear again before iPadOS 26.1's official release. But for now, you can take advantage of the new multitasking system <em>and</em> Slide Over with this newest beta. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

Some of Garmin's newest watches are on sale for the first time ever, including the Vivoactive 6 and the Venu X1. You can also catch deals on Fitbits and on some older models of Apple and Samsung watches. Here’s what I’ve found so far. </p><h2 id=\"garmin\">Garmin</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxxRbk?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vivoactive%206&short_url=QxxRbk&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Vivoactive%206\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Vivoactive 6</u></a> is on sale for what I believe is the first time ever, for $249.99 down from the original $299.99. The Vivoactive line <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmins-vivoactive-6-smartwatch-review\" target=\"_blank\">is Garmin’s most underrated</a>: It’s a great casual fitness watch with the accurate GPS and heart rate that you’d expect from a Garmin. It also has coached walking workouts, a smart alarm, and wheelchair fitness settings. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7ML0V?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Venu%20X1&short_url=z7ML0V&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Venu%20X1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Venu X1</u></a> is also on a rare sale, $699.99 down from the original price of $799.99. This new smartwatch is Garmin’s answer to the Apple Watch Ultra, with a large rectangular display, sapphire glass, and built-in maps for navigation. Unlike its Apple counterpart, it has an LED flashlight and the battery lasts up to eight days. </p><p>Among older Garmin watches, the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5XOrL?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Venu%20Sq%202&short_url=a5XOrL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Venu%20Sq%202\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Venu Sq 2</u></a>, released in 2022, is on sale for $149.99, down from a list price of $249.99. (It was originally sold for $299.99.) This is a great budget option for a casual fitness watch, especially if you like the square screen format.</p><h2 id=\"apple\">Apple</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9l2rDx?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GPS-only%20version%20of%20the%20Apple%20Watch%20SE&short_url=9l2rDx&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=GPS-only%20version%20of%20the%20Apple%20Watch%20SE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>GPS-only version of the Apple Watch SE</u></a> is $179.99, down from $249.99. This is the second-generation of the SE, launched in 2022. It’s a great budget pick if you don’t want to splurge on a newer or fancier Apple Watch. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aBDYEB?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Series%2010%20Apple%20Watch&short_url=aBDYEB&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Series%2010%20Apple%20Watch\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Series 10 Apple Watch</u></a> is also discounted, starting at $329.99 for the GPS-only version, down from $399.99. This is last year’s mid-range Apple Watch, which our editor Michelle Ehrhardt crowned the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-watch-series-10-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>best Apple Watch for most people</u></a>. This year’s release, the Series 11, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/i-love-my-apple-watch-series-11-but-you-might-not\" target=\"_blank\"><u>is only a mild upgrade</u></a>. If you go for the Series 10 instead, you’re only missing out on tougher glass, a 5G modem, and a somewhat improved battery life. The Series 10 is worth considering if you don’t need those extra features. </p><h2 id=\"samsung\">Samsung</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aRM6EV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Galaxy%20Watch%207&short_url=aRM6EV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Galaxy%20Watch%207\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Galaxy Watch 7</u></a> is on sale starting at $199.99 today, normally $249.99. This watch is the slightly older model, since it was replaced with the Galaxy Watch 8 earlier this year. But it’s still a solid pick for an Android smartwatch. The $199.99 price is for the smaller size with Bluetooth-only connectivity, but both sizes and both connectivity styles (Bluetooth or LTE) are all on sale for around $50 off. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QmObdn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=titanium%20gray%20color%20of%20the%20Galaxy%20Watch%20Ultra&short_url=QmObdn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=titanium%20gray%20color%20of%20the%20Galaxy%20Watch%20Ultra\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>titanium gray color of the Galaxy Watch Ultra</u></a> (released this year) is on sale for $599.99, down from $649.99. Other colors still seem to be full price. </p><h2 id=\"fitbit\">Fitbit</h2><p>Fitbit’s best basic fitness tracker, the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zj7dxv?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Charge%206&short_url=zj7dxv&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Charge%206\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Charge 6</u></a>, is on sale today for $119.95, down from $159.95. I like the Charge 6 as a no-nonsense tracker, great for somebody who just wants step and activity tracking without having to think about it too much. (That said, if you want a bigger screen or more features, check out the Garmins I mentioned above.) I have <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fitbit-charge-6-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a review of the Charge 6</u></a> if you’d like to learn more.</p>\n<p>The  <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxxRrY?pageview_type=Standard&template=Deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Inspire%203&short_url=QxxRrY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness-trackers-smartwatches-october-prime-day-2025&event_label=Inspire%203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Inspire 3</u></a> is also on sale for $79.95, down from $99.95. It doesn’t have its own GPS, and the screen is smaller.

It's a signifier of my progression through Club Peloton, a new member recognition program that comes with some solid rewards.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-club-peloton\">What is Club Peloton?</h2><p>Club Peloton is a new ranking system that's meant to reflect a person's efforts and participation with Peloton workouts. Progress is applied retroactively (good news for my 201-day streak) which means I've achieved the rank of Silver III. The ranks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Silver (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Gold (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Champion</p></li><li><p>Legend</p></li></ul><p>Within each of the first three ranks, there are three tiers, and Champion and Legend each stand alone, so there are 11 levels to work through overall. </p><p>Importantly, you can never be demoted on Club Peloton; you can only move up. If you miss a week's worth of workouts while you're in Bronze III, you won't log in to find that you've been bumped down to Bronze II. It's meant to encourage you, not shame you. </p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-earn-points\">How do you earn points?</h2><p>The purpose of this new ranking system is to encourage members, make people try new things, and give recognition and rewards to participants. The methods of earning points demonstrate that. Here's what you can do to rise the ranks:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Earn two points for each day you work out with Peloton, whether using the company's equipment, its app, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strength+.</a></p></li><li><p>Earn points corresponding to your weekly streaks, so three points for a three-week streak, etc. If you work out two weeks in a row, you'll get two points. If you work out 40 weeks in a row, that week is going to end with a 40-point boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for yearly streaks, too. If you work out 52 weeks in a row, you end up with a year-long streak, which earns you double points. Instead of 52 points at the end of that year, you get 104. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for milestones. Milestones can be found on your Peloton profile and include things like taking 10 or 25 of a certain kind of class. When you achieve a milestone in a second activity beyond one you've already got one in, you get a 10% boost. Milestones in three or more give you a 20% boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for participating in programs. Every week you are actively involved in one, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton's FTP program</a>, you get two points. You get one point for every class you complete in your new, AI-generated personal plan and 10 points any time you undertake a Peloton challenge. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for being a team player. Every week, you can earn up to one point each for giving someone a virtual high five during class, taking a live class, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a Team</a>. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-are-the-ranks-calculated\">How are the ranks calculated?</h2><p>Want to know how many points are required to raise your rank? Here's the breakdown:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze is your level if you have zero to 99 points.</p></li><li><p>Silver is for 100 to 1,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Gold covers 2,000 points to 14,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Champion is 15,000 to 29,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Legend is for anyone with over 30,000 points.</p></li></ul><p>Like I said, I'm on a daily streak that stretches almost two-thirds of a year and I'm only in Silver III with just 1,205 points and 795 to go until I hit Gold I. You can tap into your point history to see a breakdown of how you got to where you are. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-all-this\">What is the point of all this?</h2><p>To me, this is awesome, but I am a well-known lover of all manner of streak-based app gimmicks.

You can get early access to new classes or challenges, discounts on apparel or other retail goods, instructor shoutouts during class, and invitations to exclusive in-person events. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

On the surface, it does sound pretty invasive, especially from a company that typically promotes user privacy. While this really is a new feature, here's the thing: It isn't as bad as it sounds. And, if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.</p><p>The feature, \"Visited Places,\" is actually intended to be a private way to keep tabs on the places you've been to, and to easily recall your favorites in the future. When the feature is enabled, Maps will take note of places you visit, even if you don't use Maps to get there. It's like a passive, automatic journal, taking note of restaurants, malls, parks, or simply general locations you venture to day-to-day. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-mange-visited-places-iph0c2597c4f/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According to Apple</a>, all of this information is stored on your synced devices only, and is end-to-end encrypted, which means Apple has no way to access this data. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>If you have the feature enabled, you'll find your Visited Places appropriately tucked away in the \"Places\" menu when you launch Maps. I've only had the feature turned on for a day or so, so I only have three locations currently saved, but all three were destinations I visited without using Maps to guide me there. </p><p>Personally, I have no issue with keeping this setting turned on: Nobody has access to the data except for me, and I can imagine it reminding me of the places I've enjoyed visiting during a future scroll.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says you will be asked to turn on the feature when you open Maps after updating to iOS 26, and, in my experience, that was the case. However, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-iphones-maps-app-is-tracking-you-in-ios-26-heres-how-to-stop-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for CNET writer Zachary McAuliffe</a>, the feature was already enabled without his input. As such, it might be smart to double-check that the feature is set to whichever setting you prefer, lest you allow Maps to track your movements without your knowledge. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-visited-places-in-apple-maps\">How to manage 'Visited Places' in Apple Maps  </h2><p>To check whether the feature is turned on or off, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Maps > Location</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Maps</strong>. Either way, check the toggle next to \"Visited Places.\" </p><p>You can also delete any Visited Places without needing to turn the feature off altogether. Open Maps, tap \"Places,\" then \"Visited Places.\" Here, you can swipe left on any place to delete it, or choose \"Clear History\" to delete them all. Plus, you can choose how long you want Maps to store your Visited Places: The default is \"Forever,\" but you can also select \"3 Months\" or \"1 Year,\" if you wish. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Early access was initially reserved to a waitlist of Perplexity Max users, a subscription that costs $200 per <em>month</em>, before Perplexity opened up access to Perplexity Pro users, who only need to pay $20 per month. Still, seeing as most web browsers are free to use, I imagine most people still shied away from trying Comet because of the price.</p><p>If that sounds like you, there's good news. On Friday, Perplexity made Comet available to anyone who wants to try it for free. You don't need to subscribe to any Perplexity plan, nor do you even need a Perplexity account—though the company has some features tied to those who sign in. Comet is built on Chromium, so if you're coming from Chrome, or another Chromium browser like Edge, you'll be able to jump right in. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Installing Comet is as easy as any other web browser: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">just head to Perplexity's website</a>, and choose \"Download Comet.\" Even setting up the browser feels familiar, as you can import another Chrome profile, choose a profile pic, and set a name. But of course, the real advertised advantage here is the AI assistant. Like other AI-powered browsers, Comet has a built-in chatbot you can talk to about whatever it is you want—particularly the web pages you happen to be browsing. But Comet's AI is agentic, which means you can ask the AI to do things for you. </p><p>If you ask it to take you to a specific website, it will (though I'm not sure that's any faster than simply typing in the site by hand). If you ask it to open a specific link on the page, you can see the bot take over the page, and choose the URL you asked for. For example, I asked the assistant to open Lifehacker, then asked it to click on our article \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-browse-the-dark-web\" target=\"_blank\">How to Browse the Dark Web</a>.\" It did both of these things, and even offered a summary of the dark web piece.  </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But Perplexity says you can also request more complex tasks: According to the company, the assistant can draft emails on your behalf, build websites, make purchases, create citations, add to your calendar. There's even a voice mode, as with other AI bots like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-is-out-now\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/gemini-live-is-now-available-to-all-android-users-for-free\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, so you can talk to the browser if you want to. </p><p>I'm still not sold on the idea that injecting agentic AI into my web browser is what I need to better experience the internet. Maybe I need to spend some time with Comet to experience that \"future.\" But seeing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+hallucination+lifehacker&udm=14\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">how often the tech still makes mistakes</a>—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/prompt-injection-attacks-ai-browsers\" target=\"_blank\">not the mention the untapped security risks</a>—I'm not sure I want to hand off all of my browsing tasks to AI just yet. Still, if you're interested, you can give it a go without spending a dime.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

/><p>Do you want to learn the material you’re studying—like, <em>really </em>learn it? I'm not talking about learning enough to pass a test, but rather, learning enough that you know it for life. Then what you need to do is <em>overlearn</em> it. One learning theory suggests that if you overlearn, you’ll attain automaticity, or the ability to do something without having to think about it, and ultimately retain more knowledge. Here’s what overlearning is and how to do it.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-overlearning\">What is overlearning?</h2><p>You know something is serious when the <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/overlearning\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">American Psychological Association has a definition for it</a>, and that’s the case here: Per the APA, overlearning is “practice that is continued beyond the point at which the individual knows or performs the task as well as can be expected.” The APA says the benefits here can include “increased persistence of the learning over time or better retention and memory.” The terminology makes sense; once you've learned something <em>over</em> the extent you need to, it becomes second nature. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Simply put, overlearning involves studying something even once you’re sure you know it, which is why this technique is overlooked and, if I'm being honest, a little annoying. It makes sense that once you get information down, you don't want to seemingly waste time going over it, but according to this theory, that is, unfortunately, when the magic happens. Don’t stop reviewing or studying just because you succeeded in memorizing something. Instead, keep going, digging it deeper and deeper into your brain.</p><p>Hermann Ebbinghaus, the researcher who brought us the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-beat-the-forgetting-curve-while-studyi-1850791645\" target=\"_blank\">Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</a>, studied memory in the 1890s, figuring out that as time passed, memories decreased. (That’s basically what the forgetting curve is all about and a pretty common-sense phenomenon you have certainly experienced in your own life.) According to him, overlearning happens when you keep repeating what you’re going over well past the point at which you can recall it with 100% accuracy. Think about a story you've told numerous times over your lifetime. If you hadn't started reciting it at parties and on first dates, the details may have gotten fuzzy, but since you did, it's practically a well-rehearsed performance at this point. </p><p>See, <em>recalling </em>it is something that takes effort. The goal of overlearning is to reach automaticity, <a href=\"https://cirl.etoncollege.com/dont-just-learn-emoverlearn-em/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">pulling the information from your longterm memory</a> with no effort and freeing up space in your working memory.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-overlearn\">How do you overlearn?</h2><p>The next time you’re studying, review material you already know front to back. For instance, when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">using the Leitner method</a> (which involves spaced repetition of flash cards, the frequency of review of each depending on how well you did the last time you quizzed yourself on it), always review all the flashcards you’re assigned on a particular day, even if you feel like skipping them because you got them right last time. Repeatedly going over material you know well is the key to overlearning and eventual automatic recall.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Flashcards, in general, are a great way to study and they're perfect for this, especially if you're following the Leitner technique. Just because a flashcard has been moved into the section you study less frequently doesn't mean you should never go back to it. In fact, if you're trying to overlearn, it's one of the only times I'd recommend not using Leitner—at least not right away. For the first few days of reviewing your cards, go through all of them and don't sort them by whether you get the answers right or wrong. Just keep drilling the same information over and over again.</p><p>Another useful tool here is the practice of blurting, which is what we call it when you write down or say everything you can remember about a topic. That <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">forces active recall</a>—or the act of consciously yanking information out of your long-term memory—and trains you to quickly identify key details in your brain. At the end of every week, do a round of blurting, even if you nailed all the details last time around.</p><p>Schedule blocks of time in your week for reviewing materials you’ve already mastered when you're <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">pre-planning your distributed practice</a>. This can be as easy as re-reading a chapter or your notes, or as complex as taking practice quizzes or using flashcards. Continually reintroducing familiar ideas to yourself will dig them deeper into your longterm memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

officially announced a number of smart home initiatives</a>. <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-nest-cams-home-speaker-walmart/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new

href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/google-home-app-gemini-redesign/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">redesigned Google Home app</a>. As you might expect in 2025, Google's new smart home strategy is powered by the company's AI, Gemini, with a new branding to boot: <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/gemini-for-home-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Gemini for Home</a>. </p><p>The company is making a lot of claims for how its next-generation tech will improve your <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/series/a-guide-to-automating-your-entire-home\" target=\"_blank\">smart home</a>. We'll need to wait for the reviewers to put Gemini and the new Google Home app through their paces, not to mention all of Google's new devices, but until then, we can take a peek at the future Google is selling us on: </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"gemini-for-home\">Gemini for Home</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1128.v1759334369.webp\" alt=\"screenshots of gemini for home\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_800x451.v1759334369.webp 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_1400x790.v1759334369.webp 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1128.v1759334369.webp 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Google Assistant is nothing new, but even Google seems to think there's been room for improvement. The company says the experience was \"functional, not intuitive or natural,\" which seems to be informing Google's newest smart home assistant: Gemini for Home.</p><p>As you might expect, Gemini is replacing Google Assistant across all Google smart home products. The company's argument here is that the new experience is much more natural than before: Previously, you might have needed to ensure your commands were succinct and to the point for the assistant to understand them. Going forward, Google says you can take advantage of the AI's contextual awareness for more casual requests. </p><p>If you're asking for help fixing your dishwasher, for example, you don't need to preface each request with the problem at hand. You can begin with a question like \"Hey Google, my dishwasher is having trouble draining. Where should I start?\" If it suggests you check the filter, you don't need to say \"Hey Google, I'm trying to get my dishwasher to drain, but the filter seems fine. What's the next step?\" Instead, you can simply follow up with \"Hey Google, the filter seems fine. What's next?\" Google says Gemini will understand the context, and continue to help. </p><p>If you want to bypass the the constant \"Hey Googles,\" you can say \"Hey Google, let's chat.\" This kicks on Gemini Live, the AI's voice mode, which let's you have a back and forth with Gemini. </p><p>The company says you can do the same when asking questions about things like songs and movies. If you want to look up a song from a movie, but you don't remember the name of either, you can share vague details about the movie and Gemini supposedly can put the pieces together.    </p><p>Perhaps most importantly for the smart home itself, Google says Gemini can handle more complex requests. For example, you can ask it to turn off all lights except for a specific room, or trust that the AI will understand the context of the room you're asking about, e.g., \"Can you turn on the lights by the oven\" will mean turning on the lights in the kitchen. My favorite of Google's promised features, however, is that you can ask Gemini to add items to your grocery lists from recipes, rather than individual items. You can simply request a shopping list for Pad Thai, and, according to Google, Gemini will add all the ingredients necessary to your shopping list.</p><h2 id=\"gemini-with-smart-cameras\">Gemini with smart cameras</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334447.png\" alt=\"google smart cameras\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_800x434.v1759334447.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_1400x759.v1759334447.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334447.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Google says Gemini for Home can also upgrade smart cameras connected to Google Home. The company argues that most smart camera alerts are \"low context,\" pinging you with things like \"motion detected\" or \"person detected,\" but leaving the rest on you to figure out what's really going on. </p><p>With Gemini for Home, Google says it is using AI to make your smart camera experience more contextual. Alerts will offer a \"full narrative of what's happening,\" so you can learn from the notification itself whether you have a USPS delivery, or simply a shadow moving in front of the camera. Gemini will also  organize and summarize all of the day's video clips—you can choose whether to review all the videos taken, or simply scan the summary for any updates the AI thought important. Google says you can ask Gemini questions about your clips, as well. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Speaking of which, you can ask Gemini to find specific video clips using natural language. Google says you can ask questions like \"When did the kids get home,\" or \"Did I leave the car door open today?\"</p><h2 id=\"the-new-google-home-app\">The new Google Home app</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334506.png\" alt=\"google home app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_800x434.v1759334506.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_1400x759.v1759334506.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334506.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Tying all these updates together is the overhauled Google Home app, which reportedly has over 100 new features and performance improvements. Google says there were three goals in mind with this particular update: \"Make it faster, more reliable, and complete.\"</p><p>To that first point, the app should perform quite well, if the company is to be believed. Google claims its new Home app is over 70% faster on some Android devices than before, with crashes down by almost 80%, while smart camera live views supposedly load 30% faster with 40% fewer playback failures. </p><p>The new design comes with three main tabs: There's the Home tab, which is where you see all of the controls for your smart home devices. Within this tab, there are swipeable menus for things like Favorites and devices. Next, there's the Activity tab, which contains your home's activity history. You can see when a routine was started, when motion was detected on a camera, and when a light was turned off. Finally, there's the Automations tab: You can see which automations are coming up, access your entire automations collection, and create new automations as well.  </p><p>Google has also integrated \"the best\" of the Nest app into the new Home app. While the dedicated Nest app is still available, Google clearly intends for Nest functionality to live here long-term. That includes support for Nest Thermostats from 2015 on, as well as Nest Protect smoke and CO emergency alerts and Nest x Yale Lock passcode management. Google says the experience of controlling previous Nest devices is also enhanced in the new app, with higher frame rates and faster loading times.</p><p>Finally, there's \"Ask Home,\" a new Gemini-powered feature that aims to make it easy to find any element of your smart home. For example, Google says you can type things like \"lights\" or \"living room\" to find deices and automations related to those queries. You can look up clips from your smart cameras, stack multiple smart home commands together, or create an automation with natural language.  </p><p>Google says all of these changes are rolling out today, Wednesday, Oct. 1 around the globe. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Google doesn't have the best track record when it comes to user privacy, but every once in a while, they do something surprising. Back in April, the company <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">began testing end-to-end encrypted email messaging</a> for enterprise users. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/send-gmail-end-to-end-encrypted-emails-in-gmail.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">it officially rolled out the feature</a>. If you have a Google Workspace through work, you should now be able to send emails protected by E2EE, even if you're sending the email outside of Gmail. That should make it possible to send emails that only you, the recipient, and the IT department that manages your account can access. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/texts-may-not-be-secure-says-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">E2EE is essential</a> for anyone who wants to ensure that their communications are totally private. To simplify a complex technology, encrypting something like an email essentially means scrambling all of the code into something completely unrecognizable. In order to unscramble it, you need a \"key.\" In the case of Gmail's E2EE, you have a key, the recipient has a key, and whoever manages your Google Workspace account has a key. The keys to decrypt these emails aren't saved on Google's servers, so even Google should have no way to access your encrypted emails. You can send things like sensitive company information or medical information protected by HIPAA without worrying about prying eyes intercepting the message.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The only bummer here is that E2EE in Gmail is restricted to business accounts at this time. That said, there is a way to send more secure messages over a standard Gmail account—just don't expect E2EE-level protections.</p><h2 id=\"e2ee-for-enterprise-gmail-users\">E2EE for enterprise Gmail users</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg\" alt=\"google e2ee messaging\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759517385.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1759517385.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>In order to send E2EE emails through your enterprise Gmail account, you need to ensure your Workspace admin turns it on. Once they do, you'll need to tell Gmail you want to send your email with E2EE. To do so, open Gmail, and choose \"Compose\" to start a new email. Choose \"Message security,\" then, under \"Additional encryption,\" choose \"Turn on.\" From here, you can compose your message as you normally would, adding your recipients to the list. </p><p>If your recipient is another Google Workspace user, the message will automatically be decrypted when it reaches their inbox. If they aren't a Gmail user, they won't be able to decrypt the email in their client. Instead, they'll receive a link that opens a \"restricted\" version of Gmail. Once they sign in, the message will decrypt, and they'll be able to read and respond to it from this restricted window. Note that IT departments can choose to have all E2EE messages open in restricted Gmail windows, even if the recipients are Google Workspace users.</p><h2 id=\"use-confidential-mode-to-send-secure-messages-for-free\">Use confidential mode to send \"secure\" messages for free</h2><p>If you don't have an enterprise account, there really isn't any way to send E2EE emails through Gmail. For that, you'd need a dedicated encrypted email service, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/proton-unlimited-review-worth-it-vpn-password-manager-secure-email\" target=\"_blank\">like Proton</a>. However, you can add an extra layer of security to your messages before you send them out. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>To do so, start a new email in Gmail, then choose \"Confidential mode\" from the options. This mode blocks recipients from forwarding, copying, printing, or downloading the email. You can also choose to have the message expire after a set period of time—including one day, one week, one month, three months, or five years—as well as password protect the email. If you choose the latter, Gmail will automatically generate a password and send it to the recipients via SMS. </p><p>These added protections are certainly helpful when sending sensitive information over Gmail, but they're imperfect. Again, this is not end-to-end encryption, which means it's possible to intercept and read messages sent this way. More practically, there's nothing stopping users from taking photos of the message with another device—though the same could be said with E2EE messages.</p><p>Unless you have an enterprise account, I'd avoid sending anything too important via Gmail at this time. You're better off using a dedicated E2EE platform, like Signal, WhatsApp, or iMessage.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

If you enter your debit or credit card into one of these fake card readers, your data is stored for later download or transmitted wirelessly in real time to a device controlled by scammers, who will use the information to steal from your accounts. Unfortunately, online shoppers aren't immune from this scheme. Web skimming is a type of cyberattack that uses malicious code to steal card data during checkout, and researchers have identified an ongoing campaign targeting major payment providers and, by extension, consumers. Online credit card skimmingWeb skimming attacks, broadly referred to as \"Magecart\" campaigns, are initiated when malicious JavaScript is injected into e-commerce websites and payment portals. When a checkout page loads, the skimmer replaces it with a spoofed form that collects card numbers, expiry dates, card verification codes, and billing or shipping addresses—everything threat actors need to turn around and use your card for fraudulent purchases. \nThe fake payment forms use legitimate-looking branding and styling to minimize suspicion. Once payment details are transmitted to the attacker, the user gets an error message and is redirected to the real checkout page, a flow designed to make you believe that you've simply entered your information incorrectly. Web skimmers are typically designed to avoid detection and may even self-destruct, making them difficult to identify even for site admins. They also utilize bulletproof hosting, which shields cyber actors from takedown requests and law enforcement action. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect your payment cardUnfortunately, consumers can't do much about the presence of web skimmers, but they can play defense against them. Red flags of an online shopping scam are also red flags for skimming—for example, deals and discounts that are too good to be true are indicators of a possible fraudulent vendor or malicious site, where you may be more likely to have your card details stolen. Shopping with reputable vendors will reduce (though not entirely eliminate) the risk. You should also be vigilant about any unusual steps during checkout, such as redirects or error messages, and abandon any suspicious transactions. If you suspect that your payment details may have been stolen, keep an eye on your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized activity, and enable transaction alerts for real-time updates. Remember that credit cards offer more security protections than debit cards. You could also use virtual cards for online purchases, which allows you to keep your actual card details private and protect you from further fraud. (Note, however, that virtual cards have some drawbacks. For example, you may lose some protections offered by your primary card provider and have a tougher time obtaining refunds.)\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        As someone who regularly switches between the Mac and PC, I really can't live without the PowerToys app on Windows. It adds little missing features that I really like on the Mac, like a Spotlight Search alternative, auto dark mode, screen awake, on-screen OCR (which lets you pull text from images), and more.But the reverse is also true. When I'm on MacOS, I start to miss the little features and commands that I've been used to Windows having for decades now (I started using Windows in school, but was only exposed to macOS when I was in college).It's the little things, like not being able to cut and paste files in Finder. And why must I accidentally open the Music app every time I press the play button? This is just the beginning.\nEnter Supercharge, a utility from prolific indie developer Sindre Sorhus. Think of it not as a single app, but as a Swiss army knife for your menu bar—a collection of micro-utilities designed to patch the specific usability holes that Apple has left open, many of which Microsoft has already plugged. The app offers an unlimited free trial (with a prompt to upgrade every 12 hours), or you can buy it outright for $18. It's also available as part of a Setapp subscription. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Supercharge\n                    \n    \nThe best Supercharge tweaks that you should enableThe Supercharge app works in two ways. The first is by giving you a set-and-forget settings menu. Secondly, it adds a menu bar app where you can quickly access small features on the fly.The tweaks part, to me, is a lot more interesting. Once the app is installed, open the menu bar app and go to Settings. Go to the Tweaks tab and take some time to customize your Mac's behavior.Make Finder work more like Windows File Explorer\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe Finder is where Supercharge shines, fixing legacy behaviors that have frustrated Windows switchers for years. The first thing I enabled was the \"Cut and Paste\" functionality. Finally, you can use Cmd+X to cut a file and Cmd+V to move it, eliminating the awkward Cmd+C followed by Cmd+Option+V dance required by default.Beyond moving files, the app allows you to enable the Option+N shortcut to instantly create a new text file in your current folder—another Windows muscle memory I've had for decades. Additional tweaks include toggling the Enter key to open a file instead of renaming it, and an option to show hidden files by default.Mission Control featuresApple's Mission Control provides a bird's-eye view of all your windows, but it's hardly interactive. Supercharge changes that by adding window management buttons directly to the overlay. You can now add dedicated Close, Minimize, and Quit buttons for every window inside Mission Control, helping you clear cluttered app windows in seconds, and in a fairly visual way.Dock enhancementsSupercharge also brings much-needed flexibility to the Dock, making it more like the taskbar on Windows or Linux. Enable the Click-to-Hide feature, and you can minimize or hide an app simply by clicking on the app icon. My favorite, though, is the option to open folders directly in the Finder from the Dock. You can also set Supercharge to add spacers to the Dock, and quit apps using the middle-click mouse button.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Apple Music app fixPerhaps the most useful fix in the entire suite is the ability to stop Apple Music from launching automatically. This feature stops the app from popping up when you press Play on your keyboard or Bluetooth headphones. If you are a dedicated Spotify user or simply dislike it when your headphones accidentally wake up Apple Music, this feature alone makes a Supercharge installation worth it.Other useful featuresThe Supercharge app includes several other quality-of-life improvements. The Notification Nuke feature allows you to set a global hotkey to instantly clear all notifications from Notification Center, acting as a panic button for focus. To prevent accidents, you can also enable Accidental Quit Prevention, which requires a double-press or a Shift + Cmd + Q combo to actually quit an application.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nThe second part of the equation here is the menu bar app. Here, you can add small missing features that usually require downloading separate apps. There are more than two dozen options. Go to Settings > General > Show Menu Items to see the whole list.Here, you can add options to quickly capture and copy any text from an image (or translate it). There are one-click options for hiding all windows, showing the desktop, quitting all apps except the current one, clearing all notifications, and more. There's also a simple Keep Awake feature that will keep your Mac active even when the screen is off. And there's also a simple default browser switcher built-in, though I prefer using Sindre's dedicated Default Browser app.\n            ",

That was due to Verizon's nationwide outage, which affected roughly two million customers across the United States. If you were among them, you couldn't use your phone on the go, which is sort of the idea behind cellphones in general. This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send work emails or messages, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or perhaps because of it), the company seems keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced it had resolved the outage, it also said it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowVerizon made a post on X, once again apologizing for the outage and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive. If you're among them, Verizon says they will text you when the credit is available. When it is, you can log into the myVerizon app to claim your recompense.        \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

They're also often low quality, AI-generated, misinformation, or some combination of the bunch, and may have a negative impact on our attention spans and mental health. In short, they're just not that good for us. It's bad enough for grown adults to control their scrolling habits, but it's another thing entirely for children, which poses quite the a challenge.It's easy enough to ban short-form video apps entirely, like TikTok. But what about apps that have short-form content as just one pillar of the overall package? Take YouTube: You might not mind your child having limited access to the app or site to watch long-form content you approve of, but having Shorts always in the way throws a wrench in that system. Any type of short-form video feed would be an issue here, but YouTube Shorts is particularly egregious, allowing kids to watch some truly horrific content, often generated by AI. Choosing whether your kids watch YouTube ShortsLuckily, YouTube finally appears to be giving parents some control here. As spotted by TechCrunch, YouTube announced updates to its parental controls on Wednesday. While there are a few changes on the way, the headline for me concerns Shorts. Not only will YouTube let parents choose a timer for how often their kids can watch Shorts, they can choose to set the timer to zero—effectively blocking Shorts for their kids' and teens' accounts. \nThis should be welcome news to any parents struggling to limit the short-form video content their kids are watching. You can let them watch other types of videos on YouTube Kids, or even standard YouTube if its a teen account, without worrying about them going down short-form video rabbit holes for hours. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe control here can be even more granular than an outright ban, too. Since you're always in control of the timer, YouTube says you can customize timers based on the scenario: You could set the Shorts timer to zero during homework time, then offer 30 minutes of scrolling after dinner. You could bump that to 60 minutes on weekends, or when in the car. If your child is under a supervised account, you'll also be able to control both custom Bedtime and \"Take a Break\" reminders. This is not the first time YouTube has offered users more control over Shorts. Last week, the company rolled out a new search filter that lets you choose to only see long-form videos in any given result, and since October, you've been able to limit the number of shorts you can watch in a day. YouTube, and parent company Google, are also expanding parental controls and enhancing protections for kids and teens. YouTube now uses AI to guess your age, and, if it believes you're under 18, will add restrictions to your account. Google also gives parents more control over supervised accounts: Previously, teens could choose to remove supervision after turning 13, but now, they need their parents to sign off on it too.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's my favorite of the lot, and right now, you can get a sweet bundle with the XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro portable projector and the PowerBase Stand (which you do honestly need) for $368.99, down from $500 at release. This is its all-time low price, according to price-tracking tools.  \nThe projector has two ports—a USB and a micro HDMI—so you can project from a laptop or phone, or you can simply screen mirror from your devices via the Google TV OS. Also, since the projector is \"smart,\" it already comes with the typical apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon, and you can download more from the Google Play Store and control it with a remote. With 450 lumens and 1080p, it's best used in dark rooms, but you can get away with some ambient light (I make good use of it in my backyard).Where this projector truly shines is with the auto keystone focus feature. If you move it anywhere, it'll autocorrect to make the image look its best, regardless of where it's set up. It's user-friendly and made to be set up quickly, without a lot of fiddling. It also comes with a powerful 5W Harman Kardon speaker, which sounds great—about on par with a speaker like the Echo Dot.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOne caveat: This projector has no internal battery, which is a huge bummer. You'd need to use a portable charger, plug it into an outlet, or, if you're getting it in this bundle, the PowerBase Stand, which can deliver 2.5 hours of battery life. (If you plan to use it mostly indoors, you can choose just the projector for $318.99.)\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And even after bringing your apps together, you usually had to tell Gemini where to look for your data to get much use out of its abilities. For Instance, if you wanted it to pull information from your emails, you might have started a prompt with \"Search my email.\" Now, Google is making it easier to connect Gemini to its various services, and adding \"reasoning\" when pulling context from across your Google Workspace. It's calling the feature \"Personal Intelligence.\"Rolling out in beta for paid subscribers in the U.S. today (and coming to other countries and free users \"soon\"), Personal Intelligence is an opt-in feature that currently works with Gmail, Photos, YouTube, and Search, all of which you can connect in one tap while setting up the feature.\nThat alone makes it more convenient than a collection of extensions, but there are supposedly a few upgrades to general usability as well. The biggest is that Gemini will apparently be able to \"learn\" about you from a grab bag of sources all at once, without you having to specify where to look, and use that information to answer your questions.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIn an example, Google has a user say \"I need to replace the tires for my car. Which ones would you suggest for me?\" The bot then runs through multiple reasoning steps, pulling from all the data available to it, to find out what car the prompter drives and which tires would be best for it in the conditions the prompter tends to drive in. Specifically, in the example, it references actual vacations the prompter had taken in the past, using Google Photos data, while also using Gmail data to help the prompter find their car's specific trim. This can take a while, which is why there's an \"Answer now\" button next to the reasoning progress bar to stop the bot from getting stuck. In the example, it took about 10 seconds for the AI to generate a response.Google is promising its typical Workspace privacy guarantees with Personal Intelligence, saying \"because this data already lives at Google securely, you don't have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience.\" In other words, it's not going to move the needle on how much data about you Google can access, but at least it'll prevent you from having to connect your Workspace to third parties. The company also promises that data Personal Intelligence pulls from sources like Gmail won't be used to train Gemini, but that \"specific prompts and responses\" might be, at least after personal data has been filtered out.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle also says, \"Gemini will try to reference or explain the information it used from your connected sources so you can verify it,\" although we don't have any examples of that in action yet. It's worth keeping an eye out, though, if you're worried about hallucinations. To that end, the company does suggest asking Gemini for more information about what it used to come to its answers if you're unsatisfied, and to correct it \"if a response feels off,\" perhaps by saying something like \"Remember, I prefer window seats.\" Theoretically, Gemini will then remember this for next time, using its existing chat history feature. If you're continually unsatisfied, you can hit the thumbs down button on responses to provide feedback.How to turn on Personal Intelligence in Google GeminiGoogle says that eligible users should see an invitation to try Personal Intelligence on the Gemini home screen as soon as it's rolled out to them, but if you don't, you can turn it on manually by following these steps:Open Gemini and click or tap Settings.Click or Tap Personal Intelligence.Under Connected Apps, select which apps you would like Personal Intelligence to take information from.And that's it! Remember, Personal Intelligence is off by default and is only available for paid subscribers for now, so it may be some time until you can actually use it. Google also stresses the Gemini might not personalize every response, as that will save time on more simple requests. The company also said Personal Intelligence for AI Mode in Google Search is currently planned, but does not have a set release date.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Governments around the world are putting the pressure on tech companies to make sure users are actually the age they should be in order to access their services. Sometimes, that means uploading an ID to prove your age; other times, it involves an AI system guessing how old you are based on your appearance, activity, and behavior.Roblox is the latest platform to roll out new age-verification rules, following intense criticism from parents, researchers, and even attorneys general, who, among other claims, assert that Roblox enables predators to connect with children via the platform. In response, the company announced new age-verification rules last September and November before rolling them out in select countries in December. This week, Roblox put them into effect in the U.S. That all sounds good—the problem is, the system is a bit of a disaster.How Roblox's age verification system should workTo verify your age on Roblox, you first complete a \"Facial Age Estimation,\" which uses your device's camera to scan your face within the Roblox app. All photos and video sent through this verification system are forwarded to Persona, an age-verification service, and are subsequently deleted, according to Roblox. (If you're 13 or older, you can also submit an ID to verify your age instead.)\nIf you verify via ID, the system will know your age based on what's printed on your documents. However, the age-verification service through Persona simply estimates your age from your face scan. Say you're 15—after the face scan, the system might estimate that you're between 13 and 15. Once the system knows (or thinks it knows) how old you are, it will allow you to chat with other Roblox users within your appropriate age group, as well as with groups that are nearby. Age groups are segmented as follows: 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, 21+. (Users under nine cannot access chat features at all.) If you don't want to verify your age, you don't have to. However, you won't have access to any chat functionality.  Users 13 and older can chat with users outside their age range as long as they establish those chats through Roblox's Trusted Connections system. They can either add users via their phone's contacts app, or by scanning a QR code in-person to establish trust. Roblox says that a 12-year-old, for example, can chat with users 15 and younger, since that's the next age group in line, but won't be able to chat with users 16 and older. An 18-year-old, on the other hand, can chat with users 16 and older, but could also chat with younger users if they first add them as Trusted Connections.  I see where Roblox is coming from here, to a degree. It makes sense to keep kids chatting with users their own age, but also allow room for close family members and friends to connect. I'm not crazy about some of these age pairings (is it really appropriate for 15-year-olds to be chatting with 9-year-olds?), but seeing as previous policies allowed anyone to chat with anyone, it's a step in the right direction—or would be, if the system actually worked.How Roblox's age-verification is actually working (or not)As reported by WIRED, Roblox's age-verification system isn't exactly operating as intended. In fact, it's a mess. There are issues across the board, from failures in the age verification system itself, to users finding workarounds to fake their ages.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWIRED found multiple users selling age-verified accounts on eBay to minors as young as nine for just $4. Some parents have also apparently given their kids permission to be verified as 21+, even when those kids are not that old yet. This child has his mother scan her face for him, giving him full access to the adult Roblox chat. If a child's parent won't cooperate, no problem: They can just use an avatar or photo of an adult to trick the system, or even draw a fake beard on themselves to get an 18+ estimation.  Users are unhappy with the system too. This Reddit thread is full of players who are frustrated by the age-verification rules, either because the verification violates their privacy, or because they can't get placed into the right age group—and, thus, are locked out of talking with their friends. What's worse, some are being identified as much younger or much older than they actually are, leading to older teens being placed in chats with young kids, or vice versa—the exact situation Roblox claims it is trying to avoid. This user claims their 10-year-old sister was estimated to be between 18 and 20, while another says they were placed in the 13- to 16-year-old age group despite their \"full-ass beard.\" One user even claims they were banned for telling a child to stay out of the 18+ chat.  Roblox is aware of these and many other issues, and on it's developer forum the company announced a series of updates to address them. They include a new ability for parents to correct their kids' age if they were identified incorrectly, as well as an upcoming update to prevent parents from falsifying their kids' ages. But it's yet more evidence that AI age verification systems are not the perfect solution so many companies are touting them as. No one wants to put kids in harm's way, but there has to be a better system in place than these, which jeopardize user privacy, break core experiences, and can even  inadvertently put kids in chats with users they shouldn't be talking to.    \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make. Despite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.  Parents can still supervise their 13 year olds' Google Accounts Luckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\") \nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out. Speaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does this mean for my child's Google Account?As I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.But now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end. It's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You do lose out on the built-in speakers, but it's a worthy sacrifice.The monitor features an RGB ring at the back, with its CoreSync feature creating an ambient lighting effect by projecting the on-screen colors onto the wall behind the monitor. There's also fan-less cooling via a pulsating heat pump, which allows it to run completely silently and without a fan, while reducing burn-in risk. These are critical features in high-end QD-OLED displays. (You also get a large array of ports. Two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, USB-A hub, and a headphone jack.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn its review of the earlier model with the Tizen OS, PCMag gave it a 4-star \"Excellent\" rating, and the display panel and specs remain the same in the model currently on sale. According to PCMag's expert review, \"Rocking a full 4K resolution (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) at a maximum 240Hz refresh rate, the monitor looks fantastic and plays even better... [It] excels for gaming and does everything else to a very high standard too.\" It's a good buy, especially at this price.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Do you wish you could take care of all those updates at once? Updatest is an application made for exactly this.I've talked about Homebrew for Mac, which is a command line tool for installing and updating Mac software. Updatest scans all the software on your computer and updates it using Homebrew, even if you didn't initially install it that way. But there's more. Many applications use an open source tool called Sparkle to offer updates, and Updatest can find and update all of them. The application can also identify applications downloaded from GitHub that have newer releases, along with any application you downloaded from the Mac App Store.Basically, if an application has updates, Updatest can find them and install them for you. To get started, click the download button on the app's website (you can also install using Homebrew, if you've already set that up). The application will tell you a bit about how it works, ask you which categories of applications you want to update using the tool, and offer to install Homebrew if you haven't done that already.\nOnce you're done with all of that, you will see a list of all the applications on your system. You can filter to see only the apps that need updates, if you want.Click any application to learn more about the update. From here you can install the update. Alternatively, you can click the Bulk Update button below the search bar to update all of your outdated applications at once. You can watch the updates happen by clicking the Terminal button in the top-right corner, or you can let the application do its thing while you work on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome updates require passwords, in which case you'll be asked to run the update command in the Terminal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd in some cases, applications from the Mac App Store won't update—in my tests, this was mostly iPad apps I've installed. The application will instead give you a link to open the App Store and install the update.These minor annoyances are inevitable, and not too burdensome. And it's nice to be able to check all of my applications for updates in once place. If you're interested, there's a 15-day free trial, allowing you to get a feel for how the application works. After that you can buy a personal license, which works on up to three Macs, for $9.99; a household license, which works on up to 10 Macs, costs $19.99.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Unfortunately, after testing following the announcement, some are still holding their breath.When did the X deepfake porn controversy begin?The controversy started earlier this January, after the social media site added a feature allowing X users to tag Grok in their posts and prompt the AI to instantly edit any image or video posted to the site, all without the original poster's permission. The feature seemingly came with few guardrails, and according to reporting done by AI authentication company Copyleaks, as well as statements victims have given to sites like Metro, posters on X quickly started using it to generate explicit or intimate images of real people, particularly women. In some cases, child sexual abuse material was also reportedly generated.It's pretty upsetting stuff, and I wouldn't advise you to go looking for it. While the initial trend seemed to focus on AI photos of celebrities in bikinis, posters quickly moved on to manipulated images of regular people where they appeared to be pregnant, skirtless, or in some other kind of sexualized situation. While Grok was technically able to generate such imagery from uploaded photos before, the ease of access to it appeared to open the floodgates. In response to the brewing controversy, Musk had Grok generate a photo of himself in a bikini. However, the jokes ceased after regulators got involved.\nGovernments are starting to investigateEarlier this week, the UK launched investigations into Grok's alleged deepfake porn, to determine whether it violated laws against nonconsensual intimate images as well as child sexual abuse material. Malaysia and Indonesia went a step further, actually blocking Grok access in the country. Yesterday, California began its own investigations, with Attorney General Rob Banta saying \"I urge XAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"X is implementing blocksIn response to the pressure, X cut off the ability to tag Grok for edits on its social media site for everyone except subscribers. However, the Grok app, website, and in-X chatbot (accessible via the sidebar on the desktop version of the site) still remained open to everyone, allowing the flood of deepfaked AI photos to continue (said photos would also still pose the same problems even if generated solely by subscribers, although X later said the goal was to stem the tide and make it easier to hold users generating illegal imagery accountable). The Telegraph reported on Tuesday that X also started blocking tagged Grok requests to generate images of women in sexualized scenarios, but that such images of men were still allowed. Additionally, testing by both U.S. and U.K. writers from The Verge showed that the banned requests could still be made to Grok's website or app directly.Musk has taken a more serious tone in more recent comments on the issue, denying the presence of child sexual abuse material on the site, although various replies to his posts expressed disbelief and claimed to show proof to the contrary. Scroll at your own discretion.To finally put the controversy to bed, X said on Wednesday that it would now be blocking all requests to the Grok account for images of any real people in revealing clothing, regardless of gender and whether coming from paid subscribers or not. But for anyone hoping that would mark the end of this, there appears to be some fine print.Specifically, while the statement said that it would be adding these guardrails to all users tagging the Grok account on X, the standalone Grok website and app are not mentioned. The statement does say it will also block creation of such images on \"Grok in X,\" referring to the in-X version of the chatbot, but even then, it's not a total block. Instead, the imagery will be \"geoblocked,\" meaning it will only be applied \"in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\" X's post also says that similar requests made by tagging the Grok account will also be geoblocked, although because the section before this says that the Grok account won't accept such requests from any user, that appears to be a moot point.It's important to note that, while the majority of the criticism lobbed at X during this debacle does not accuse the site of generating fully nude imagery, locations like the UK ban nonconsenual explicit imagery regardless of whether it is fully nude or not.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome users can still generate sexualized deepfakesIt's the biggest crackdown X has made on these images yet, but for now, it still appears to have holes. According to further testing by The Verge, the site's reporters were still able to generate revealing deepfakes even after Wednesday's announcement, by using the Grok app not mentioned in the update. When I attempted this using a photo of myself, both the Grok app and standalone Grok website gave me full-body deepfaked images of myself in revealing clothing not present in the original shot. I was also able to generate these images using the in-X Grok chatbot, and some images changed my posing to be more provocative (which I did not prompt), too.As such, the battle is likely to continue. It's unclear whether ignoring the Grok app or website is an oversight, or if X is only seeking to block its most visible holes. One would hope the former, given that X said that it has \"zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\"It is worth noting that I am located in New York State, which might not be part of the geoblock, although we do have a law against explicit nonconsensual deepfakes.I've reached out to X for clarification on the issue and will update this post when I hear back. However, when NBC News reached out with similar questions, the outlet was only told \"Legacy Media Lies.\" I can't make any promises as to how the site will reply to my own requests.In the meantime, while governments continue their investigations, others are calling for more immediate action from app stores. A letter sent from U.S. Senators Ron Wyden, Ben Ray Lujan, and Ed Markey to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai argues that Musk's app now clearly violates both App Store and Google Play policies, and calls on the tech leaders to \"remove these apps from the [Apple and Google] app stores until X's policy violations are addressed.\"\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends. You can follow Justin on Mastodon and Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter, Connectivity.\n        \n        \n            Areas of Expertise\n        \n        Read Full Bio\n    \n\n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        January 15, 2026\n                \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n    \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Justin Pot\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Say what you will about AI (and I've said plenty) but the progress in transcription and speech-to-text software is genuinely impressive. Whereas before such software was either clumsy or expensive, there are now all kinds of great open source tools that work well.Which brings me to Pipit, a free Mac dictation app that works offline, meaning it's totally private. Even more interesting, it can be used to do more than just transcribe speech—it can launch apps, toggle settings, and even launch a web search or query an AI service.The first time you open the application, it will ask for permission to use your microphone before downloading the Parakeet model for offline transcription. Once everything is set up you can use the application by pressing and holding the Option key, then talking—the application will record what you say, turn that into text, and paste the text into the currently active text field.\nI've been trying this for a couple of days and find that the transcriptions are generally pretty accurate, complete with punctuation. There is optional post-processing, which can turn unstructured speech into a properly formatted document, but using that requires an OpenRouter API key.The settings window lets you change the trigger key, choose an input device, and toggle the menu bar icon. There's also a tool for transcribing audio files, complete with speaker identification. Just drag over a file and you get a transcription.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            The uploads screen for Pipit, allowing you to transcribe audio files.\n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nFinally, on the Enhance tab, you can enable the Quick Actions feature. This allows you to verbally tell your computer what to do and see it happen. To use this, start transcription as normal, but say something like \"open Safari\" to open an app or \"ask Claude\" followed by a question to launch a conversation with that AI assistant in your browser. It's a little gimmicky, granted, but I enjoyed using it.\n    \n            \n            The voice commands you can use with Pipit, as seen in the settings.\n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's excellent that tools like this are broadly free now, and Pipit has an interesting collection of features. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

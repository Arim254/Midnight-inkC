Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There's a good reason for this: Most Americans use government services at some point, and many may be apt to trust, or at least engage with, someone claiming to be from a well-known agency. Plus, the threat of losing benefits or being targeted by legal action is especially compelling when it comes from a government representative, and victims may be more likely to comply with scammers' demands. It's no surprise, then, that schemes currently making the rounds involve Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits, according to warnings from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Social Security numbers are often part of identity theft, so it would be alarming to receive a notice that yours has been involved in criminal activity. Scammers are counting on this when impersonating the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and trying to trick you into actually giving up your SSN and other sensitive information.  \nHere's how the scheme works: Fraudsters are sending emails with the subject line \"Alert: Social Security Account Issues Detected\" and including attachments on letterhead that looks like it comes from the OIG. The notice contains official-seeming information, such as a reference number and case ID, and states that your SSN will be suspended within 24 hours due to fraudulent activity on your account. The letter also says that criminal charges have been filed and even includes the statutes that have supposedly been violated. Recipients are instructed to call the number listed to \"respond to these allegations,\" but the person on the other end is a scammer impersonating an SSA employee. They will try to exploit your fear and confusion to collect personal and financial information from you. VA benefits overpayment scamScammers are also contacting veterans and military family members who receive VA benefits, claiming that said benefits have been overpaid and pressuring targets to pay back the money owed. According to the VA's advisory, fraudsters are using fake VA letterhead and logos on notices sent by mail and email as well as spoofing real VA phone numbers. They are trying to convince beneficiaries to make payments immediately using methods like wire transfers, cryptocurrency, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards, and they may also request sensitive information your VA login or bank account credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile VA benefits could legitimately be overpaid, the VA won't contact you and demand money—especially via bitcoin and other unrecoverable methods. Nor should you ever have to pay an upfront fee for assistance with managing VA debts and claims (the VA does this for free). If you do actually owe money, you will be able to find more information on repayment through your official VA.gov account. Always verify through official VA channels, such as VA.gov and the VA’s Debt Management Center (800-827-0648). Never rely solely on unsolicited communication, and never give out your password, SSN, or financial information. Government agencies don't send threatening notices via email (or by any other means), so if you receive a scary letter out of the blue, don't act without investigating. Always contact the agency via the information found on its website—don't call or text any number provided in these notices.   \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It's always at hand, can capture photos, videos, and voice notes as well as text, and is able to log locations, trips and more. Its new AI tools can even draft a few entries automatically for you.What's more, your phone probably now comes with a journal app preinstalled: Apple's Journal app launched in 2023, and a brand new Journal app from Google, initially exclusive to the Pixel 10, is now available on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 too (apparently because these phones also have Gemini Nano on board). Plus, a wide selection of third-party options is available on the Android and iOS app stores.In recent days, in an attempt to determine whether or not journaling on my phone might be for me, I've tested out both the Apple and Google offerings, as well as some of the best third-party alternatives. Here's what I found, and which apps I'd recommend if you want to log your thoughts and feelings on your phone.\nThe built-in optionsJournal by AppleLet's start with Journal by Apple, launched in December 2023. It's fair to say there haven't been a ton of updates released for the app since then, but all of the essentials are covered: Your journal entries can combine text, photos, videos, audio, locations, and sketches, and you can even set up multiple journals for different purposes.I do like the way this app makes suggestions for journaling, particularly in terms of recent locations and photos—it means it's easier to get started or to jump back in after a while. There are also a good number of options for what you can attach to your journal entries, and I can see myself using the mood slider a lot.\n    \n            \n            Journaling with Apple.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJournal by GoogleAs for the Journal app that Google recently launched for Android, it is limited to those with a phone from the Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 series. It's also pretty bare bones: I was able to log text, photos, videos, and places, as well as fitness data collected through Health Connect, but there's nothing here for audio or moods.In addition, the interface is rather plain—much more spartan than the Apple equivalent. You do get a neat overview of all your posts, but it's not particularly inspiring, and you can't configure multiple journals. In addition, the AI-powered prompts for what to write about remain exclusive to Pixel 10 handsets, so you have to do without these on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9.\n    \n            \n            Google's Journal app sticks to the basics.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNeither of these are bad apps; each will do the job of getting down your thoughts in a digital format, with some useful extras attached. The biggest benefits are they're both well integrated into their respective operating systems, and you don't need new accounts to use them. Apple's journal app is certainly better than Google's at the moment, though it's had a two-year head start.If you just want something quick and simple that's made by the company that made your phone (and that may well come preinstalled on your phone), then they're fine. However, these two journal apps remain rather bare bones compared to the other options, as well as keeping you locked in on either Android or iOS. That's why, if you're serious about your journaling, I think it's worth exploring a third-party app installed.The best third-party journal appsDay One\n    \n            \n            Day One was one of the first mobile journals to appear.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOutside of Google and Apple, Day One (Android and iOS) has long been one of the best journaling apps around—and you can take it with you if you ever jump between the Apple and Google platforms. It's been around since 2011 and is stacked with features, including multiple view types, prompts, tags, summaries, recaps, and a gorgeous design that looks great on every device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYour entries can include all the usual features, plus weather details, playlists, health data, social media posts, and more. You get a lot for free, but there is also a premium plan available for $50 a year. It gives you support for unlimited images, videos, and audio, plus extras like the ability to create journal entries over email.5 Minute Journal\n    \n            \n            5 Minute Journal focuses on positivity.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAs someone just dipping a toe into the world of journaling, 5 Minute Journal (Android and iOS) appeals right from the name. The idea is you don't have to spend too long jotting down your thoughts and ideas each day, and the app is geared towards getting you to record the more positive aspects of your life, boosting mindfulness and well-being.I like the writing prompts and journaling reminders this app provides to keep you motivated, as well as the really simple way you can log your mood as you go. It's also a beautifully designed and organized app—a completely different aesthetic experience than a more utilitarian option like Google Journal. However, some features (including unlimited photos and videos) requires a premium subscription, which starts at $5 a month.Rosebud Journal\n    \n            \n            Rosebud comes with a few AI prompt extras.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne more recommendation from my own experience: Rosebud (Android and iOS). It's branded as \"AI-powered\" but thankfully you don't have to worry too much about that, and it does a really nice job of summarizing and tracking your thoughts over time, as well as encouraging you to jot stuff down in the here and now.The app does quite a bit of hand-holding and prompting, but that's perfect if you're just getting started or struggling to journal each day, and you can always just  jot down standard journal entries with text and images if you prefer. As you might have guessed given the other options on my list, there is a pro-level subscription for $13 a month that gives you a lot more insights in terms of past entries, trends, and emotional patterns and triggers, if an AI's summary of your life is interesting to you.The best journal app is the one you useOne of the benefits of there being so many journal apps out there is that there really is something for everyone, so there's no harm in testing out Google and Apple's offerings first—they are, after all, completely free. But for journaling apps that really invest in user design and features, there are much better options out there. Now I just need to pick the one I'm going to stick with, because in the end, the best journal app is the one that you use consistently. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Drywall? Sanding. Every piece of wood you cut and install in a DIY project? Sanding. Want to repair or refinish your floors, or furniture? Yup, probably sanding. And there’s nothing worse than laboring over a large sanding project—you feel it in your arms and back for days, and your hand starts to cramp holding that buzzing hand sander for long periods of time. That is, until I picked up this palm sander from Bosch, which is so comfortably designed, I haven’t hated sanding since—and my Tylenol consumption has plummeted. If you use a hand sander frequently, this will definitely be an upgrade for you.\nThe wood stairs in my old house have a lot of character, which is a polite way of saying they are beat up. I’m not in the market to replace both staircases, though, so I try to keep them in good shape. I recently decided to sand them down and repaint them, and wasn’t looking forward to the process. I needed a new hand sander, so after a bit of research that praised the GSS20-40’s comfort, I picked one up for the job. It was a great experience.The first reason I love this hand sander is that it’s relatively quiet and doesn’t buzz as much as others—there’s a lot less vibration. That vibration can be very fatiguing over long periods of use, so cutting it down makes a huge difference both in how comfortable the tool is to use generally and how long you can tolerate it. And the longer you can tolerate using the tool, the more you can accomplish.\nThe GSS20-40 also has a very comfortable two-handed grip. You can use it one-handed, but I always wind up using two hands because I feel more in control of the tool. Normally, this is pretty awkward, because most hand sanders have pommels that are just a bit too small for two-handed operation, but with this model it works well.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe sander is well-designed in general. The speed dial is on the back, and it’s easy to adjust depending on the material and results you’re getting. It’s a sheet sander, with sandpaper clamping into place over the pad. I’ve had trouble with shifting paper in previous sanders, but the Bosch held the sheets in place reliably.This is a corded tool—one of the few corded tools I still use, actually. I hate having to deal with extension cords like it’s 1995, but I think the comfort and performance make it well worth the extra trouble. If you’re going to be doing a lot of sanding at some point, definitely check this one out—your arms and back will thank you.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

Not only can you save yourself from more expensive heating bills with thoughtful weatherproofing, but you can also be more confident in the event of winter storms or simply more comfortable when you choose to stay indoors. Keeping your house warm, cozy, and safe for the winter is made easier by addressing potential problems early through simple checks and chores now. Here are all the home maintenance tasks you should do in November.1) Add vent covers to your vents and crawlspacesWhen the weather gets colder, wild animals seek a good place to shelter for the winter. If you have uncovered vents or crawl spaces, they can prove to be an inviting spot for creatures. To keep them out, see that you have vent covers in place and that crawl spaces or any other exterior nooks and crannies are sealed up or covered with a sturdy metal mesh. If you don't have vent covers installed, consider adding them. This method will help defend against squirrels, raccoons, rats, mice, birds, and bats.2) Change the batteries in your fire and carbon monoxide alarmsIf you have non-wired smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, change the batteries once a year—even before they begin making the annoying low-battery beep, if you're up for it. While you're at it, check your various hazard detection systems to ensure they work properly. Since people spend more time indoors during the colder months, there is an elevated risk of fire from the use of heaters, candles, and cooking. Additionally, keeping windows closed and sealed can increase the risk of carbon monoxide accumulation inside. Giving your detectors a once-over can help reduce your risk.\n3) Install weatherproofing to doors and windowsIf you live in an older home or have windows or doors that aren’t well-insulated, November is a good time to weatherproof problem areas. Begin by inspecting the weatherstripping around doors and windows, checking for leaks, broken, or worn stripping. If you find any gaps, use replacement weather stripping to seal them. If you have bigger leaks around windows or doors, or older windows that let in too much air, you can also use a weatherization kit to temporarily seal off leaky openings with heat-shrinking plastic wrap. This basic weatherproofing will keep you warmer and help save money on utility bills.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n4) Organize your winter weather suppliesIf you live in an area that can get a lot of snow and ice in the winter, stock up on ice melt, shovels, and roof rakes. Take a look at your snow removal tools and make sure they’re in good shape before it’s time to use them, as replacing equipment before a storm can save you a lot of headache later. It's also a good time to stash your ice scraper, snow brush, and snow chains in your car's trunk. If you live in an area with heavy snowfall and ice, consider keeping a scraper and de-icer in your garage or utility room, so you can access them if your vehicle becomes frozen over.5) Clean ovens, toasters, and other crumb-catching appliancesKitchen fires can be caused by ovens, toasters, and other cooking appliances that have crumbs and other burnt food deposits. Since people tend to stay home and use their ovens more during colder months—not to mention entertain more during the holiday season—ovens and toasters can get a more intense workout this time of year. Checking that your appliances are clean and hazard-free in November can save you from a disaster down the road, not to mention that you'll be happier with cleaner appliances and less work during spring cleaning season.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

In macOS 26 Tahoe, Apple's shipped a bunch of ways to customize the look and feel of your Mac's desktop, app icons, and menu bar, among other things. And there's more to it than just tweaking how Liquid Glass looks. If you're the sort of person who enjoys theming and customization, try these tips.Tweak app icons in the Dock\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYour Mac's Dock probably has a bunch of colorful icons. I've always enjoyed those diverse colors, but others might want something more uniform. If you feel like going with a particular tint, or if you just want your app icons to use dark mode, it's just a quick tweak away. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and go to System Settings > Appearance > Icon & widget style. Here, you can change the app icons to Dark, Clear, or Tinted. The Tinted option lets you select a single tint for all your app icons, so choose the color you like the most.Customize the clock in your Mac's lock screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOnce you upgrade to macOS Tahoe, you'll probably notice the new clock on your lock screen. You can tweak this to your liking, too. Just go to System Settings > Wallpaper > Clock Appearance. You can choose one of six clock styles. Don't forget to adjust the slider below the Weight option, which lets you change the font to make the clock look sleeker or more prominent.\nCustomize the Control Center\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWith iOS 18's release in 2024, Apple started letting you customize your iPhone's Control Center. This year, that feature is finally on Mac, starting with macOS Tahoe. To use it, just click the Control Center button in the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen, and select Edit Controls. There are plenty of controls to choose from, so take your time and add what you need. You can drag-and-drop any of the controls to move them around, or you can click the - (minus) button next to any control to remove it from the Control Center. Alternatively, you can tweak your control center under System Settings > Menu Bar > Menu Bar Controls.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOne of the more controversial changes to macOS Tahoe is the swap to a transparent menu bar. The clear color sometimes makes it harder to read text, but if you don't like that, you can restore a background to your menu bar. This feature is under System Settings > Menu Bar > Show menu bar background.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChange folder icon colors on Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're tired of the default blue color for folder icons, macOS Tahoe lets you tweak this to suit your style. Go to System Settings > Appearance > Folder color and use the drop-down menu to change the color of folder icons. I'd have never thought of myself as a person who uses orange folder icons, but I suppose we all go through a tangerine season at some point in our lives.Switch Mac theme in Settings\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nmacOS Tahoe also gives you limited control over your Mac's theme. If you go to System Settings > Appearance > Theme and pick a color, you'll notice that this color also applies to the cursor in writing apps, and the color of selected items in menus, too. On the same menu page, you can also choose a different color for highlighted text, which is a nice additional level of customization. It ensures that if I pick a particularly bright color for my overall theme, I can still choose a milder color for text selection. That helps me stay focused while I'm working, which is something I value a lot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        At this late stage in the streaming era, we're all overwhelmed by more digital subscriptions than we can keep track of, from fitness apps to cloud storage. Still, it certainly feels as though Netflix is one of the subscriptions that people are least likely to ditch—and that's backed up by the numbers.Perhaps it's because Netflix was the first company to really make streaming work, or perhaps it's the vast catalog of content it's amassed, or perhaps it's just because of Stranger Things and Squid Game. Whatever the reason, Netflix's churn rate is impressively low. Subscribers stick with it.Certainly it's always something I've long considered a mainstay on my streaming device. But recently, in the midst of reevaluating all of my monthly subs, I decided to save myself some money and actually cancel Netflix. It has gone so well, I'd suggest you do the same.\nHere's what I've noticed since my life became Netflix-free—and I have a strong suspicion this might be your experience too. (Full disclosure: I will eventually subscribe again, if only to finish Stranger Things, but there are benefits to quitting, even if only temporarily.)I didn't miss it as much as I thought I would\n    \n            \n            Netflix content: There's a lot of it.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI was quite a heavy Netflix user before I gave it up, and would often cycle through the recommended list of shows and movies in the evening and especially on weekends. I've recently binged my way through shows like The Diplomat, Dept Q., Departure, and The Glass Dome. I could always find something to watch on Netflix.But when I stopped being able to access Netflix, I realized didn't really miss it all that much. My viewing switched to other streaming services, and free, ad-supported channels in particular. There's actually more free content out there than you might have realized. I even did some fun rewatches of movies and shows I'd previously purchased on various platforms (because I don't always want to rent something for the evening).I've also been spending less time streaming video in general—more of my time has been put towards gaming and reading since I ditched my Netflix subscription. I've even been to an actual movie theater once or twice (not that you can see anything developed by Netflix on the big screen for the most part). The prices keep going up\n    \n            \n            Need an extra member? That's an extra cost.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nBefore I quit Netflix, I was on the most expensive plan: It's £18.99 a month here in the U.K., and $24.99 a month in the U.S. This gets you the best audio and 4K HDR video quality, spatial audio, four simultaneous streams, and six devices for downloading content. It's actually one of the most expensive streaming packages there is, and prices keep going up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAfter the great password crackdown of 2023, you can't even share the account with anyone who doesn't live with you either—at least not unless you pay an extra fee (£4.99 here in the UK, $8.99 in the US). By any measure, that's a significant chunk of money. If you're paying for the best plan plus an extra member and decide to take six months off Netflix, you'll saving yourself more than $200.There are cheaper plans available of course, if you want to sit through ads and put up with lower-resolution video—but I thought the whole point of paying for streaming was to avoid ads? It's hard to imagine Netflix ever dropping its prices, so this is a problem that's likely to get worse over time.Your account will be preserved for two years\n    \n            \n            Netflix will hang on to all your viewing history for a while.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne of the reasons you might be reluctant to cancel Netflix is because you think you'll lose years' worth of your viewing history and your personalized recommendations, and have to start again with a blank slate if you decide to sign back up. But in fact, Netflix stores your account information for 24 months—including ratings, game saves, and other account details.As long as you resubscribe again within a couple of years, you'll find everything as you left it (though you may need to scan some plot recaps for shows you were halfway through binge watching). This suggests Netflix is keen to leave the option to resubscribe open as long as possible. In my experience, it'll definitely send you lots of emails about rejoining in the meantime.I'm going to go back to Netflix someday—there's just too much stuff on there that I want to watch—but after years and years as a customer, it's been an interesting experiment to see what life is like without it. Certainly after this, I wouldn't be worried about taking another Netflix break in the future. When I decide I want to resubscribe, it'll only take a couple of clicks or taps.\n            ",

    "body": "Credit: René Ramos/Lifehacker/MR.Cole_Photographer/Moment/TrongNguyen/iStock/cyano66/Getty Images\n                            \n        \n        Generative AI is changing the way we live and work in a multitude of ways, and that includes coding. The best AI bots of today can debug, refine, and create code, from a simple text prompt. You can put together a small app or website in the same way you can generate an image or write an essay with these tools.Many professional programmers are now leaning heavily on AI to help get their work done, but the door has also been opened for those without any coding experience to get involved. This is something that's been termed \"vibe coding\"—where you're coding on vibes, basically—and all you need to get started is an idea.But is it really as simple as simply typing out what you want and letting an AI bot do the coding on your behalf? According to a lot of AI enthusiasts I see on X, vibe coding means \"it's over\" (whatever \"it\" is), and people are \"one-shotting\" all kinds of projects (as in, using a single prompt to create something).\nTo investigate further, I tried to create a little project of my own using ChatGPT and Gemini. Here's how it went. There's no official, fixed definition of vibe coding, but in general it refers to using natural language prompts to get an AI to code apps and websites. In the same way as you might ask ChatGPT for an image of a cabin in a wood, you can also ask it for a landing page for your company, or a tool to log and analyze income and expenditure.Usually, despite all the talk of one-shotting, the idea is not to try and get everything included in your very first prompt, but to start small and then use follow-up prompts to refine. There are several variables involved when it comes to building websites and apps, and so you're going to have to specify layouts, images, interactions, colors, fonts, and plenty more.You can always get the AI to make some of these decisions for you, but to really get something close to what you originally imagined you're going to want to be specific. AI bots are also able to debug code and fix problems for you—again, you just describe what's not working. It's a bit like having a conversation with an actual programmer.\n    \n            \n            ChatGPT can produce masses of code from a single prompt.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nA common way that people get started with vibe coding is to build simple games, and you'll find plenty of examples of this on the web. You describe what you want to happen, and the AI writes something to match—then you chat through how you'd like the gameplay to flow, and how the visuals should appear on screen.All of the major AI chatbot tools now have coding components included in them, and will present you with both the raw code (which you can edit manually, if you want), and a preview of how the executed code works—your app will run or your website will be displayed right inside the chatbot interface. The AI can even select a coding language for you, if needed.Vibe coding has its limitations, not least because of the unpredictability of AI, and for larger, professional software programs and games these AI bots will just be one tool among many that coders use—there is the potential for disaster if AI is not used carefully. However, for fun, small projects, this is something now available to anyone with access to an AI with coding capabilities.Trying out vibe codingI decided to build a simple HTML-based elevator sim I could run in my browser—I've always been slightly confused about how elevators work, and it seemed like a suitable project for testing vibe coding.ChatGPT was the first AI bot I tried to get to help me, and I quickly realized that quite a lot of prompting is needed—more than you might think at first. I couldn't just say \"build me an elevator sim\": I had to specify the screen layout, the number of floors, the speed of the elevator, how the passengers should be displayed, and how to determine the floors they're heading to, just for starters.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAfter a few minutes of the AI thinking, I had my sim.  And it worked, up to a point. However, it didn't all work, all at the same time. Some of the issues the app had were freezing at certain floors, not picking people up in the right order, forgetting how many passengers were actually in the elevator, and generally not following elevator logic—each time I would point out the mistake, ChatGPT would apologize and try again.\n    \n            \n            ChatGPT's elevator sim—which never properly worked.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nMost bugs could be fixed within a prompt or two, but then new issues would appear. One problem that was particularly difficult to solve was getting the elevator code to go back and pick people up when the cab was full the first time. Because I didn't understand the code, I couldn't really see where the problem was. With each revision the AI was apologetic, but didn't seem to grasp what was going on.At one point the elevator would zoom around the floors picking everyone up who called for a ride, without dropping off the existing passengers first. Then a weird graphical glitch developed on the passenger sprites. By this stage, even vibe coding was starting to feel like hard work: After about 45 minutes, and still without a fully working elevator sim, I decided my time and effort would be better spent elsewhere.I gave Gemini a go with this task too, and to Google's credit, it did do better. There were fewer issues, but there were still issues: Passengers still got picked up in the wrong order, and it didn't follow my instructions entirely. I spent less time on this with Gemini, but it got closer to what I wanted, even if it still had glitches I wasn't happy with.\n    \n            \n            Gemini was better at the task, but it still wasn't perfect.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOverall, vibe coding was a frustrating experience. Perhaps the issue is with AI understanding how an elevator works, rather than with its actual coding capabilities, but I was disappointed not to be able to get something that worked properly. Maybe when I'm over the annoyances that I had this time around I'll go back and try something different—without the logical complexities of an elevator system.My experience did highlight some of the limitations of vibe coding: You're often going to need a lot of prompting to get the AI to understand what you want, and there will be bugs to fix along the way, even if the chatbots are very accommodating and polite when it comes to fixing those bugs.There are also two recognizable hallmarks of generative AI here, too: An air of confidence and authority in responses, even when those responses are wrong, and unpredictability in the results. These AI models are designed to give varied answers to the same prompts, which is fine when you're churning out 10 AI pictures of a waterfall but not so helpful when you're trying to wrangle some code into shape.\n            ",

After graduating from college in 2019, I had an amazing job offer fall through because of the lockdown. I felt completely rudderless at a time when I thought I had it all figured out. Since we were all stuck inside together for months, there was no hiding my internal distress from my family.\nFortunately, my parents recognized this even more than I did. That year, they gave me a gift that pulled me out of that pit, reignited my passion for creating, and set the journey in motion that led me to my career today as a professional creator and video producer. That gift was the Cricut Explore, and this device literally changed my life.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nWhat is the Cricut Explore?For those of you who don’t know, Cricut Explore machines let you design and cut tons of materials like vinyl, cardstock, iron-on, and even leather into custom patterns that you can use for shirts, hats, or any other DIY projects that you might have in mind. Able to work with over 100 materials, the Cricut Explore line allows you to create almost anything you want on demand in a user-friendly, inexpensive way. The cost-effective aspect was huge for me, as I had almost zero money to my name and all the time in the world to learn. Since the Cricut Explore works via Bluetooth or USB, I was able to create custom items on request for people, featuring specialized materials and designs that would normally take weeks or months to complete. The Cricut took on a pivotal role in my creative process. It led to the creation of XtarBoy Apparel, my custom apparel company, which would eventually support me throughout the entire pandemic. I made custom shirts for yoga studios, limited-run apparel and merch for micro-influencers, and even inked my first sponsorship deal for a motorsport racing team in San Diego.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Cricut also introduced me to an important business mentor in my life. As I was trying to get XtarBoy off the ground, I had quietly taken on a job at a local auto-tinting place in San Diego, and the owner took a liking to what I was working on. He would request custom shop merch and team gear, and was one of the biggest supporters of my side project when I had almost zero faith in myself. He even set aside a corner of the shop for the Cricut, so I could print things for customers whenever I had one, and let me use the shop as a storefront for all my designs. Later, the gifting came full circle when my mom released her first book series, as I was able to help her with promotion and marketing by making custom merch to pair with the book.Gifts can have lasting valueSometimes we take the gifts we receive for granted. There can be an expectation that they should be the newest device, the latest collab, or the most expensive item in order to be considered a “good gift.” But for me, the greatest gift I got wasn’t just the Cricut itself, but the opportunities and experiences it opened up for me to create, take risks, and challenge myself in a new and exciting way.

Now, the shoe that lasted so long for me—the Nike Downshifter—is on sale for $50 or less, depending on the color.\nWhy I love these shoesYou can read the full saga of my 1,000 mile shoes here. Briefly, I wore a pair of Nike Downshifter 12s for nearly every road run I did for about a year, putting 1,024 miles on the shoes by the time I wrote about them. (I've worn them a few times since then, as well.) Since these are a budget shoe to begin with, the value was incredible—6.5 cents per mile, according to my calculations. The current model is the Downshifter 13, which I also own, although I've only put a few dozen miles on mine so far. But they seem to be a very similar type of shoe, and I won't be surprised if they make it into the quadruple digits as well. The Downshifter 13 is the one that's on sale right now.How to get the best price on Nike DownshiftersBoth the men's and women's version of the Downshifter 13 are on sale at Nike's website. (While you can find them at other retailers as well, I like to buy direct from Nike if I can find a good price, because of their excellent return policy.)The regular price is $80 for each version, and the sale price varies by color. I'm seeing prices from $48.97 to $68.97. But there's an additional discount—Nike is also offering a code, BFRIDAY, that gives you 25% off. I threw one of those cheaper pairs into my cart, applied the code, and the price dropped to $36.73. There's an $8 shipping charge, but that means the total is just $44.73. That's less than 45 bucks, shipped, for a pair of shoes that with luck might last a thousand miles. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Instead, they're participating in coordinated boycotts that aim to turn one of the biggest shopping events of the year into a statement about economic power, inequality, and corporate influence in American life.What are the Black Friday boycotts?Two major boycott campaigns are underway during the 2025 holiday shopping season. The first, called \"Mass Blackout,\" is a coalition effort involving grassroots groups including Blackout the System, The People's Sick Day, American Opposition, the Money Out of Politics Movement, and The Progressive Network. Running from Nov.25 through Dec. 2, this weeklong economic protest asks Americans to stop shopping at major retailers, halt their streaming service subscriptions, avoid nonessential travel, and even refrain from working if possible.“No spending. No work. No surrender. The system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as designed—for the wealthy,” says the homepage of the Mass Blackout website. This isn't about hurting small business or communities, but targeting major corporations that \"that profit from injustice, fuel authoritarianism, and crush worker power.”\nThe second campaign, \"We Ain't Buying It,\" is spearheaded by organizations like Black Voters Matter, Indivisible, and Until Freedom. This effort specifically targets major retailers, including Amazon, Target, and Home Depot, during the crucial Black Friday through Cyber Monday period.Both campaigns share similar goals: to demonstrate that everyday consumers and workers hold real economic power, and to protest what organizers see as a political and economic system that serves billionaires and corporations rather than ordinary Americans.Why the Black Friday boycotts are happeningThe timing of these campaigns is no accident. The five-day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday (also known as the \"Cyber Five\"), accounts for approximately 17% of all holiday season sales. It's when retailers are most vulnerable to consumer action—and when consumers have the potential to make the biggest impact.The movements are responding to what they see as an increasingly divided economy, one in which the gap between the richest and poorest Americans continues to widen. \"This isn't about left versus right,\" reads the Mass Blackout website, \"this is about people versus power.\" The goal is a collective refusal to participate in a system where special interests and billionaires shape policy, while working people are exploited and democratic norms are eroded. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, said on CNN that the effort isn't a mere boycott, but a consumer action: \"We're sending a message to companies that when they align with policies that harm us, we will not support them,\" she said. In other words, don't let the word \"boycott\" make you think this is solely an economic movement. It's a political and personal one, too. These aren't isolated protests either—nor are they as fruitless as they may seem to cynics. Throughout 2025, boycotts have proven effective in shifting corporate behavior. Target recently reported declining sales partially attributed to customer backlash over its rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This points to the fact that consumer action really can impact even retail giants.How to meaningfully participate in a Black Friday boycottParticipating in these boycotts (or consumer actions) doesn't require taking dramatic action. The core principle is simple: pause unnecessary consumption during this period, and reconsider your relationship with shopping. It's not just about \"not spending,\" but actually rerouting that time and money back into your own community.If you're interested in participating, here's what organizers suggest you do:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAvoid major corporations. The boycotts specifically target large retailers that dominate the market. If you need to make purchases, support small, local, or independent businesses instead. Small Business Saturday on Nov. 30 is explicitly excluded from the boycott for this reason.Reduce digital consumption. Log off streaming platforms, cancel or pause subscriptions you're not using, and avoid ad-driven platforms unless you're using them for organizing. This removes your engagement from the attention economy that drives corporate profits.Consider a \"working strike.\" Remember \"quiet quitting?\" For those who can't take time off work, organizers suggest working to rule (doing only what's required), going slow, or simply showing up without extra effort. Stop impulse shopping. Black Friday has become synonymous with deals that create urgency, with \"limited time only\" sales designed to trigger immediate purchases. Before buying anything, ask yourself: Do I actually need this, or am I responding to marketing? Will I still want this item in a week? This pause alone can be powerful, and give you time to reconsider shopping at local businesses instead.If you're unable to join the economic shutdown directly, or if you're looking for a way to support those who are, you can take action by donating to mutual aid here. Apolitical reasons to consider participating in a Black Friday boycottEven if you're not politically motivated to participate in these boycotts, there are compelling personal reasons to step back from Black Friday shopping this year.First, most Black Friday \"deals\" aren't as good as they appear. Retailers often inflate original prices to make discounts look more impressive, or offer deals on older models and inferior products. Whatever sense of urgency you feel when shopping this week, remember it's by design. Even if you aren't compelled by the bigger political movements going on, it's worth taking a step back from Black Friday shopping for your own sanity (and wallet). Perhaps most importantly, participating in a boycott—even partially—is an opportunity to reclaim agency. In a consumer culture that constantly pushes us to buy more, choosing not to participate can be surprisingly liberating. It's a chance to align your spending with your values and to recognize that you have power in the economy.The bottom lineWhether or not these boycotts significantly impact retail sales remains to be seen. Economists note that short-term boycotts often face challenges because consumers simply shift their spending to other times. However, organizers argue that the act of participation itself matters—it demonstrates economic consciousness and solidarity that can build into long-term collective action.What is already clear is that these movements reflect growing frustration with economic inequality and corporate power. They're attempting to transform Black Friday from a celebration of consumerism into a moment of collective reckoning about who holds the power in the American economy.You don't have to join a political movement to benefit from stepping back this Black Friday. Simply pausing, questioning whether you really need to shop, and avoiding impulse purchases you'll regret later is a form of participation. Before you reach for your wallet or click \"add to cart,\" take a moment to consider: What if you just didn't? What if instead of shopping, you spent time with people you care about, engaged with your community, or simply rested? In a culture that equates shopping with happiness and consumption with success, sometimes the most radical thing you can do is nothing at all.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I recently used AI to incorporate her art into physical gifts. If you want to achieve the same quality with a meaningful family photo, here's how you can utilize Adobe's new upscaling features to get the best results.\nFor this process, I used Adobe Firefly and Photoshop. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's generative AI application, and the company released a phone app this summer to help you create on the go. If you're a total newbie to Firefly, you can just ask the app for help along the way. Photoshop, which has long been the gold standard for image editing, recently added an AI upscaling feature that can improve scanned photos or images with the click of a button. Here's how I did it.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nHow I used Adobe AI features to make giftsI started by using Adobe Firefly to visualize my mom’s art on various products, including aprons, scarves, and even dresses. Seeing mockup options helped me decide on an apron as the perfect first piece.Next, I brought an image of an original painting into Photoshop and used the AI upscaling feature. Wearables require a much larger print size, and this step ensures every detail stays crisp and vibrant. I then uploaded the file to Printful, a print-on-demand platform. You can also use Printify or a different print-on-demand provider, as the process is nearly identical.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn just a few clicks, the apron was ready to print and ship directly, and it was such a pleasure to see my mom wear her own artwork. With technology and AI, we’ve been able to take her creations beyond the canvas and share them with people everywhere, making every gift feel personal, meaningful, and timeless. If you want to tinker with AI this holiday season, this is one way to get some practice and make a thoughtful gift for a loved one along the way.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

After all, that's how you'll improve. But you have to remember to recognize wins big and small if you hope to keep yourself motivated. The balance between positive and negative as it relates to productivity is delicate, but you do always need to take breaks, do things you enjoy, and remember that you’re getting things done, even during stressful times. That's why you should try creating a “jar of awesome.\" What is a “jar of awesome?” The “jar of awesome” idea comes from Tim Ferriss’ Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers and it’s been popular for some time. Essentially, Ferriss recommends writing your wins down as they occur and putting the slips of paper into a jar. When you need a motivational boost, you can read through them. Visually, the jar even shows you just how much you have accomplished lately. \nThe idea is to help you focus not just on everything that needs to get done, but on what you’ve already done. It’s similar to keeping an accomplishment journal or updating your resume annually, even when you’re not job-hunting, in that it both motivates you and creates a record of your work. Crucially, it keeps that record in real time. It's much harder to remember everything you've accomplished if you try to do it retrospectively or under duress (as anyone confronted with filling out a year-end performance review knows well). With the jar of awesome, if you’re ever called into a surprise meeting about your work or have a review looming, you already have a list of your accomplishments ready to go. Ways to create your own “jar of awesome” Actually filling a jar with little scraps of paper is a touch twee and may not be that easy to keep up with when our lifestyles are so increasingly digital. There are plenty of ways to create a “jar” of awesome that don’t involve making your desk look like a Pinterest-inspired 2013 wedding. Try leaving a page or two dedicated to tracking wins in the back of your planner or creating a designated note on your phone. Create a single source of truth (SSOT) or a file on your computer or drive, dedicated to compiling your list of wins and supporting documentation. (Personally, I'm a big on using a notes app. My list of wins lives on my phone, where I can update it in a matter of seconds.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever you decide to do it, make sure all of the successes are listed somewhere together so the list grows visually. Just glancing at it can be a motivational push, to say nothing of reading through it all. Finally, don’t second-guess yourself when you want to add something. If you picked up the dry cleaning on a stressful day, got all the kids out of the house on time in the morning, or responded to all your emails by the end of the day and it felt good, throw it in. Just because it might seem small in comparison to a big looming project deadline doesn’t mean it wasn’t a win to get it done, so into the jar it goes. The goal is to keep track of just how much you really do accomplish, so don’t leave anything out.Finally, build your reviews into other elements of your productivity plan. When you're making SMART goals, for instance,—clearly defining what you want to do, why you want to do it, and when you need it done by—it's easy to look to past mistakes to see what you need to correct. At the same time, look back on your jar of awesome to see what's been working for you, so you can incorporate more of those elements into your future planning too.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

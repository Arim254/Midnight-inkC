There's WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Signal, Telegram, and iMessage (if you're on iPhone), and that's just the dedicated chat apps. You might have to keep up with new messages on Instagram, TikTok, Threads, even Spotify. If I install one more app with a messaging feature, I'm going off the grid. As it happens, another non-chat app is joining this list. On Tuesday, Zillow—yes, Zillow—announced its app will also now support messaging. Starting today, you can send people messages in the app you use to look at houses you will most likely never actually buy. We live in interesting times, indeed. Of course, Zillow's goal here isn't to become the next WhatsApp. In fact, you can only choose to chat with one other person on Zillow—at least, that's the case for now. The idea of Zillow messaging is strictly to chat about listings you find through the app, without needing to leave Zillow to do so. The goal for most app developers is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, so there's a cynical case to make here for Zillow trapping its users within the app. If you don't move to another chat app to talk about a listing, you're more likely to interact with additional houses on the app. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut I actually see the logic here: If you're in a housing market with a lot of listings, you're probably firing off a number of them every day to interested parties—namely, whoever you're buying the house with. Keeping those conversations in the same app as those listings could be a smart way to keep track of all those houses, instead of the usual routine of \"wait, which house was that? I can't find the text you sent me.\" And the fact that Zillow is limiting this experience to one chat partner at this time means you're not going to be DMing a number of people about houses in your area. This does seem designed for people who are trying to buy a house together to do so with a bit more convenience.How to try Zillow messagingThis feature is live as of this article. To get started, open Zillow on your smartphone or in your web browser. On the app, tap \"Inbox;\" on the web, click your profile in the top-right, then choose \"Inbox.\"  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to start a chat, you need to invite the other person to join you. To do so, choose \"Invite now,\" which will pull up a pop-up about the feature. This screen explains the invite link is good for 24 hours, and that you can only invite one person for now. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nChoose \"Share invitation,\" and Zillow will let you share it wherever you'd like. You can copy the link, and paste it in another chat app, or choose a destination for Zillow to share the link to directly.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Today, YouTube announced that it's going to allow creators to upload bigger thumbnails, plus make browsing and shopping while watching on a TV a bit more convenient. But there's also a big change coming to content itself, and it's not just limited to TVs. Soon, YouTube is going to start using AI to automatically upscale any videos with resolutions lower than 1080p. While you can technically still upload videos that are 720p nowadays, with smartphone cameras getting better and better, that essentially reads to me as \"old videos.\" It's a bit concerning to me, as someone who's been watching a lot of TV shows from the '90s and early 2000s on YouTube as of late.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: YouTube\n                    \n    \nDone right, AI upscaling is a simple way to de-noise a video, and is more resistant to hallucination than generations made from whole cloth. But it's not without its own hiccups, and some creators have actually accused YouTube of using AI upscaling already, without telling them, and with some undesirable results. The accusations have been limited to YouTube Shorts for now, but notably, even Will Smith seems to have possibly run afoul of the system's hidden AI, as the celebrity was himself accused of generating a crowd with AI in a YouTube Short of a recent concert. However, internet sleuths have determined the footage is likely legit, but was automatically made to look like \"AI slop\" by YouTube. Note, for instance, how different the footage looks on Instagram.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLuckily, YouTube says that this version of AI upscaling will be fully in the hands of creators and users. According to the feature's announcement \"Creators will retain complete control over their library, as both original files and original video resolution will be kept intact, with a clear option to opt-out of these enhancements.\" Viewers, meanwhile, will be able to see when AI upscaling has been used thanks to a \"super resolution\" label in the resolution selection settings, and opt for the original resolution instead.Additionally, YouTube told The Verge that videos that were shot below 1080p, but manually remastered and uploaded in 1080p or above, won't be affected by the upscaling tech. What matters is the resolution the video was uploaded in.All of that's a relief for folks like me, who don't want bizarre seven-fingered extras in our sitcoms, although it's unclear whether this control will also extend to YouTube Shorts, or if YouTube might continue experimenting with mandatory AI upscaling there behind-the-scenes (which, to be fair, has not yet been confirmed).Regardless, it makes sense why YouTube is making this change, as it tries to capture more eyes across more devices. Low resolution videos might look fine on a six-inch smartphone display, but blown up to 50+ inches on a TV, not so much. YouTube hasn't said exactly when the feature will go live, but if you notice what looks like weird AI artifacting the next time you're watching a YouTube video, try checking the resolution settings by mousing over the video and tapping or clicking the cog icon.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you buy a product featured here, we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation.\n    \n        \n        You spent hours carving a perfectly frightful jack-o'-lantern for Halloween. Now you just need to light it up somehow for maximum scare factor. Maybe you plan on using electric candles or tea lights to glow up your scary gourd. If you choose the more traditional route of lighting your pumpkin with a real candle, however, you definitely want to follow some fire-safety protocols.\nCarving your pumpkin is only half the battle, but you should also be careful when lighting the candle inside. This is where a reloadable BIC EZ LOAD Lighter can come in handy. The long, thin wand easily gets into your jack-o'-lantern—and your grill, fireplace, and campfires. Now through Oct. 31, you can even save 25% on two BIC EZ LOAD starter kits with the code SPOOKY25.* \nBe smart about lighting your pumpkin’s candleIf you’re going old-school and using a real candle this year, make sure your pumpkin is sitting on a flat, stable surface so that it won’t tip over. Cut a good-sized hole in the gourd’s lid to let the heat from the candle escape, and put in a squatty votive candle, no tapered types. Use the BIC EZ LOAD Lighter to light the candle from a safe distance, and then place the lid ajar so that smoke can get out. Never leave a burning candle unattended.Extinguish and relight up to 15,000* timesAnother Halloween-night safety trick is to blow out your pumpkin’s candle—and all candles—in between groups of trick-or-treaters. As the first reloadable lighter in the BIC lineup, the BIC EZ LOAD ensures you’re always able to brighten any moment in three easy steps.Whenever the lighter wand is running low on fuel, all you have to do is pop open the bottom cap and replace it with a new BIC Maxi Pocket Lighter. Providing up to 15,000* lights, the BIC EZ LOAD Lighter is conveniently replaceable up to 10 times with a BIC Maxi Pocket Lighter.Safe, reliable lighting for Halloween and beyondThe BIC EZ LOAD Lighter will be lighting the moment for many of your Halloweens, backyard bonfires, and camping trips to come. In addition to being reloadable, each lighter goes through over 50 quality checks and meets BIC's stringent safety standards. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow through Oct. 31, nab two BIC EZ LOAD starter kits, with two BIC Maxi Pocket Lighters included, at 25% off with code SPOOKY25. DISCLAIMERS:*Based on reloading up to 10x with BIC Maxi.*25% off orders $40+ through midnight ET on October 31st, 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        If I ever skip my flu shot, or fail to get one for my kids, it's because I didn't find time to get to the pharmacy during flu shot season. That's why I've been excited for FluMist's home delivery ever since I read about its FDA approval last year. My shots arrived this week (in nasal spray form), and I found the whole experience blessedly painless.The FluMist vaccine is a nasal spray, not an injection. It's available for people aged 2 to 49 (with some exceptions) and I try to get it for my kids when it's available. My youngest hates needles, and I sometimes have to call multiple pharmacies to find one that has it in stock. So when home delivery became available, I placed my order right away. How can you get the at-home flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine, called FluMist, still needs to be prescribed by a medical provider. But since nearly everyone aged 2 through 49 is eligible, FluMist’s maker (AstraZeneca) has a created a telehealth website that bundles the provider's approval with an order to an online pharmacy. The process takes about five minutes on average, the company says, and I found that to be accurate. \nI had already gotten a flu shot, so I ordered just for my kids. The website allowed me to add multiple people to the same order, so I filled out the questionnaire for each child, giving their names, ages, allergies, and so on. The website then reached into some big data cloud out there and told me it already knew their insurance information (existentially frightening, yet convenient!) and presented me with my bill: an $8.99 fee, which included $2.50 for physician evaluation and $6.49 for shipping and processing. Insurance covers the cost of the vaccine itself. Who can use the at-home flu vaccine? The at-home vaccine is the same as regular FluMist, which is approved for ages 2 through 49. That means babies and older adults will still need to visit a provider for the regular, injectable flu vaccine. Children can get flu shots starting at the age of six months.FluMist uses a live, weakened virus. It can't give you the actual flu, but it can cause some respiratory symptoms in people with weakened immune systems. So it's not recommended for people who are pregnant, have certain medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have close contact with an immunocompromised person. If that's you, talk to a provider about your best options. You may be advised to get the regular injectable type, which doesn't include any live virus. What happens when the at-home flu vaccine arrivesWhen I placed the order, I had to choose a delivery date (to be sure I'd be home and ready to receive it). It arrived via FedEx, with multiple texts ahead of time letting me know it was on its way. The vaccine needs to stay at refrigerator temperature, so you don't want it sitting out on your porch all weekend. I thought I would have to refrigerate it immediately—the instructions say as much—but it can actually be unrefrigerated for up to 12 hours before administration. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo the box arrived, insulated and with the vaccine packages surrounded by cold packs. There was a \"TiveTag\" sticker on the interior box, so I followed the instructions to download the TiveTag app from a QR code on the package. It installed quickly, and then I just had to hold the phone up to the RFID sticker on the box. A screen told me that the box had stayed at an appropriate temperature the whole time, so I was good to go. How do you give yourself the at-home flu vaccine? Giving the vaccine is simple. To give you a sense: an at-home COVID test is about ten times more complicated. All you have to do here is take off the rubber cap, squirt the vaccine into one nostril, then take off the little spacer around the plunger and squirt into the second nostril. (The spacer makes sure that you get half the vaccine into each nostril.) If you've gotten a FluMist at a pharmacy, it's the same idea. Adults can administer it to themselves, and children will need an adult to do it for them. Instructions are, of course, provided. After I gave it to my kids, I clicked a link in a text message to \"report vaccination,\" which updates their health records in, again, some big ol' data cloud. (I will also let their doctor know at their next appointment.) After you administer the vaccine, there is a prepaid envelope you can use to return the sprayers for disposal. The paper packages and inserts obviously could be recycled. That left me with the cardboard box, its insulated foam liner, and six liquid cold packs that the FluMist site says are filled with \"non-toxic water\" and can be either poured out and recycled, or reused as ice packs if I'd like. \n            ",

Its initial goal was to guarantee that artificial general intelligence (AGI), a type of AI that is theoretically better at humans at most tasks, would benefit everyone.The company has gone through a number of changes in the years since. It hasn't been a true nonprofit since 2019, when it moved to a \"capped-profit\" structure, which limited profits to 100 times any investment. Musk even sued the company last year, claiming it had ditched its original mission in favor of profits. But now, OpenAI is looking more like a traditional for-profit company than ever. On Thursday, it announced the company will now operate under a new for-profit structure, called OpenAI Group PCB, a public benefit corporation. OpenAI's nonprofit arm, which is now called the OpenAI Foundation, holds a $130 billion stake in OpenAI Group PCB, and controls the for-profit company. OpenAI says it is particularly focused on how this move will affect its goals of achieving AGI, and ensuring that AGI \"benefits all of humanity.\" As OpenAI sees it, the better its for-profit businesses perform, the more funds the OpenAI Foundation will have to continue its philanthropic work.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo that point, OpenAI says the OpenAI Foundation is committing $25 billion to two key objectives. The first is to health and disease, as the OpenAI Foundation will aim to create open-sourced health datasets and offer funding for scientists. The second goal will be to bolster \"AI resilience,\" which OpenAI sees as \"maximizing AI's benefits and minimizing its risks.\"According to OpenAI, the OpenAI Foundation and OpenAI Group both have the same mission, and that the terms of the new structure require the for-profit side to advance that mission. What does this mean for OpenAI?The way OpenAI puts it, this move is the best of both worlds for the company. It asserts that it will continue to operate with the same values and goals as it did prior to this restructuring, while at the same time having more freedom to raise capital to fund those efforts.That second point is certainly true. CEO Sam Altman has been working for nearly two years to restructure the company into something that can more easily compete financially with other for-profit companies in the AI space, like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Other strictly-AI companies, like Anthropic and xAI, also have this type of structure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAlready, the move has solidified funds for OpenAI: The Japanese-baed SoftBank had previously pledged to a $40 billion investment, with $10 billion in April and another $30 billion in December. However, that investment was contingent on the company's restructuring plans. Had OpenAI not restructured, SoftBank would've dropped its investment to $20 billion. By bolstering its for-profit core, OpenAI earned itself that extra $20 billion.OpenAI has also agreed to extend an agreement with Microsoft that allows the latter to use and sell OpenAI products. The original agreement ran through 2030, and allowed OpenAI to cancel the deal if the company achieved AGI. But now, the deal runs through 2032, even if OpenAI achieves AGI, so long as the tech has the \"appropriate safety guardrails.\" An independent expert panel will make the call on whether OpenAI has achieved AGI. Rights to OpenAI's research will still be capped when OpenAI achieves AGI, or by 2030, whichever comes first.It's no secret that AI is big business, so this move could realistically continue OpenAI's many financial successes. It may also heat up the race to achieve AGI, as it now allows Microsoft to pursue that benchmark with OpenAI's technologies as well. But against this news is a lingering, and concerning, question: Are we in an AI bubble? And will that bubble burst? OpenAI currently has $1 trillion in AI deals, though only pulls in $13 billion in actual revenue. Perhaps its restructuring will allow it to develop more lucrative revenue streams, but even still, AI is generating a lot of investment without the tangible returns you'd necessarily expect. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Red light therapy devices are everywhere—from lamps, to full-body mats, to those glowing face masks flooding my social media feed. I usually see red light therapy advertised for \"younger-looking skin,\" but I'm not interested in these devices as a means to slow down aging—I'm interested in them as a recovery-obsessed athlete with very sore muscles.These gadgets promise to boost athletic performance, speed muscle recovery, and reduce inflammation, all by bathing your body in specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light. But do these trendy tools live up to the hype, especially for muscle recovery?What red light therapy advocates claimRed light therapy devices typically emit light in the red (620-670 nanometers) and near-infrared (800-850 nanometers) spectrum. Manufacturers claim these wavelengths penetrate the skin to stimulate cellular activity, specifically targeting the mitochondria (the energy-producing powerhouses inside our cells). The purported benefits include enhanced muscle recovery, reduced inflammation, improved circulation, decreased muscle soreness, and even performance gains.\nIt all sounds scientific enough: the light supposedly helps mitochondria produce more ATP (cellular energy) and triggers the release of beneficial compounds like nitric oxide, which improves blood flow and activates repair processes throughout the body. But let's dig into what these gadgets can actually do.What the science actually saysSurprise, surprise: The science is more nuanced than marketing materials suggest. According to Dr. Wesley Buckle, a licensed naturopathic doctor, \"the data on red light therapy is not definitive. Some studies show that it can help with delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle recovery. However, the evidence is mixed. Most of the studies that have found a positive benefit are small, short-term ones.\"While the research shows potential, there's a significant gap between what manufacturers claim and what the evidence actually supports, Buckle says he's seen \"claims of enhanced performance, improved circulation, and muscle recovery\" that are ultimately overblown. \"The evidence supports mild improvements in muscle fatigue. It doesn't support dramatic claims of large gains and strength or performance boosts.\"This is a crucial distinction. If you're expecting red light therapy to transform your performance or replace proper training, you'll be disappointed. The benefits appear to be modest and supportive rather than revolutionary.Another critical factor is device quality. McCall McPherson, a physician associate and founder at Modern Thyroid Clinic and Modern Weight Loss, says that \"not all devices are created equal. The effectiveness depends heavily on the wavelengths used, power output, and build quality of the device.\" It's important to distinguish between medical-grade panels built with specific, researched wavelengths and all the cheaper consumer devices that may not deliver the necessary light intensity or correct wavelengths to produce biological effects.There's certainly promising research, but this research is based on specific wavelengths (typically 620-670 nm for red light and 800-850 nm for near-infrared) and specific energy doses. Many budget-friendly devices don't meet these parameters, which means they're unlikely to produce the results seen in clinical studies.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShould you consider red light therapy?For the average athlete, red light therapy could be a useful addition to a recovery routine—but with important caveats. Buckle advises prioritizing the fundamentals: \"Sleep, nutrition, and proper training are all extremely important. Without these things, red light therapy won't help. It can't replace these practices...Red light therapy could be a good supportive recovery tool for most people. However, it's best to focus on the basics first, such as proper training.\"McPherson is more enthusiastic, saying, \"I really do think red light therapy can be a great recovery tool for casual athletes when used correctly.\" She notes that for best results, athletes should look for quality medical-grade devices and use them consistently right before or after workouts on the specific muscles trained. \"It's not magic,\" says McPherson, \"but it's one of the most well-researched, noninvasive tools we have for reducing soreness and speeding up recovery between workouts.\"The bottom lineRed light therapy for muscle recovery isn't pure snake oil; there's legitimate science supporting its use as a supportive recovery tool. However, the benefits appear to be modest improvements in muscle soreness and recovery rather than dramatic performance enhancements. The evidence is still evolving, with many studies being small and short-term.If you're considering adding red light therapy to your recovery arsenal, remember these key points: First, nail the basics. No amount of red light will compensate for poor sleep, inadequate nutrition, or improper training. Second, invest in quality. If you decide to try red light therapy, choose a medical-grade device with the correct wavelengths and power output rather than the cheapest option on Amazon. Third, be consistent. The research shows benefits with regular use, not occasional experimentation.Finally, manage your expectations. Think of red light therapy as a potentially helpful tool for reducing soreness and supporting recovery—not a miracle device that will dramatically transform your athletic performance. \n            ",

Some devices are more bloated than others: Google Pixels have a relatively \"clean\" build compared to Samsung phones, for example, and don't typically come with third-party apps and games. But you may still want to eliminate apps and features that clutter your home screen, take up valuable space, and create a drag on performance, especially if you have alternatives you like more. On Android, that likely means uninstalling what you easily can and disabling everything else. What you can (and can't) uninstall on AndroidUnfortunately, many preinstalled first-party apps can't be easily removed. This varies by manufacturer and device—for example, Pixel users can uninstall Google Play Games and Books but are stuck with Chrome, Drive, Maps, and Calculator. As HowToGeek points out, you can delete other pre-selected Google apps added during initial setup, such as the Pixel Watch app and NotebookLM. \nOn Samsung Galaxy phones, again, some preinstalled bloatware is locked in, but ZDNET calls out five native apps that most users should delete right away: Global Goals, Samsung Free, Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Shop, and Samsung Kids. To uninstall an app on your Pixel, go to the Google Play Store and tap the Profile icon. Tap Manage apps & devices > Manage, select the app you want to remove, and tap Uninstall. On Samsung, go to Settings > Apps, tap the app name, and tap Uninstall > OK. You can also touch and hold the app icon on your home screen and tap or drag to uninstall. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're absolutely set on removing preinstalled apps that can't be deleted using the above steps, you can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), but these methods are more advanced. How to disable preinstalled appsBuilt-in apps that aren't in use can be disabled, which hides the icon from your app drawer. They'll still take up space, but at least they'll be out of sight. Most preinstalled apps can be disabled if you don't need them, with the exception of critical system apps. On your Pixel, go to Settings > Apps > See all apps to select individual apps, and tap Disable at the top of the screen. You can hide preinstalled Samsung apps from your home screen settings: tap Hide apps and tap the icon of the apps you want to disable, the press Done. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make. Despite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.  Parents can still supervise their 13 year olds' Google Accounts Luckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\") \nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSpeaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does this mean for my child's Google Account?As I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.But now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end. It's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same. \n            \n    ",

If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies.

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications. Maybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.The application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).The whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.It's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.I don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching. YouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one. If you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search. \nHow to remove YouTube Shorts from searchTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.Other changes to YouTube filtersIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.    Finally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters. \n            \n    ",

Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.What is the RICE method of prioritization?RICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for: Reach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impactImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctlyConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factorsEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources requiredA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started. \nHow and when to use RICEI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nStart by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit. Next, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.\n            \n    ",

Luckily, Marshall is offering these Monitor III ANC earbuds, which offer a cool retro look. And right now, they're available for the lowest price ever, at $279.99 (down from $379.99), beating the heavyweights from Sony and Bose on price.\nThese Monitor III headphones feature the iconic Marshall script logo, a retro brass control knob (instead of touch buttons), and a textured black vinyl finish that mimics Marshall guitar amps. Other than the looks, the most impressive part is the battery life. These will last you for 70 hours of ANC playback (and 100 hours without ANC). That is a staggering number; for comparison, the Sony XM6 gets you 30-40 hours of playback per charge. The headphones are also collapsible, folding into a small ball. They come with a hard-shell travel case and are pretty lightweight, too, at 250 grams. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack here, but the box does include a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for wired listening.They feature the signature Marshall sound, warm and punchy. They are tuned for listening to rock, heavy metal and guitar-heavy music, and offer a more fun sound profile compared to Sony or Bose, which can sound a bit more flat or balanced.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn its review, PCMag gave the Monitor IIIs a 4.0 star rating, noting that they deliver a \"pleasing audio signature, a comfortable fit with intuitive controls, easy portability, and excellent battery life.\" \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.POP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.How to keep your third-party accounts working in GmailIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.Use IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.The IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies. See personalized, AI-powered snapshots Gmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.AI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\" \nGet AI Overviews via Gmail searchGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI will proofread your emailsFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise. Like AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.If you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look. \n\n    \n            \n            There are plenty of categories to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.The home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to sign up for a MediaWiki account if you want to be able to contribute to the site too.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nHover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.Click through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Each movie comes with a cast list.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.Obviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.Free movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.\n            \n    ",

However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons. The new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCurrently, there's a waitlist to sign up for ChatGPT Health, and over time it will roll out to all users. At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

In the warmer months, you can take it to the beach or BBQs, and in the winter, it’s durable enough to handle snowy adventures and warm up with your favorite playlist during a hot shower. The Bose SoundLink Micro 2nd Gen Bluetooth Speaker is a tiny yet powerful option that fits the bill for all of the above, and right now it’s 23% off at its lowest price ever: $99 (originally $129).\nThe second-gen Bose SoundLink Micro has richer audio and clarity, as well as battery life that lasts up to 12 hours (twice as long as the first generation). Its appearance is similar to the first, but it’s slightly heavier and larger, measuring 4.0 by 4.0 by 1.7 inches and weighing 11.6 ounces. It comes with a strap that can attach the speaker to bags, handlebars, and more. The controls are located in a groove on the front, including a Shortcut button that lets you pair multiple speakers or activate Spotify Tap. Beyond its powerful sound, it’s also one of the most durable mini speakers on the market with an IP67 rating that makes it waterproof and dustproof (though not safe to submerge for extended periods). It’s a mono speaker with a single driver that connects via Bluetooth 5.4 and supports the AAC and SBC codecs, as well as Google Fast Pair. PCMag, which gives it an “excellent rating,” notes that while it includes a USB-A-to-USB-C cable, it would’ve been more helpful to include a standard USB-C cable. \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \nDespite its high rating, it also doesn’t have the ability to reproduce low frequencies or support high-resolution audio. And unlike the first generation, this model doesn’t have a speakerphone to use for phone calls. The sound performs well despite its portability, and while the bass response isn’t the deepest, it’s impressive for the updated SoundLink Micro’s size. Compared to speakers with fully adjustable EQ, the Bose app EQ is somewhat no-frills and only has three adjustable bands.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUltimately, if you’re looking for a durable portable speaker with high-quality sound, long battery life, and a versatile strap (but don’t mind that it doesn’t have high-resolution audio or a more advanced equalizer), the Bose Soundlink Micro 2nd Gen Bluetooth Speaker is a solid option worth considering at its current discounted $100 price point. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

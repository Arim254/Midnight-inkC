    "body": "\n        \n        If you're a Windows user, this is your monthly reminder to ensure you install all available security updates. Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday release fixes one zero-day vulnerability that has been actively exploited in the wild, with 63 flaws patched in total. As reported by Bleeping Computer, the November Patch Tuesday update addresses 29 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, 2 security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 16 remote code execution vulnerabilities, 11 information disclosure vulnerabilities, 2 denial of service vulnerabilities, and 3 spoofing vulnerabilities. (Note that these figures do not include patches for Microsoft Edge and Mariner.)In addition to the zero-day, four of the vulnerabilities being addressed—two remote code execution bugs and one each of the elevation of privilege and information disclosure flaws—are labeled \"critical.\" \nPatch fixes one zero-day threatAll security updates are important to install as soon as possible, but especially those that patch zero-days, which are vulnerabilities that are actively exploited or publicly exposed before the developer makes an official fix available. Without this month's patch, Windows users are vulnerable to CVE-2025-62215, an elevation of privilege flaw in the Windows Kernel. The bug allows threat actors to gain system privileges upon winning a \"race condition,\" or improper synchronization in Windows Kernel. The vulnerability was identified by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), though no additional details about exploitation have been made public. Other updates for Windows usersWindows 11 users will also see the rollout of the upgraded Start menu alongside Patch Tuesday updates—the new interface is scrollable with app categories and adapts to the size of your screen. Other changes include an redesigned battery icon and improved features for File Explorer, Voice Access, and Click to Do. As of last month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has ended support for Windows 10, though users who have enrolled in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will continue to get security patches through Oct. 13, 2026. \n            ",

Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

You won't get access to the Phone app's latest AI features, but if all you want is a reliable way to record phone calls, you'll be set. Google announced this new rollout back in September, calling the ability to record calls a \"fundamentally useful feature,\" even without transcription or automatic note taking. That's certainly true: While the idea of recording phone calls might strike some as nefarious, there are many legitimate applications for recording phone calls, from journalists seeking a record of an phone interview, to patients calling their healthcare providers to make sure they keep track of all medical advice and instruction. Call recording on Android—especially on Google's Pixel devices—has had a turbulent past. While there was once a time you could download a third-party call recorder app without issue, Google started slowly taking away key functions from developers, like blocking access to recordings from microphones. In 2022, the company announced that was blocking access to Android's Accessibility API, the main workaround developers used for their apps—effectively killing the third-party call recorder market. If your phone's manufacturer supported call recording in their primary app, that was still OK, but if not, you basically lost this functionality. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, Google offers a feature called Call Notes, which transcribes and summarizes your calls using Gemini. In addition to these AI enhancements, however, you still receive a recording of the phone call, making these two Pixel series the only ones with the capability. That's why this call recording expansion is so necessary.Call recording on Pixel isn't perfectThere are two key caveats to keep in mind with this feature, however. First, don't expect to record a call without the other party's permission. Even if you live in a region with one-party consent—meaning you don't need both parties to agree to the recording—Google's call recorder will announce that it is about to record the call. Unless the other party isn't paying attention, they will know you're recording—and could choose to hang up the line if they feel uncomfortable. Second, this feature won't be available to all Pixel users, even if you have the proper Pixel device. This feature will only work in regions where call recording is legal, and Google says it is rolling out the functionality to all countries that support it throughout the rest of this year. It seems as of this article, the United States and Canada have the feature, but many other countries do not. If you live somewhere where call recording is legal, but don't see this feature yet, sit tight: It's likely rolling out soon. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up call recording on PixelTo start, make sure you're using a Pixel 6 or newer, running at least Android 14, or a non-Pixel device running at least Android 9. Next, update your Phone app to the latest version.Now, open the Phone app's Settings, then head to Call Assist > Call Recording. Here, you can turn on the toggle next to \"Turn on Call Recording.\" You can also toggle on \"Automatically record calls with non-contacts,\" if you want the app to start recording whenever someone outside your contacts list calls, or \"Automatically record calls with these numbers\" to manually select contacts you'd like the Phone app to record conversations for. You can choose to automatically delete these recordings after seven, 14, or 30 days, or let them stay on your phone forever. You can skip those latter two options, however, if you'd rather make recordings a case-by-case basis. If so, whenever you're in a call, you can choose the Call Assist button to select \"Call Recording.\" (If this is your first recording, you'll need to download some audio files before you're able to record calls.) When you do, the Phone app will ask if you'd like to record the call, which you can agree to. There is then a short countdown before the system alerts everyone on the call that it will begin recording. You can stop the recording at any time from the Call Assist menu. You'll find your new recording in the Home tab.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Google wants you to trust AI to click the buy button for you. Rolling out today, Google's new \"agentic checkout\" adds onto the company's existing price-tracking feature, so it's not something you'll see all the time. Instead, when you get a price drop notification on an object you've been tracking, you might now see a new \"buy for me\" button that will send all the necessary information to the store's website and make the final purchase for you.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says the AI will always ask your permission before starting agentic checkout, and will only go through with the purchase after you've confirmed all your shipping and payment details (which it will either pull from your Google Pay details, or directly ask you for). The price you'll see also isn't informed by AI, but rather by Google's Shopping Graph, the same information that powers Google Search's Shopping tab. That means it'll come directly from the store you'll be buying from, although while Google does promise it'll surface the most relevant offers for you, just trusting whatever the notification says will take away your ability to manually comparison shop. Once the AI has made your purchase for you, you should see all the usual confirmation emails hit whatever inbox you told the AI to link with your purchase. It all makes sense in theory—you're essentially being given a link to a product, and then telling the AI to go to that link and fill out the checkout form for you. That should cut down on hallucination concerns, assuming you're happy with the link you're buying from. The catch is that every website's checkout form is a little different, so Google's starting with just a few stores for now, to cut down on the chance for errors. That means you'll only be able to try agentic checkout when buying from Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and \"select Shopify merchants\" for now, but Google says there will be \"many more [stores] coming soon.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhile agentic checkout does take what can be a lengthy process down to a single click for buyers, the real use case here might be for sellers. Ensuring people actually click through to your store from a price drop notification can be a pain, and letting customers buy straight from the notification with a single button could make impulse purchases a bit more likely. If you notice yourself about to buy something just because a shiny new button is there, maybe take a beat before tapping it and consider whether you still want it or if you want to check other options yourself first.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nIf you want to try out agentic checkout for yourself, you'll first need to start tracking a product's price, and ensure it's something Wayfair, Chewy, or another participating retailer would sell. To do this, head to the Google Shopping tab, search for either a specific product or a broader product category, and scroll until you find a product card you want to track. Click through and hit the \"Track price button.\" Here, choose a target price as well as options like size or color, and click \"Update\" in the bottom right corner. You'll now get a notification when a listing matches the parameters you set, and if the link Google found is from a participating store, you'll be able to use the \"Buy for me\" button. Click or tap it to ensure your details are correct, then tap \"Buy for me with GPay\" at the bottom of the screen. You'll get a progress bar showing when your purchase has been submitted and confirmed, and the page will tell you where to expect your confirmation email. You'll also get a Buy for me reference ID you can take to Google support, in case you run into any issues.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nUnfortunately, it seems like there's still a few features Google needs to work on here before the AI can do everything a human can. A Google spokesperson told me that agentic checkout currently can't take factors like loyalty programs into account, so if you want to buy the product from a specific store account to get credit for it, you'll still need to make your purchase manually.If you're buying a lot, it could be a time saver, but as for now, those caveats and the limited selection of stores means you'll probably still have to complete checkout yourself on most purchases right now.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Sure, third-party apps have filled this gap for many years now, but macOS itself didn't allow you to easily view multiple items stored in the clipboard, until now. With macOS 26 Tahoe, your Mac's Spotlight search has added support for clipboard history, which means that you can view pretty much everything you've copied in the past 30 days. Here's how to set up and use clipboard history on your Mac.How to enable clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nClipboard history is disabled by default on macOS Tahoe, so you'll have to activate it first. To do this, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's display and select System Settings. Now, go to Spotlight and scroll to the bottom in the right pane. Enable Results from Clipboard, and then click the drop-down menu below it. This lets you choose how long you want to store your clipboard history for. Apple gives you three choices: 8 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. Once you've made your choice, you'll be ready to use clipboard history on your Mac.If you copy sensitive items to the clipboard very often, you should probably avoid enabling this feature. I know many people who somehow still store passwords, credit card information, and other banking details in WhatsApp chats or plain text files. The moment you copy sensitive data from unsecured locations, it gets added to your clipboard history, which is not ideal. The good news is that if you copy passwords from Apple Passwords or other password management apps, they don't appear in your Mac's clipboard history.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccessing and using clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can access your Mac's clipboard history by using macOS Tahoe's Spotlight Search. First, copy a few items to your clipboard. These can be text, photos, or other files. Use the Command-Space keyboard shortcut (or click the magnifying glass in your Mac's top-right corner) to open Spotlight, and press Command-4. This will open your Mac's clipboard history, where you'll be able to see all the files you've copied recently.To see older items, scroll down. Next to each item, you'll see a small copy button, which you can use to copy that item to your clipboard once again. This is useful if you've copied multiple items in a row, but forgot to paste the first few. You can also select any item in your clipboard history list and press the return key on your keyboard to paste that item in the app that's in the foreground. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you want to quickly clear your clipboard history, fire up Spotlight (Command-Space), followed by the clipboard history page (Command-4), and select the three-dots button on the right. Select Clear History here to erase your entire clipboard. Or you can simply wait—Apple will automatically erase everything in your clipboard after your preset time limit (between 8 hours and 30 days, depending on what you chose in System Settings).Third-party clipboard management apps are better\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm aware that some people don't use Spotlight at all, in favor of better alternatives like Raycast or Alfred. Luckily, those apps come with built-in clipboard managers, too. Spotlight's implementation is good enough for basic use cases, but it needs a quicker way to access and paste from your clipboard history. While clipboard history in Spotlight is a nice upgrade, I still feel that if you're serious about clipboard management, third-party alternatives are the way to go. The best clipboard managers for Mac will allow you to sync your clipboard history across multiple devices, let you exclude certain apps from your clipboard history, filter clipboard items by type (links, text, images, etc.), copy multiple items and paste them sequentially (useful for filling repetitive forms), extract and copy text from images, and so much more. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I've written before about other ways to mold Pomodoro to match what you need, but today's idea, Pomodoro 2.0, is one of the easiest and most effective adaptations. What do I mean by \"Pomodoro 2.0?\"First, a refresher on what the Pomodoro technique even is. When you're using this technique to focus and be productive, you set an alarm for 25 minutes, work for that time, then take a five-minute break. You complete that cycle four times, then give yourself a longer break at the end, up to half an hour, before starting again. That's it. It works because you spend those relatively short bursts concentrating on the task at hand, knowing a reprieve is coming. Since they're not too long, it doesn't feel insurmountable. It also works because those breaks play an important role. Taking periodic breaks can make you more productive, both because they give your brain a rest and because they stop you from toiling to the point that your output gets shoddy.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nI saw the idea of \"Pomodoro 2.0\" mentioned on a forum a while back and started Googling. What I found impressed me—it addresses one of the main critiques I have of the original, which is that 25 minutes isn't always enough time to get into a state of deep work, or work that is uninterrupted, purely focused, and effortless enough that time seems to be flowing by.Over at Beyond Productivity, Dr. Christian Poensgen recommends starting the Pomodoro session with a 30-minute work block, then adding more time to it after the break, tacking on between 15 or 60 minutes. I recommend doing this incrementally, adding 15 every time, so you work for 30, then 45, then 60, and finally 75 minutes before your big break. Adding too much too soon—or working in too-large chunks all the way through—defeats one of the main purposes of the technique, which is to not get overwhelmed, so taking it slower and easier while still adding on time is the best bet.If you're not sure how much time to add on, familiarize yourself with the concept of flowtime. Also known as \"flowmodoro,\" the idea here is that you should track how long you can work on a given task before you feel drained, track how long your breaks need to be to make you feel reenergized, and start creating custom, Pomodoro-esque work and rest blocks for every kind of task you do in a given day. It takes a bit of data collection and planning, but it can help you master the general technique while still prioritizing deep work and breaks.Why use Pomodoro 2.0?The Pomodoro technique shines (and has been so popular for so long) because it helps you ease into your work, motivated by the small work sprints and promise of rewards. It's absolutely true that you need to take breaks to keep your productivity up, so that part should never be altered or skipped, but sometimes, 25-minute grind sessions just aren't enough and five minutes to reset isn't, either. Getting into a state of deep work takes time. Repeatedly stopping yourself before you hit that point is counter-productive. Giving yourself more time to work on harder, more complex tasks is critical in some instances, just like taking breaks. Adding time to the work blocks in increments helps you settle in and get more done without overwhelming yourself. You should consider this alteration if you have a major project that demands a lot of resources or energy, letting yourself build up to the hard parts as you add minutes to your timer. If you're trying this out and not getting the results you want, you can shake it up another way, too. Remember the idea of \"eating the frog,\" or tackling your biggest to-do list item first thing in the morning? Consider eating the frog in Pomodoro 2.0, starting with your 75-minute block and working backward to 60, 45, and 30. Remember, none of these rules are hard and fast; you can make changes that match your needs and personal preferences. If you're someone who doesn't get overwhelmed and has the ability to jump in on long-term work, this structure could suit you, as the promise of shorter and shorter work sessions can feel like a motivator of its own. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Holiday shopping season is ripe for scammers, as consumers rush to find and take advantage of some of the best discounts of the year, and potentially overlook red flags that signal fraud. Security researchers are warning of an uptick in scams capitalizing on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype. Fraudsters know that they can prey on shoppers' sense of urgency and excitement for limited-time, exclusive deals—and AI is making these campaigns even more difficult to spot than usual. New data from McAfee suggest that nearly half of Americans have come across an AI-powered scam while shopping, from deepfakes impersonating celebrities pushing promotions to near-flawless spoofed websites that steal your credit card information. Here are the scams to watch for this Black Friday. \nSpoofed websites are a common type of a scam, and fraudsters use holiday shopping season to trap users with fake retail sites and sales pages that look legitimate but are actually just collecting data like your login credentials and payment information. Scammers will use stolen assets like logos and product photos from known and trusted brands, and AI makes it easy to set up a convincing (but fake) small business website with elements like a customer service page and consumer reviews in no time. Another shopping scam facilitated by AI is the impersonation scam. You think you're watching a popular influencer or celebrity promoting an exclusive deal or product giveaway on TikTok or another social media platform, but it's actually a deepfake. If you click through to enter or buy, you'll land on a counterfeit page (as outlined above) designed to steal from you. According to Google's November fraud and scam advisory, scammers can get eyes on their content by hijacking search terms for Black Friday sales, running deceptive ads, or pushing deals on social media. Fake storefronts may appear as sponsored links, which are easy to overlook if you're in a rush to make a purchase. Of course, you may encounter other common holiday scams, such as fake shipping notifications that request payment in order to resolve a delivery issue as well as account verification scams that prompt you to confirm personal details. These phishing and smishing campaigns use standard scam tactics like impersonating a legitimate company or service and sending a fraudulent link that collects your bank information or username and password combination. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlack Friday scam red flags When shopping holiday deals, slow down enough to look for common signs of scams. Fraudsters will use urgency—such as a limited time to secure a deal or a limited number of items left in stock—in hopes you won't think before you buy. You should also be wary of any deal that is too good to be true, or a promotion with especially low prices that are out of line with other sales on similar items. This includes influencers pushing \"exclusive\" opportunities. If you are purchasing from a small business you don't know, google the brand and read third-party reviews to see whether it is legitimate. Instead of clicking links from emails, texts, and social media posts promoting sales, go directly to the retailer's website and search for the deal. If you do click through, check the URL carefully to ensure it is legitimate (scammers may use homoglyphs that avoid detection at first glance) and look for website elements that real companies have, such as a privacy policy and address. If you see a promotion on social media, check the creator's account to see when they joined the platform, what they've posted in the past, and whether they are verified. Beware of any site that requires you to pay with a gift card, cryptocurrency, or bank transfer versus a credit card, which has some protection in the case of fraud. Legitimate retailers will use legitimate payment methods. Finally, never enter your login credentials unless you've confirmed that the site you're using is trustworthy. This includes delivery services and your Amazon and PayPal accounts, all of which scammers may pressure you to \"verify\" in order to resolve a billing or delivery issue. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        If you've booked a hotel through a platform like Booking.com or Expedia, beware any communication that directs you to confirm your payment details to hold your reservation. Threat actors are targeting the hospitality industry with a phishing campaign designed to steal from travelers. As outlined by security firm Sekoia.io and reported by The Hacker News, the scheme is referred to as \"I Paid Twice\" because hotel customers are eventually conned into handing over their banking information. Scammers contact guests via WhatsApp or email about their booking, saying that they need to verify their payment or risk cancellation. The link goes to a fake landing page that looks like Booking.com or Expedia, where victims are prompted to provide card information. This isn't the first scam to target Booking.com: Scammers have previously spoofed the site to spread malware directly to users via both fake CAPTCHAs and homograph attacks, which exploit similar characters in the URL to redirect to a malicious website. \nThis multi-step campaign actually begins when hackers target hotels themselves with ClickFix attacks, a type of social engineering attack designed to trick users into downloading malware via fake error messages or CAPTCHA forms. (I've covered a handful of ClickFix schemes, such as those spread via AI-generated instructional videos on TikTok and expired invite links on Discord.) The scam runs as follows: Hotel managers receive emails from compromised accounts with phishing links that redirect to a supposed reCAPTCHA page. This is the ClickFix component, as targets are instructed to complete the challenge to \"ensure the security of your connection.\" A couple of redirects lead to the user copy and execute a PowerShell command that downloads a Remote Access Trojan (like PureRAT) to their device. Once the malware has been delivered, it allows threat actors remote access, including control of the mouse and keyboard, data exfiltration, command execution, file uploads and downloads, keylogging, and webcam and microphone capture. Hackers are then able to steal admin credentials to gain access to booking platforms and send the aforementioned phishing emails to hotel guests—or they can sell the information to other cybercriminals. Don't fall for the hotel booking scamYou can't control whether a hotel manager unwittingly hands over access to your booking information. But you can avoid further compromising your personal and financial data by staying vigilant to any unexpected communication about your reservation. A reputable hotel probably won't contact you via a booking platform (nor will the platform itself) to demand payment for holding a reservation you've already confirmed. This sense of urgency is meant to trick you into acting quickly, so if you're not sure what's going on, call the hotel directly using the number on their official website (not from the email or WhatsApp message). Don't click any links, and don't enter any information unless you have confirmed that you are on a legitimate booking platform or hotel website. \n            ",

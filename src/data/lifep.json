But if you happen to be a visual learner, there’s one in particular that might be suited for you: mind mapping. Mind maps are diagrams designed to organize information and data points that relate to each other, making everything you need to do easier to follow. They're particularly popular for students who need to visualize how the concepts they're studying link together, but they have wide applications outside the classroom.What is a mind map?A mind map isn’t just a diagram that lays out tasks. Rather, it does so in a hierarchical way, connecting things that are related and making it clear which need to be done first in order to move on to the next task. (When used for studying, on the other hand, they help bridge connections between main topics and those that branch off from them, plus relate to one another.)\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nYou can use mind maps for a variety of reasons, whether you want to think clearer or set goals with them, but for our purposes, we’ll go over how they can be used as productivity tools. You can also try them for word-associating, brainstorming, note-taking, and more once you get the hang of it.Start by writing the main idea of what you need to do. For instance, if you have to make a new hire, write that right in the center and draw a circle around it. Then, use arrows to branch off into related tasks: HR tasks, onboarding tasks, financial tasks, etc. From each of these, you draw more arrows. HR tasks might involve legal paperwork and background checks. Onboarding may require getting your new hire access to training modules and finding them a workspace. Financial tasks could include setting up payroll and getting them certain benefits enrollment information.After creating the mind map, you’ll see all the tasks laid out in a  web that will help you visualize and grasp everything you need to do. It all leads back to that one main responsibility. The subtasks will equate to all the little things you need to do to make it all happen, piece by piece, until you end up fulfilling that final goal in the center.How to make your own mind mapAbove, we talked about drawing circles, which is fine if you prefer the old paper-and-pen method. You can make them in Word or Google Docs, but those can be clunky. A better option is to use an online creativity tool, like Canva or Draw.io. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAn even better option than that is to use software dedicated to the task. My favorite is Xmind, which you can use on your computer or phone and comes pre-loaded with a bunch of templates. The actual creation process can be helpful for brainstorming, but is a pain if you're not graphically inclined. Xmind makes it a lot easier, especially for beginners, because you just drag and drop the shapes and lines around a canvas designed for this exact purpose.Why this worksThe simplicity of a mind map is what makes it so effective. Keywords, not long phrases, and color-coding lend themselves to quick processing and recall, while the hierarchical nature of the tasks helps you see what order you need to handle them in. The overarching task at the center serves as a reminder of what you're even doing all those little things for, which helps keep you motivated and on track. The simple flow of arrows links ideas and the spacing of the boxes keeps categories organized. Overall, it’s a great solution for visual learners or anyone in a rush, and it’s not as clumsy or convoluted as a large spreadsheet or planning document. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Unlike an LCD, which uses a single backlight for all the pixels of the display, all of the pixels on an OLED display can be individually lit up or turned off entirely. That means dark areas of the screen are inky black, while brighter areas can be selectively illuminated. It just looks fantastic, and if I have the option, I always try to choose it.OLED isn't new tech at this point, and yet, Apple has been slow to adopt it into its products, especially when compared to some of its competitors. The company's first device to feature OLED was the Apple Watch in 2015, then the iPhone X in 2017, whereas every Samsung Galaxy has featured an AMOLED display since the company introduced the line in 2010. The iPhone remained the only product line with OLED for quite some time, until it included them with the M4 iPad Pros. Aside from these products, Apple tends to choose alternative display types for its devices. For certain products, like the iMac, MacBook Air, and most iPads, it still uses LCD. For more \"premium\" devices, like the MacBook Pro, it uses mini-LED, which offers a large number of backlight \"zones.\" This gives these products more contrast than the single backlight of LCD, but not quite as much as OLED. I prefer watching shows and movies on my iPad with mini-LED than my LCD iMac, for example, but I'd always prefer my OLED TV.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple's OLED roadmapAs it turns out, Apple might give me some new OLED options in the future. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is working on bringing OLED to more of its devices. Gurman says that the company is currently testing the tech for the MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Air, all of which now ship with LCD. In addition, the company is reportedly working on an OLED MacBook Pro, which might also ship with a touchscreen.Before you get too excited for an OLED MacBook, Apple is likely starting the OLED rollout with the iPad—specifically, the iPad mini. Gurman's sources say the OLED mini will drop sometime next year, which would mark the first refresh for the device since 2024. While I'd love an OLED Mac, this might be the perfect excuse for me to pick up an iPad mini, which I've long thought of as the most fun of Apple's devices.Gurman isn't sure when Apple will add OLED to the iPad Air, but it won't be with the next refresh. The next-gen iPad Air will likely launch this spring, and will ship with LCD. That's true for the M5 MacBook Air, as well. While Apple is testing OLED for the Air, the next model will be out this spring sporting the same display tech as the M4. An OLED MacBook Air might not hit stores until 2028.If you'll buy any Mac that Apple sells with OLED, you're going to be buying a Pro. That OLED MacBook Pro might even come with a touchscreen, which would be a first for Apple's Mac line. That machine could be out as early as 2026, but Apple could also push them to 2027.Adding OLED to products won't come cheap, though. Gurman suggests that Apple could raise the price of the iPad mini $100, which would drive the starting cost from $499 to $599. When those OLED MacBook Pros come out, they'll also likely be even more expensive than the current Pros, by at least a few hundred dollars. These machines start at $1,999 (14-inch) and $2,499 (16-inch) today, so their OLED, touchscreen counterparts could fetch a high price tag. You probably shouldn't wait for these devices if you need to upgradeIf you're holding out on buying any new Apple tech until the company refreshes those devices with OLED, you're going to be waiting a while—at least, for anything other than the iPad mini. I'd recommend waiting for that particular device, but for the others, it might be a while indeed. If you really need an upgrade, Apple's current iPad Pros ship with OLED, and the mini-LED tech in its MacBook Pros is also excellent. But even the LCDs on its devices look quite good. If you can stomach seeing the backlight when dark elements are on-screen, an iPad Air or MacBook Air will suit you well. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

As he tells it, deep work is a state where you find the ability to focus completely on a demanding task without letting distraction get in your way. If you can get the hang of it, you’ll get more done in less time and ultimately end up feeling more fulfilled. On his website, Newport observes that it’s rare to see someone feel energized and happy after sending emails, but there’s a sense of fulfillment that comes from sustained focus on more meaningful tasks.How do you achieve deep work?Newport draws a distinction between deep work and “shallow work,” or that which can be accomplished while you’re distracted. Deep work is for “cognitively demanding” tasks, whereas shallow work prepares you for deep work. Creating a project deck is deep work. Emailing colleagues to coordinate data for it is shallow work. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIf you’re having a hard time determining what is and is not deep work, Newport has some guidelines. Shallow work tends “to not create new value in the world” and is “easy to replicate.”The key, then, is first sorting your work into deep and shallow categories. Determine which of your tasks are cognitively demanding and valuable and which are “logistical-style” and replicable. Next, plan to devote an hour or an hour and a half to deep-work tasks, then schedule it so you have that time blocked off in your schedule. (As for blocking off your scheduling, familiarize yourself with time boxing and time blocking, which call on you to schedule every minute of your day and input it, moment by moment, into a detailed calendar, all in the name of staying focused.)Finally, when the time comes to get into deep work, eliminate all your distractions. Signal that you’re busy, make sure you’re unavailable in Slack and on the shared calendar, and put your phone on “do not disturb.” Don’t check emails, don’t talk to anyone, don’t look at your devices for anything but work, and commit to only working on your demanding task in the time you allotted for it.The most important element is doing this mindfully and going into your deep work sessions aware that your goal is to accomplish something demanding with no distractions. Emails, notifications, chitchat, and other worries and interruptions are commonplace and pull you away from the task at hand, so purposely cutting them off to get something done will be difficult, but it can turn into a habit, especially once it starts yielding the dual result of accomplishment and fulfillment.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe deep work hackAll of that sounds great in theory, but when you find yourself staring down the hour-and-a-half block you scheduled out, you may not know what to do or where to start. This is where you need the Pomodoro method, a famous productivity technique that asks you to work, uninterrupted, for 25 minutes, take a five-minute break, and repeat the cycle about four times before getting a larger break. You can modify those time blocks a bit to suit your needs, but 25 on and five off are the standard. When you use this approach, deep work starts to come naturally in those working blocks because you know you're getting a reprieve at the end. Deep work is described as a period when work seems to flow smoothly and you barely notice time going by, so 25 minutes may not be quite enough for you (depending on the task at hand), but you can figure it out as you get started incorporating these methods. The most important thing is to be distraction-free. The second most important thing is to remember that breaks are actually a key part of staying productive, so don't skip them altogether. The easiest way to make use of this time-tested technique is, of course, by app. My favorite is FocusPomo, which blocks all your distracting apps while you use it and generates cute, unobtrusive cartoon tomatoes to reward you for finishing work blocks. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

We're still on this clock-changing treadmill, despite legislation that was supposed to eliminate it a few years ago, and despite medical professionals warning that these clock changes are bad for our health. For example, a recent study out of the Stanford School of Medicine found that switching the time back and forth every year probably contributes to increased rates of stroke and obesity. Permanent daylight saving time would be an improvement on that, and permanent standard time would be even better, health-wise. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine published a position paper a few years ago stating that scientific evidence supports the idea \"that the United States should eliminate seasonal time changes in favor of permanent standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology.\"But despite all this, we’ll still have to turn the clocks ahead again in spring. So what ever happened to those bills in Congress aiming to abolish the time changes? \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe most recent attempt to eliminate clock changes failedThe Sunshine Protection Act was a federal bill that would have made daylight saving time permanent. If enacted, it would have taken effect on Nov. 5, 2023, the date that we would otherwise have changed the clocks. The result would be that our winter mornings would stay dark an hour longer than they currently do, but we’d get an hour more of daylight in the winter evenings.The bill passed the Senate in March of 2022, but it wasn't taken up by the House of Representatives. To become law, it would have had to pass the House and then be signed by the president. At this point, that ship has sailed: The Hill reported that people generally like the idea of abolishing clock changes, but that there was no consensus in the House on whether daylight time or standard time should become permanent. Moreover, passing the bill just never seemed to be a high priority for lawmakers. Which time would we stay with if we stopped changing the clocks? We operate on two different times throughout the year: \"standard time\" and \"daylight saving time.\" These even get their own time zones! For example, if a time is marked as \"EST,\" that means eastern standard time, which is different from eastern daylight time. Standard time is the one we use in winter, and daylight saving time is the one we use in summer. The bill mentioned above would have done away with standard time and kept us on daylight saving time year-round. Meanwhile, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has taken the position that we should stay on standard time (that is, winter time) year-round, since screwing with our circadian rhythms twice a year has detrimental effects on our health and safety. If they got their way, we would fall back some year and then never spring forward again. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat about state laws?States have their own ideas about what time it should be. Currently, states are not allowed to switch to permanent daylight saving time, but they are allowed to stay on standard time year-round if they prefer. Two states do so: Hawaii and Arizona (minus the parts of Arizona in the Navajo nation). Nineteen states have passed laws or resolutions that would allow them to switch to permanent daylight saving time if the federal government ever allows them to do so. Those states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, are Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Three other states have made attempts to join the list: Similar bills made it partway through the Kentucky and Ohio legislatures but were not signed into law. California voters have authorized a law that isn’t yet officially on the books.Until a federal law passes, those states are stuck with their current time zones. Current federal law, as passed in 1966, allows states to opt out of daylight saving time (as Hawaii and Arizona have) but does not offer a way for states to make daylight saving time permanent or to choose their own dates for changing the clocks. If you’re sick of time changes, you can always move to one of the territories that don’t observe daylight saving, which include the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Once you add travel into the mix, it can feel impossible. Sure, hotels have fitness centers, but if you've ever gone to one only to learn it's nothing more than a few dumbbells and an ancient treadmill, you know how aggravating those can be. There are two apps I use to stick to my routine and prioritize my health while I'm on the road, but I use them quite differently. ClassPassAfter discovering last month that ClassPass houses a little-known, but varied, selection of at-home workout classes to stream, I happily re-downloaded the app for the first time in years. If you're not familiar, you buy monthly credits that you can redeem at gyms and fitness studios, trading a handful of credits for, say, a yoga or HIIT class. (You can also use it for salon and spa services, which is a cool upgrade that app has gotten since I last used it.)I used it all around my neighborhood in New York City for a month, checking out all the boutique studios near me, and found some I loved and others I was glad I didn't spend full price on a trial class for. But last week, when I was home visiting my mom in North Dakota, I checked ClassPass—and sure enough, yoga, barre, spin, and Pilates classes came up. I hadn't entirely expected it to work; it's one thing for a well-populated location like Manhattan to have a bunch of offerings on there, but Bismarck? Yes, Bismarck! I went to a barre class and it was awesome, exactly what I needed to stay on track with my workout schedule and destress after a disastrous night of airline mishaps. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn the next three months, I'm going to West Virginia, Nebraska, and Mississippi. That's how your vacation schedule looks when you're on a mission to visit all 50 states (and I only have eight to go). According to ClassPass, I'll be able to take a yoga class in Charleston, do HIIT in Omaha, and book time at a pickleball court in Biloxi. All of that beats a hotel fitness center by a mile. Even the smallest cities are well-represented on this app and you can get a real, full class experience wherever you are. PelotonI am a dedicated Peloton user and the app gets daily use from me, even if I'm only using it to track my outdoor walks. If you can't find the time or transportation to get to an in-person class, you have loads of options through Peloton, many of which can be completed in your hotel room, like yoga or stretching.There are guided walks available so you can take yourself on a mindful explorative journey around wherever you are, but you can also find loads of hotels that have Peloton cardio equipment. Usually, the Bikes or other equipment are in a fitness center, but I've seen hotels that even have them available in-room. Even if you can only devote 10 minutes to working out, it's better than nothing and keeps you in your groove, which is why I value the Peloton app so much. I did, of course, use it to track the barre class I took in Bismarck, plus the Les Mills Body Pump and Solidcore classes I took there, too. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Techniques and plans that call for prioritizing your to-dos, for instance, generally expect you to prioritize your to-dos for that day. The best scheduling advice also typically revolves around how you designate and take on chunks of time throughout a single day. But sometimes—or often—you work on things that span a longer period of time, so you need productivity tips that are more expansive too. And while too much pre-planning can feel daunting, there's a method you can start using right away that can help you more effectively structure your time in the longer term. It's called \"task batching.\" What is task batching?At its most basic, task batching is the act of grouping similar tasks or responsibilities together and completing them around the same time. Ideally, you can work on all the tasks at once, somewhat multitasking but still staying in the same frame of mind for all the jobs. Your goal here is to avoid context switching, or changing mental energies between tasks. While it's true that multitasking makes you worse at everything—which is why I've sworn off it—this isn't the same thing.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFor instance, instead of jumping from your inbox to paying bills to taking video meetings to washing dishes to cleaning, you can batch the emails and video calls together, batch the dishes and cleaning together, and save the bills for a different chunk of the day (or the week). Keeping yourself in the same mind frame will help you stay focused instead of allowing your thoughts to be pulled in a bunch of different directions.You already do task batching without thinking about it. When shopping for gifts, for example: Let's say you have to buy new shoes for your kid and your spouse, a gift for your bracelet-loving mother-in-law, one for your necklace-loving sister, and a candle for yourself. At the mall, you wouldn't pick one pair of shoes at Foot Locker, run to the jewelry store for your mother-in-law, head back to Foot Locker for the other shoes, circle back to the jewelry store for your sister's necklace, etc. You'd group these purchases together, getting everything you needed in each store you went into before moving to the next one. If one of the stores was in a different place altogether, you'd probably kick those purchases to a different day. That all just makes sense—and you can apply that same duh logic to your other to-dos.How to batch your tasks effectivelyAt the start of each week, start with your regular to-do list, but then group together the similar things and schedule those groups for specific days. For example, if you need to buy dog food, school supplies, and groceries, schedule a shopping trip for one day of the week. If you have dinner scheduled with a friend and also need to call your mom to ask how her book club went, try to do all those social check-ins on the same day. Writing-intensive work goes in a batch, no matter if it’s for school, work, or pleasure. Personal and professional emails all get handled in one batch. Household tasks go in a batch, whether they’re cleaning or unpacking from a trip.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you have a big party or event coming up, schedule the prep for a single day instead of picking up one necessity one day and another the next. Complete your similar tasks in one day so you can move on and focus on the next group the following day.One key step here is not just pre-scheduling your batches at the beginning of the week, but checking in on their progress as the week goes on. Deadlines can change (or be missed), and what was low-priority on Monday may suddenly be important on Wednesday. Task batching helps you to get more done in big chunks, which frees you up for the unexpected emergencies or responsibilities that might crop up. The reason this works is that it keeps you in \"the zone.\" Instead of getting pulled in a bunch of directions and constantly thinking about the gear-shift necessary in order to move to the next disjointed task, you remain in the flow. On email day, you move through your inbox more quickly because you remain focused on that one task the entire time. On cleaning day, each chore seems less individually daunting because you're crossing off a bunch of them in sequence. When you're in that kind of  flow state, things start to come easier and you can focus more deeply— plus, this strategy allows you to think ahead instead of constantly jumping from responsibility to responsibility. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Sure, the part of the phone you interact with most is the touchscreen, so maybe it doesn't seem like such a big deal. But think about it: The side button, volume buttons, Action button, and Camera Control button would no longer click. Could you live without the clutter? While Apple sells no such iPhone, and likely won't release one next year, it very well might roll out a buttonless iPhone in 2027—at least, physically buttonless.  That year will mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, and it'll come as no surprise that rumors suggest Apple is planning something special for the \"iPhone 20.\" And that something might include ditching all the mechanical buttons and replacing them with haptics.A truly buttonless iPhoneIf you owned an iPhone 7 or iPhone 8, you'll understand the idea here. Those iPhones replaced the mechanical Home button with a solid state haptic button. Essentially, Apple used clever haptic vibrations to create the illusion of a button press, but, in fact, the \"button\" doesn't move at all. You'll realize this if the phone is completely off: The once pressable Home button doesn't actually do anything. It's the same case with any MacBook released over the past decade: Your trackpad isn't actually a button, so when the computer is off, the glass doesn't move.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe suggestion that the iPhone 20 will replace all of its buttons with this type of tech comes from leaker Instant Digital, who has previously claimed Apple intend to build a button-free iPhone. In the past, Instant Digital only confirmed vague plans by Apple to create such a phone sometime in the future, but this week, the leaker was more definitive: In a post on Weibo, Instant Digital asserted that Apple has \"completed functional verification\" for these haptic buttons, and is planning for \"mass production and application\" with the iPhone 20. All of the buttons, from the Side button to the Camera Control buttons, would adopt this technology. Interestingly, Instant Digital claims Apple will bridge the gap by simplifying the structure of the Camera Control button in next year's iPhone 18. Apple might remove the capacitive sensing layer of the button and keep just the pressure sensitivity. We'll have to see whether other rumors confirm this.Would you buy a buttonless iPhone 20?The iPhone 20 unveil is nearly two years away, and all rumors should be taken with a grain of salt. Apple might have big plans in store for this iPhone, but haptic buttons might not have anything to do with them. But let's assume for the sake of argument that Apple does exactly what Instant Digital suggests. Would you buy it?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis would be a fundamentally different experience from any other iPhone, or really, any other smartphone. Even if you once had an iPhone with a haptic Home button, you've always had physical buttons to control the volume, to call up Siri, or to shut down your device. Those experiences would feel different, and could be more difficult to use just by feel alone, unless Apple makes each \"button\" physically obvious. It also calls into question how one would perform any hardware tasks that currently require physical buttons. Once Apple removed the physical Home button, you couldn't use it to reset the iPhone, so Apple gave the volume button that job instead. But if all buttons aren't really buttons anymore, how would you reset the iPhone if the screen becomes unresponsive? Plug it into a computer? Take it to an Apple Store? Say a prayer? My guess is Apple will have a solution, but at the moment, it's not clear what it would be. Personally, I don't think the change would influence my buying decision one way or the other. I'm hopelessly stuck in Apple's ecosystem, so I'll likely upgrade whenever my current iPhone bites the dust. If my options at that point include an iPhone without buttons, so be it, but I wonder if other iPhone users feel the same.

Until Nov. 11, referral codes from existing members get you more money off your hardware purchases. The discount detailsLast month, Peloton rolled out upgraded versions of its fleet, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread+, Tread+, and Row. The new devices are known as the Cross Training series and, as such, are named the Cross Training Bike, Crosstraining Tread+, etc. If you want to know how they differ from the old models, I wrote an explainer here, but the basic gist is that the proprietary touchscreens on which you follow guided classes now swivel around, making it easier to hop off your machine and do, say, a strength or yoga class. The Plus line also comes with a movement-tracking camera that uses AI to correct your form, suggest when it's time to add more weights or reps, and monitor your workouts. As you can assume, these are pricier than their predecessors, which is why the current referral promotion might be of interest to you. If you get a referral code from an existing All-Access Member, here's what you can get off at checkout: $300 (instead of the usual $250) off your cart when you purchase a new Peloton Cross Training Bike$700 off your cart (instead of $500) when you purchase a new Peloton Cross Training Bike+$500 off (instead of $300) when you get a Peloton Cross Training Tread$1,200 off (instead of $600) a purchase of a new Peloton Cross Training Tread+$200 off a new Peloton Cross Training Row+ All the discounts will return to normal after Nov. 11. (Note: This probably isn't the best time to get a Cross Training Row+, as the typical referral discount on that is $300.)Your referrer has to be an All Access Member, not someone who uses one of the less-expensive, app-only versions of Peloton's digital offerings. The referrer can't be renting their machine, their membership can't be paused, and they can't be a Peloton employee. Notice, too, that this specifically applies to new devices. That means you can't use the referral code to get money off a purchase on Peloton's resale platform, Repowered, although that's always a solid option if you're looking for equipment on a budget. You don't have to have the Cross Training series to get a good workout (although I enjoyed my demos of those devices); I have been using the same Peloton Bike for nearly five years and love it—I ride it every day. You can redeem your code on the Peloton website or at Peloton stores. Bear in mind, however, you have to be a new customer. How to find a referral codeIf you want to be the referrer, not the referee, here's how to generate the code that will get you some brownie points with your fitness-focused friends. The easiest way is to go to this link and log into your Peloton account. Otherwise, head to members.onepeloton.com and select the hamburger menu in the top right corner, then hit Refer friends. If you're not seeing that or the link above didn't work, you're not eligible to share a code. You can also do this on your mobile app by tapping the Community tab, then Add Friends on the upper right, then Refer Friends.Remember how I said you'll get brownie points with the people you refer? You get something else, too: You can give out up to $1,200 in referrals, but you also get a free month of your All Access Membership for every person you refer. Once someone makes a purchase with your code, you'll get en email containing a code of your own, plus instructions on how to redeem it, after three to five business days. The voucher codes are valid for three months after their issue date. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n            Staff writer\n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

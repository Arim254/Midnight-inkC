Ever since, texting between iPhone and Android hasn't been a nightmare caused by SMS: Group chats function as they should, photos and videos can be sent in high quality, and you can even see when the other person is typing—though the messages are still green. While the experience is miles better than it used to be, it isn't perfect. There are still some key functions missing from RCS on iPhone. For instance, you can't unsend messages, reply to a thread, or edit iPhone messages. The latter can only happen on the Android side, while only iPhones can react with emojis right now. The biggest omission, however, is support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This is arguably the most important advantage RCS has over SMS. E2EE \"scrambles\" your messages, and only you and the recipient(s) have the \"keys\" to unscramble them. If a hacker were to remotely access your messages from an untrusted device, they wouldn't be able to read them: The only way to see these messages in plain text is to have access to the trusted device associated with them. If you have an Android device, and you text with other Android devices using Google Messages, you likely have this advantage. You may see a small lock icon next to your messages as you send them, indicating that texts are sent with E2EE. iPhones have this advantage when texting other iPhones, as iMessage is E2EE as well. But when you text from an iPhone to an Android, whether or not you're using RCS or SMS, those messages are not protected by encryption, which leaves you vulnerable to hacking. \nEnd-to-end encryption support for RCS is live in the iOS 26.4 betaThat's now changing. Apple is currently testing E2EE support for RCS on iPhone. Not only that, anyone can try it out right now—assuming you're fine taking on the risks of beta software. The change comes with the second beta for iOS 26.4, which Apple released on Monday. Apple's first beta for 26.4 added an initial layer of support, but only for iPhones texting each other with iMessage disabled. The second beta now supports E2EE for RCS communications with Android devices. As long as your Android friends are running the latest version of Google Messages, and you're running the second iOS 26.4 beta, you can rest easy knowing your messages are protected by end-to-end encryption. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, this doesn't mean that those of us waiting for the official iOS 26.4 release will enjoy the same. While beta features are always subject to change, Apple explicitly says in its release notes that, \"This feature is not shipping in this release and will be available to customers in future iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS 26 releases.\" It seems the company is getting a jump on testing in anticipation of a future iOS 26.4.1, iOS 26.5, or maybe even an iOS 27 release. Don't install the iOS 26.4 beta without knowing the risksYou'll need to install the latest beta on your iPhone to give this encryption a try—but don't do that without thinking it through. Beta software is in testing, which means there may be bugs and other instabilities you aren't used to dealing with in iOS. If something goes wrong, and you need to uninstall the beta, you'll need to reset your iPhone entirely. Unless you have a full backup of iOS 26.3 on your computer, you could lose data. As such, I never recommend installing betas on your primary device. It's your choice, of course: Just understand the risks.If you do decide to try the beta, you'll also have access to other new features in iOS 26.4—namely, a new Apple Music experience with an AI playlist generator, fresh design, and the ability to add songs to multiple playlists at once. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.As part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears. While I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.    \nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther new features in this Release Preview Channel updateThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.  You can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.   \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Devices like Ray-Ban Metas come equipped with speakers, a microphone, embedded cameras, and connectivity to your smartphone—all in a package that largely looks like a normal pair of glasses. That's great for enthusiasts who want a hands-free smartphone experience when out and about, but not so great for anyone who dislikes the idea of invisible cameras everywhere.There are two sides to these privacy worries. One is the personal angle. Many of us don't want the people around us shoving their smartphone cameras in our faces when we're out in public, but at least then we'd know we're being recorded. These embedded cameras are tough to spot unless you know what you're looking for, which means there's a feeling of always being watched by anyone walking past wearing glasses. On the other hand, there's the larger privacy concern that comes with the territory of a huge company like Meta. Just last week, we learned the company plans to bring facial recognition tech to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses with a feature called \"Name Tag,\" which would give the wearer insights into the people they encounter using Meta AI. Taken together, smart glasses pose an unprecedented privacy and security risk for those of us living our lives, when both our neighbors and law enforcement have the accessibility to spy on us without our knowledge. Of course, what can you do? If these glasses are legal, and they're relatively inconspicuous, how can you protect yourself from the average Ray-Ban Meta-wearing Joe? By the time you get close enough to tell whether or not they're wearing smart glasses, you're already in view of the camera.\n\"Nearby Glasses\" tells you when someone is wearing smart glasses in your areaEnter \"Nearby Glasses,\" a new app that spills the beans on smart glasses wearers near your location. As reported by 404 Media, the app is made by developer Yves Jeanrenaud, and scans for smart glasses' \"distinctive Bluetooth signatures\" (also known as \"advertising frames\") to identify them in your immediate area. Jeanrenaud was able to use a directory of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) manufacturers to build a list of smart glasses the app can scan for, including devices from Meta, Luxottica Group S.p.A, and Snap. If the app spots one, it sends you a push notification.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe app can't currently distinguish between smart glasses and mixed reality headsets, however. As such, you may get an alert saying there are smart glasses nearby, but because the app picked up the Bluetooth signals from a Meta Quest headset. That said, these are much easier to spot than smart glasses, and are far less likely to be worn inconspicuously in public spaces.

With its latest update, Google Chrome for desktop now has three new productivity features: Split View, PDF annotations, and the ability to save downloads directly to Google Drive. These features are targeted at both regular and enterprise users, the company says, so you don't need to worry about Workspace exclusivity. Let's take a look at each new feature and how you can best use it.Split View lets you boost your productivity\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nOver the years, the internet browser has become a super app of sorts, since it has access to so many useful sites and web apps. In Chrome, I often find myself taking notes while attending meetings online, or keeping a second tab open for research while I write articles. For many people, a single Chrome tab or window is no longer enough, and with that in mind, Google's added Split View to the desktop version of its browser.Split View merges two tabs and displays them in the same window. You can think of it like the split-screen view in old school video games. You can use Split View by right-clicking any tab and selecting Add Tab to New Split View. For now, Chrome allows you to have a maximum of two tabs side by side in Split View, although I hope you'll eventually be able to add more in the future. In its current form, the feature is great for using Google Docs while watching an educational video, or similar two-tab use cases. Finally, no more opening single tabs in separate windows and then resizing them into your own, makeshift split view.\nYou can easily drag the slider in between the two tabs to give one tab more screen space than the other. Or for more control, you can click the Split View button to the left of the address bar and select the Arrange Split View menu (this is also available if you right click the merged tabs in your tab bar). This is an easy way to quickly reverse the order of the two tabs, separate them, or close just one of the tabs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate PDFs in Chrome\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLet's be honest: Chrome is probably the PDF viewer that most people use. No matter how many fancy PDF editing apps I or my colleagues recommend, for the most part, you're going to search for and open PDFs in your browser. Luckily, now you no longer have to use a different app for basic annotations. Chrome's desktop PDF Viewer now has tools for highlighting text, adding notes, and even making digital signatures. You're still going to need a different app for advanced PDF edits, but Chrome is now capable enough to handle the basics.Save PDF files directly to Google Drive\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhenever you download a PDF file using Google Chrome, it defaults to saving them to the Downloads folder on your computer, or to another location on your hard drive. On desktop, Google now lets you save these files directly to your Google Drive account. This can be very useful if you want to keep your local storage clear. When you open a PDF file in Chrome, you'll see a Google Drive icon in the toolbar, next to the download button. Clicking the Google Drive icon will automatically save it to the cloud storage service, in a new folder called \"Saved from Chrome.\"\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

One person is also missing, but presumed dead. This story is tragic, but, miraculously, six members of the group survived the disaster. According to the New York Times, those skiers were rescued thanks to a standard iPhone feature, Emergency SOS via satellite, which let them connect to emergency services from where they were trapped by snow. If you have an iPhone, you probably have this feature available to you, as well. Better yet, it's not hard to activate in the event of an emergency, though it doesn't hurt to know exactly how it works ahead of time. This isn't the first time Emergency SOS via satellite was credited with saving lives during disasters, and knowing about it now could potentially save your life in a future emergency. What is Emergency SOS via satellite?You might be familiar with your iPhone's Emergency SOS feature—you may have even set it off accidentally when clicking the buttons too many times in a row. Emergency SOS makes it easy to quickly dial 911 in the event of an emergency. \nBut Emergency SOS via satellite is different. This feature connects you to emergency services when you're in an area with no cellular service. Where a typical 911 call would route through your carrier's network, Emergency SOS via satellite connects your call or message to the nearest satellite above your head. That means, so long as conditions are right, you're able to contact emergency services from basically anywhere in the world, regardless of whether that area is covered by cell networks. Of course, since communications are being routed via satellite, the experience is much different than a standard cellular connection. Apple says that in \"ideal conditions\" with a clear sky, it might take 30 seconds for messages to send. Less ideal conditions, say, if your view of the sky is blocked by trees, could slow a message down to 60 seconds or more.   Apple first launched this feature with the iPhone 14, but since iOS 18, you've been able to text anyone via satellite. The principle is the same, but you can reach out to friends and family rather than 911. If there's an emergency, but not one you need police, fire fighters, or EMTs for, this can connect you to close friends no matter where you are. How to use Emergency SOS via satelliteTo connect to satellite with your iPhone, you'll need an iPhone 14 or later. You'll also need to be running iOS 16.1 in the U.S. and Canada, though other regions have their own software requirements. The feature is currently available in the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S.You won't have the option to connect to satellite services when you have a connection, either cellular or wifi. Instead, the option appears when you have no service. Once this happens, iOS' Connection Assistant will ask if you want to connect to satellite. If you miss the prompt, you can launch it from the Cellular tile in Control Center, or from Settings > Satellite.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce the Connection Assistant launches, it'll walk you through connecting to your nearest satellite, including with on-screen visuals, but here's the gist: You'll need to be outside with as clear a view of the sky as you can. Apple says that \"light\" to \"medium\" foliage from trees could slow down messages, while \"dense\" foliage, hills, mountains, or tall structures could prevent connection at all. Apple says you can hold your iPhone as you usually would—no need to point it at the sky—but you may be instructed to move left or right depending on the location of the satellite. Apple also says the connection might not work in places above 62° latitude, which includes northern parts of Alaska.Once connected, the first thing you should do is try calling 911. The call might go through even over satellite, but if it doesn't, you'll find the option to send an \"Emergency Text.\" Tap this option, then choose the appropriate services (roadside assistance or emergency services.). You can also open the Messages app, text 911, then choose \"Emergency Services.\" Here, tap \"Report Emergency,\" then answer questions when prompted to describe the situation you're in. You can also choose to automatically notify emergency contacts that you contacted 911. From here, your iPhone shares all this information, along with your location, remaining iPhone battery life, and Medical ID (if set up), with responders. Is Emergency SOS via satellite free?Yes! (For now.) Since its launch, Emergency SOS via satellite has been free to use, though Apple officially says that the feature is free for two years after an iPhone is activated. The company pushed back that deadline for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users last year, so no iPhone has actually had to pay for the feature yet. The company might continue to push it back, or begin charging, but there's no word on pricing at this time. It's worth noting T-Mobile has its own satellite feature, as well. If you have the service, and an iPhone 13 or later, you could use their satellite connectivity services instead.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The vulnerability was related to Markdown support, which was added last year. Markdown is a simple way to add formatting, including links, to plaintext documents—and links were the source of the vulnerability.\"An attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files,\" according to the security response notice. Markdown has long been popular in certain parts of the internet—anyone who occasionally comments on Reddit or chats using Discord is likely at least a little familiar with it. But the markup language has become even more important in the age of AI—most documents are converted to plain text Markdown files to train models.\nMicrosoft is patching more bugs than ever in Windows 11Markdown support was added around the same time Copilot was integrated into Notepad, as part of a broader push to add AI to every corner of the operating system. And there's an argument to be made that all these AI additions are adding up to new vulnerabilities. Microsoft patched 1,129 bugs in 2025 according to Krebs on Security, a prominent cybersecurity blog. That's an 11.9% increase over the previous year, which was already unusually high. Microsoft itself admits that AI agents will open up new vulnerabilities, even as the company adds them to Windows.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis is all to say that installing security updates is likely more important now than ever. Sure, you could disable all AI features in Windows, but that's unlikely to protect you from all the new vulnerabilities—installing Linux might, though.How to patch this Notepad vulnerability \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nLuckily for Windows users, this vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft's February 2026 security update. To find out if you've installed it, open the Settings app, head to \"Windows Update,\" then check if an update labeled \"2026-02 Security Update\" is waiting to be installed.

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes. Thankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Samsung’s brightest OLED TV thus far, released in 2025, is the S95F, praised for its picture quality and surprisingly impressive sound. Right now, a 65-inch refurbished Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV is just $1,899, which is over $1,000 off its list price.\nThis TV's deep blacks, dramatic contrast, and “very bright OLED panel”, as PCMag describes it, are the standout features on this large-screen 4K TV. Beyond improved brightness that maxes out at a striking 2,386 nits, it also features fantastic color performance and a powerful, advanced 4.2.2-channel speaker system that reduces the need for an external speaker or soundbar. The TV has a nearly bezel-less design and a One Connect box to minimize cable clutter.The S95F also has some of the best anti-glare tech, which is rare for an OLED. While the LG G5 is technically brighter, its anti-glare system doesn’t perform as well. The S95F’s matte anti-reflection coating drastically reduces glare and is designed specifically to perform well in bright rooms, which is a major perk if the room your TV is in gets a lot of daylight. It supports HDR10 and HDR10+ content at 120Hz, with up to 165Hz variable refresh rate  and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.  Like other Samsung TVs, this one doesn’t support Dolby Vision.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe TV is covered by Woot’s 90-day limited warranty, and ships free for Amazon Prime users (otherwise, shipping is $6). Since it’s refurbished, it may have minimal signs of wear, but that won’t affect performance.\n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

OpenAI officially deprecated GPT-4o on Friday, despite the model's particularly passionate fan base. This news shouldn't have been such a surprise. In fact, the company announced that Feb. 13 would mark the end of GPT-4o—as well as models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini—just over two weeks ago. However, whether you're one of the many who are attached to this model, or you simply know how dedicated 4o's user base is, you might be surprised OpenAI actually killed its most agreeable AI. This isn't the first time the company depreciated the model, either. OpenAI previously shut down GPT-4o back in August, to coincide with the release of GPT-5. Users quickly revolted against the company, some because they felt GPT-5 was a poor upgrade compared to 4o, while others legitimately mourned connections they had developed with the model. The backlash was so strong that OpenAI relented, and rereleased the models it had deprecated, including 4o.   If you're a casual ChatGPT user, you might just use the app as-is, and assume the newest version tends to be the best, and wonder what all the hullabaloo surrounding these models is all about. After all, whether it's GPT-4o, or GPT-5.2, the model spits out generations that read like AI, complete with flowery word choices, awkward similes, and constant affirmations. 4o, however, does tend to lean even more into affirmations than other models, which is what some users love about it. But critics accuse it of being too agreeable: 4o is at the center of lawsuits accusing ChatGPT of enabling delusional thinking, and, in some cases, helping users take their own lives. As TechCrunch highlights, 4o is OpenAI's highest-scoring model for sycophancy.   \nI'm not sure where 4o's most devoted fans go from here, nor do I know how OpenAI is prepared to deal with the presumed backlash to this deprecation. But I know it's not a good sign that so many people feel this attached to an AI model. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.WhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.Speaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: WhatsApp\n                    \n    \nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.Still, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.WhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.AI assistants are coming to CarPlay in iOS 26.4As spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.According to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant. \nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstall the iOS 26.4 at your own riskThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all.

His journalism career started in print media, where he contributed to and edited several technology magazines and bookazines sold in the U.K. and internationally. More recently, he has worked as a freelancer for some of the biggest technology publications on the web, covering everything from on-the-ground reporting about product launches, to detailed explainers and how-to guides on apps, gadgets, and platforms.

On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.If you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n    \n            \n            You can mute some or all of your phone's notifications when driving.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.On both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.Other Android Auto notification settingsAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.When you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.There are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n    \n            \n            You can control how messages appear on your dashboard.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.It's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.You should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices. What's new with Samsung's February security updateSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.     Not all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear. \nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to install Samsung's February security updateOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now.

Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.  Based on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem.

With these three steps combined, your general security is pretty much set. But how you make those passwords matters just as much as making each strong and unique. As such, please don't use an AI program to generate your passwords.If you're a fan of chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, it might seem like a no-brainer to ask the AI to generate passwords for you. You might like how they handle other tasks for you, so it might make sense that something seemingly so high-tech yet accessible could produce secure passwords for your accounts. But LLMs (large language models) are not necessarily good at everything, and creating good passwords just so happens to be among those faults.AI-generated passwords are not secureAs highlighted by Malwarebytes Labs, researchers recently investigated AI-generated passwords, and evaluated their security. In short? The findings aren't good. Researchers tested password generation across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, and discovered that the passwords were \"highly predictable\" and \"not truly random.\" Claude, in particular, didn't fare well: Out of 50 prompts, the bot was only able to generate 23 unique passwords. Claude gave the same password as an answer 10 times. The Register reports that researchers found similar flaws with AI systems like GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, and even Nano Banana Pro. (Gemini 3 Pro even warned the passwords shouldn't be used for \"sensitive accounts.\") \nThe thing is, these results seem good on the surface. They look uncrackable because they're a mix of numbers, letters, and special characters, and password strength identifiers might say they're secure. But these generations are inherently flawed, whether that's because they are repeated results, or come with a recognizable pattern. Researchers evaluated the \"entropy\" of these passwords, or the measure of unpredictability, with both \"character statistics\" and \"log probabilities.\" If that all sounds technical, the important thing to note is that the results showed entropies of 27 bits and 20 bits, respectively. Character statistics tests look for entropy of 98 bits, while log probabilities estimates look for 120 bits. You don't need to be an expert in password entropy to know that's a massive gap. Hackers can use these limitations to their advantage. Bad actors can run the same prompts as researchers (or, presumably, end users) and collect the results into a bank of common passwords. If chatbots repeat passwords in their generations, it stands to reason that many people might be using the same passwords generated by those chatbots—or trying passwords that follow the same pattern. If so, hackers could simply try those passwords during break-in attempts, and if you used an LLM to generate your password, it might match. It's tough to say what that exact risk is, but to be truly secure, each of your passwords should be totally unique. Potentially using a password that hackers have in a word bank is an unnecessary risk.It might seem surprising that a chatbot wouldn't be good at generating random passwords, but it makes sense based on how they work. LLMs are trained to predict the next token, or data point, that should appear in a sequence. In this case, the LLM is trying to choose the characters that make the most sense to appear next, which is the opposite of \"random.\" If the LLM has passwords in its training data, it may incorporate that into its answer. The password it generates makes sense in its \"mind,\" because that's what it's been trained on. It isn't programmed to be random.It's not hard to make a secure passwordMeanwhile, traditional password managers are not LLMs. Instead, they are designed to produce a truly random sequence, by taking cryptographic bits and converting them into characters. These outputs are not based on existing training data and follow no patterns, so the chances that someone else out there has the same password as you (or that hackers have it stored in a word bank) is slim. There are plenty of options out there to use, and most password managers come with secure password generators.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut you don't even need one of these programs to make a secure password. Just pick two or three \"uncommon\" words, mix a few of the characters up, and presto: You have a random, unique, and secure password. For example, you could take the words \"shall,\" \"murk,\" and \"tumble,\" and combine them into \"sH@_llMurktUmbl_e.\" (Don't use that one, since it's no longer unique.)Passkeys may be even more secure than passwordsIf you're looking to boost your personally security even further, consider passkeys whenever possible. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: With passkeys, your device is your password. You use its built-in authentication to log in (face scan, fingerprint, or PIN), which means there's no password to actually create. Without the trusted device, hackers won't be able to break into your account. Not all accounts support passkeys, which means they aren't a universal solution right now. You'll likely need passwords for some of your accounts, which means abiding by proper security methods to keep things in order. But replacing some of your passwords with passkeys can be a step up in both security and convenience—and avoids the security pitfalls of asking ChatGPT to make your passwords for you.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

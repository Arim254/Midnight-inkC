It's always at hand, can capture photos, videos, and voice notes as well as text, and is able to log locations, trips and more. Its new AI tools can even draft a few entries automatically for you.What's more, your phone probably now comes with a journal app preinstalled: Apple's Journal app launched in 2023, and a brand new Journal app from Google, initially exclusive to the Pixel 10, is now available on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 too (apparently because these phones also have Gemini Nano on board). Plus, a wide selection of third-party options is available on the Android and iOS app stores.In recent days, in an attempt to determine whether or not journaling on my phone might be for me, I've tested out both the Apple and Google offerings, as well as some of the best third-party alternatives. Here's what I found, and which apps I'd recommend if you want to log your thoughts and feelings on your phone.\nThe built-in optionsJournal by AppleLet's start with Journal by Apple, launched in December 2023. It's fair to say there haven't been a ton of updates released for the app since then, but all of the essentials are covered: Your journal entries can combine text, photos, videos, audio, locations, and sketches, and you can even set up multiple journals for different purposes.I do like the way this app makes suggestions for journaling, particularly in terms of recent locations and photos—it means it's easier to get started or to jump back in after a while. There are also a good number of options for what you can attach to your journal entries, and I can see myself using the mood slider a lot.\n    \n            \n            Journaling with Apple.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJournal by GoogleAs for the Journal app that Google recently launched for Android, it is limited to those with a phone from the Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 series. It's also pretty bare bones: I was able to log text, photos, videos, and places, as well as fitness data collected through Health Connect, but there's nothing here for audio or moods.In addition, the interface is rather plain—much more spartan than the Apple equivalent. You do get a neat overview of all your posts, but it's not particularly inspiring, and you can't configure multiple journals. In addition, the AI-powered prompts for what to write about remain exclusive to Pixel 10 handsets, so you have to do without these on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9.\n    \n            \n            Google's Journal app sticks to the basics.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNeither of these are bad apps; each will do the job of getting down your thoughts in a digital format, with some useful extras attached. The biggest benefits are they're both well integrated into their respective operating systems, and you don't need new accounts to use them. Apple's journal app is certainly better than Google's at the moment, though it's had a two-year head start.If you just want something quick and simple that's made by the company that made your phone (and that may well come preinstalled on your phone), then they're fine. However, these two journal apps remain rather bare bones compared to the other options, as well as keeping you locked in on either Android or iOS. That's why, if you're serious about your journaling, I think it's worth exploring a third-party app installed.The best third-party journal appsDay One\n    \n            \n            Day One was one of the first mobile journals to appear.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOutside of Google and Apple, Day One (Android and iOS) has long been one of the best journaling apps around—and you can take it with you if you ever jump between the Apple and Google platforms. It's been around since 2011 and is stacked with features, including multiple view types, prompts, tags, summaries, recaps, and a gorgeous design that looks great on every device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYour entries can include all the usual features, plus weather details, playlists, health data, social media posts, and more. You get a lot for free, but there is also a premium plan available for $50 a year. It gives you support for unlimited images, videos, and audio, plus extras like the ability to create journal entries over email.5 Minute Journal\n    \n            \n            5 Minute Journal focuses on positivity.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAs someone just dipping a toe into the world of journaling, 5 Minute Journal (Android and iOS) appeals right from the name. The idea is you don't have to spend too long jotting down your thoughts and ideas each day, and the app is geared towards getting you to record the more positive aspects of your life, boosting mindfulness and well-being.I like the writing prompts and journaling reminders this app provides to keep you motivated, as well as the really simple way you can log your mood as you go. It's also a beautifully designed and organized app—a completely different aesthetic experience than a more utilitarian option like Google Journal. However, some features (including unlimited photos and videos) requires a premium subscription, which starts at $5 a month.Rosebud Journal\n    \n            \n            Rosebud comes with a few AI prompt extras.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne more recommendation from my own experience: Rosebud (Android and iOS). It's branded as \"AI-powered\" but thankfully you don't have to worry too much about that, and it does a really nice job of summarizing and tracking your thoughts over time, as well as encouraging you to jot stuff down in the here and now.The app does quite a bit of hand-holding and prompting, but that's perfect if you're just getting started or struggling to journal each day, and you can always just  jot down standard journal entries with text and images if you prefer. As you might have guessed given the other options on my list, there is a pro-level subscription for $13 a month that gives you a lot more insights in terms of past entries, trends, and emotional patterns and triggers, if an AI's summary of your life is interesting to you.The best journal app is the one you useOne of the benefits of there being so many journal apps out there is that there really is something for everyone, so there's no harm in testing out Google and Apple's offerings first—they are, after all, completely free. But for journaling apps that really invest in user design and features, there are much better options out there. Now I just need to pick the one I'm going to stick with, because in the end, the best journal app is the one that you use consistently. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It’s quietly undercutting them. At $699 for the unlocked 512GB Arctic Dawn model, down from $849, it’s currently at its lowest price according to price trackers, making a strong case for itself if you’ve been eyeing an Android phone with top-tier specs without crossing the $1,000 threshold. \nIt runs on the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with 16GB RAM, includes a massive 6.82-inch ProXDR OLED display that stays readable even in direct sunlight, and delivers all-day battery life. Add in 80W wired charging (with the charger actually in the box) and a surprisingly premium build with IP68/IP69 protection, and you start to wonder why this phone isn’t getting more buzz. It also supports wireless charging, but you’ll need to buy OnePlus’ AirVOOC charger separately, notes this PCMag review.Performance-wise, it holds its own. Whether you’re juggling dozens of apps or pushing it with demanding games, the OnePlus 13 barely breaks a sweat. Plus, its 120Hz refresh rate makes everyday scrolling feel extra smooth. On the connectivity side, you get wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, and support for advanced audio codecs like LDAC and LHDC 5.0, which is great news for wireless headphone users. OnePlus’ ongoing collaboration with Hasselblad anchors the camera setup of the OnePlus 13, and this year, all three rear lenses are 50MP—main, telephoto, and ultra-wide. Color reproduction leans natural, not oversaturated, which is great if you prefer photos that don’t need major editing. Software updates won’t go as long as Pixel or Galaxy phones, which might be a dealbreaker if you plan to keep your phone for years. And it doesn’t have a microSD card slot, so the 512GB you get is all you’ll have. But if you want top-tier performance, clean design, and unbeatable battery life for the price, the OnePlus 13 is one of the best values out there right now.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday When you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ Black Friday tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it is the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily bad, impulse buyers may not realize what they're purchasing.How to tell if a Black Friday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.In order to avoid a low-key scam, you should do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). The bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time.

The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Scammers love to impersonate government and law enforcement officials, from the FBI to the U.S. Marshals Service to Medicare and other health insurance programs. There's a good reason for this: Most Americans use government services at some point, and many may be apt to trust, or at least engage with, someone claiming to be from a well-known agency. Plus, the threat of losing benefits or being targeted by legal action is especially compelling when it comes from a government representative, and victims may be more likely to comply with scammers' demands. It's no surprise, then, that schemes currently making the rounds involve Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits, according to warnings from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Social Security numbers are often part of identity theft, so it would be alarming to receive a notice that yours has been involved in criminal activity. Scammers are counting on this when impersonating the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and trying to trick you into actually giving up your SSN and other sensitive information.  \nHere's how the scheme works: Fraudsters are sending emails with the subject line \"Alert: Social Security Account Issues Detected\" and including attachments on letterhead that looks like it comes from the OIG. The notice contains official-seeming information, such as a reference number and case ID, and states that your SSN will be suspended within 24 hours due to fraudulent activity on your account. The letter also says that criminal charges have been filed and even includes the statutes that have supposedly been violated. Recipients are instructed to call the number listed to \"respond to these allegations,\" but the person on the other end is a scammer impersonating an SSA employee. They will try to exploit your fear and confusion to collect personal and financial information from you. VA benefits overpayment scamScammers are also contacting veterans and military family members who receive VA benefits, claiming that said benefits have been overpaid and pressuring targets to pay back the money owed. According to the VA's advisory, fraudsters are using fake VA letterhead and logos on notices sent by mail and email as well as spoofing real VA phone numbers. They are trying to convince beneficiaries to make payments immediately using methods like wire transfers, cryptocurrency, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards, and they may also request sensitive information your VA login or bank account credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile VA benefits could legitimately be overpaid, the VA won't contact you and demand money—especially via bitcoin and other unrecoverable methods. Nor should you ever have to pay an upfront fee for assistance with managing VA debts and claims (the VA does this for free). If you do actually owe money, you will be able to find more information on repayment through your official VA.gov account. Always verify through official VA channels, such as VA.gov and the VA’s Debt Management Center (800-827-0648). Never rely solely on unsolicited communication, and never give out your password, SSN, or financial information. Government agencies don't send threatening notices via email (or by any other means), so if you receive a scary letter out of the blue, don't act without investigating. Always contact the agency via the information found on its website—don't call or text any number provided in these notices.   \n            ",

You can now pick this versatile, reliable streaming box for $74.99 on Amazon, down from its original price of $99.99.\nLifehacker's review of the device highlights the smoothness of the user interface, the wealth of onboard storage, the bonus of having an Ethernet port (for steady internet access), and the benefits of the improved remote control—which you can actually make sound an alarm if you lose it. (Invaluable!)I've been using and loving Google TV for years, and the Google Streamer is a great way to access it. I like its broad support for multiple streaming apps, and the way it combines all those apps together—making it easy to see what you're currently watching. You can add to your watchlist from all across Google apps and services too, including Google Search.The streaming box and its associated remote are available in either Porcelain or Haze, so you can pick whichever matches your personal taste and internal decor. This 25% Black Friday discount may not last, so if you're interested, I'd recommend getting this bought as soon as possible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

This year, Amazon's Black Friday deal event is taking place from Nov. 20-28, and Lifehacker will be here with all the best deals throughout the mega-sale. Right now, one of them is on my absolute favorite headphones for running—the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. They're currently $124.95, a 31% discount off their list price of $179.95.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the world of bone conduction headphones (BCH), let me try to convert you. I love noise-cancelling tech when I'm in the gym, sure. But when I'm exercising outside, I'm grateful for BCH technology to keep my ears open to traffic, other runners, and reckless cyclists—all without sacrificing audio quality. As my colleague Daniel Oropeza reviews in-depth here, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are the best set of BCHs that either of us have ever tried.With these Shokz, I've experienced little to no ear fatigue, even during 20+ mile runs. I've worn these headphones for over a year now, through humid summer runs and unexpected downpours, and they're holding up great. Most important for me, their battery life holds up, lasting even my longest training runs. Even if I forget to charge the night before a run, a quick five-minute charge gives me around 1.5 hours of listening time. Shokz is a go-to brand for a reason, and this 31% discount could be the nudge you need to snag the OpenRun Pro 2 headphones for yourself.If you're still shopping around, I recommend checking out guides like our live blog, where we use price trackers to make sure you're really getting the best deals this Black Friday. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and sales run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

I recently used AI to incorporate her art into physical gifts. If you want to achieve the same quality with a meaningful family photo, here's how you can utilize Adobe's new upscaling features to get the best results.\nFor this process, I used Adobe Firefly and Photoshop. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's generative AI application, and the company released a phone app this summer to help you create on the go. If you're a total newbie to Firefly, you can just ask the app for help along the way. Photoshop, which has long been the gold standard for image editing, recently added an AI upscaling feature that can improve scanned photos or images with the click of a button. Here's how I did it.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nHow I used Adobe AI features to make giftsI started by using Adobe Firefly to visualize my mom’s art on various products, including aprons, scarves, and even dresses. Seeing mockup options helped me decide on an apron as the perfect first piece.Next, I brought an image of an original painting into Photoshop and used the AI upscaling feature. Wearables require a much larger print size, and this step ensures every detail stays crisp and vibrant. I then uploaded the file to Printful, a print-on-demand platform. You can also use Printify or a different print-on-demand provider, as the process is nearly identical.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn just a few clicks, the apron was ready to print and ship directly, and it was such a pleasure to see my mom wear her own artwork.

Not only can you save yourself from more expensive heating bills with thoughtful weatherproofing, but you can also be more confident in the event of winter storms or simply more comfortable when you choose to stay indoors. Keeping your house warm, cozy, and safe for the winter is made easier by addressing potential problems early through simple checks and chores now. Here are all the home maintenance tasks you should do in November.1) Add vent covers to your vents and crawlspacesWhen the weather gets colder, wild animals seek a good place to shelter for the winter. If you have uncovered vents or crawl spaces, they can prove to be an inviting spot for creatures. To keep them out, see that you have vent covers in place and that crawl spaces or any other exterior nooks and crannies are sealed up or covered with a sturdy metal mesh. If you don't have vent covers installed, consider adding them. This method will help defend against squirrels, raccoons, rats, mice, birds, and bats.2) Change the batteries in your fire and carbon monoxide alarmsIf you have non-wired smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, change the batteries once a year—even before they begin making the annoying low-battery beep, if you're up for it. While you're at it, check your various hazard detection systems to ensure they work properly. Since people spend more time indoors during the colder months, there is an elevated risk of fire from the use of heaters, candles, and cooking. Additionally, keeping windows closed and sealed can increase the risk of carbon monoxide accumulation inside. Giving your detectors a once-over can help reduce your risk.\n3) Install weatherproofing to doors and windowsIf you live in an older home or have windows or doors that aren’t well-insulated, November is a good time to weatherproof problem areas. Begin by inspecting the weatherstripping around doors and windows, checking for leaks, broken, or worn stripping. If you find any gaps, use replacement weather stripping to seal them. If you have bigger leaks around windows or doors, or older windows that let in too much air, you can also use a weatherization kit to temporarily seal off leaky openings with heat-shrinking plastic wrap. This basic weatherproofing will keep you warmer and help save money on utility bills.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n4) Organize your winter weather suppliesIf you live in an area that can get a lot of snow and ice in the winter, stock up on ice melt, shovels, and roof rakes. Take a look at your snow removal tools and make sure they’re in good shape before it’s time to use them, as replacing equipment before a storm can save you a lot of headache later. It's also a good time to stash your ice scraper, snow brush, and snow chains in your car's trunk. If you live in an area with heavy snowfall and ice, consider keeping a scraper and de-icer in your garage or utility room, so you can access them if your vehicle becomes frozen over.5) Clean ovens, toasters, and other crumb-catching appliancesKitchen fires can be caused by ovens, toasters, and other cooking appliances that have crumbs and other burnt food deposits. Since people tend to stay home and use their ovens more during colder months—not to mention entertain more during the holiday season—ovens and toasters can get a more intense workout this time of year. Checking that your appliances are clean and hazard-free in November can save you from a disaster down the road, not to mention that you'll be happier with cleaner appliances and less work during spring cleaning season.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

I stumbled upon this older one by Epicka and bought it almost without thinking, something I rarely do. That turned out to be one of my best purchase decisions ever, because that travel adapter is still going strong. I've taken it to multiple countries and have used it extensively while traveling to remote locations in India, where you don't always have a reliable power supply. Last year, I gave it away to a friend I met during a meditation retreat, and she's been happily using it since then.This is the first time I've had a travel adapter for that long. I'd bought a few crappy ones before and they couldn't always reliably charge multiple devices or last very long. This Epicka unit was quite impressive in that regard, but it did have a couple of limitations. It was a fairly slow charger, and it had only one USB-C port. I've been looking to upgrade to a better travel adapter for about a year now, and I think I'm going to do it this time. Epicka has another model with three USB-C ports and support for up to 75W charging, which makes it ideal for me. That one is now down to its lowest ever price in an early Black Friday deal.\nEven at the deal price of $45 (15% off), it is a bit pricey, but I think the premium is worth paying for a fast charger from a brand with a good track record. I will say that this product is a bit bulky and some people will prefer to travel with a more compact charging adapter, but its size never bothered me much. You also get two USB-A ports (one on each side) in this adapter, which is good for those with older charging cables.This Epicka universal travel adapter has a 4.8 rating on Amazon, with a total of 336 reviews at time of writing. The general consensus among Amazon reviewers is that this is a great product. One review says that if you charge multiple devices, this adapter splits power evenly across the devices, which means that all devices will be charged reasonably quickly. It has plugs for the US, UK, Australia, and EU, and a nice locking mechanism to keep the plugs in place.Note, though, that if you're planning to use high-wattage electronics such as hair dryers with this adapter, then it's not for you. This adapter is also not a voltage converter, so be sure to check if your electronics ship with a built-in converter when using the Epicka adapter in other countries. Most phone and laptop chargers are dual voltage, so you probably won't have to worry about it much, but safety first.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

But sometimes a company saves a few special things for later, and that turned out to be the case here: These two brand-new watches, released earlier this year, are now both $100 off. I've used and reviewed the Forerunner 570, and found it a step up from the earlier Forerunner 265 (which I also loved). The 570 adds a microphone and two different types of voice assistants, plus some new software features like heat acclimation and the ability to trim your activity if you didn't press \"stop\" when you crossed the race finish line. My only complaint is (or was) that the price seemed a bit steep in comparison to the previous model. But with the current deal, it's a lot closer to the original price of the 265: The 570 is now going for $449.99.\nThe Forerunner 970 is also $100 off, which brings its current price to $649.99. The biggest thing the 970 has going for it over the 570 is that it can show you maps while you run. Both watches can do breadcrumb tracking (drawing a line showing where you've been), but with a fully map-enabled watch, you can see important details like where your hiking route crosses roads or turns along them. The 970 also has an LED flashlight, which is incredibly handy for getting around in the dark—whether that means snuggling into your sleeping bag at a campsite or just sneaking out of your kid's room at bedtime.\nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

I love the rugged look of this smartwatch, and the battery life that can easily go for a month—thanks in part to the solar charging capabilities (though you can use a regular charger, too). It'll track all the stats you need, and packs in a host of information on its monochrome screen (including sunrise and sunset times). Lifehacker Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki named the Garmin Instinct Solar 3 \"best for hiking.\" You don't get the colors and brightness of a color display, but I think the battery life trade-off is more than worth it: It's not as if you're watching videos on your smartwatch. You can also send your phone notifications through the watch, and it even comes with a handy flashlight built right in.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Mine is owning an M4 Mac Mini home server setup, which has now become even more realistic thanks to Amazon’s Black Friday sale. The already affordable base M4 Mac Mini is discounted by $120 for Black Friday, and can now be yours (and mine) for just $479.The M4 chip in the Mac Mini is no joke. My daily driver is the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro, and I love the thing. I love the power, the screen, the whole package. But now that my wife and I have moved into a new place and we have a nice entertainment area set up, I really want a dedicated home computer there for both of us. A home computer would be a great place to attend to our weekly meditation sessions and daily browsing sessions, plus it could serve as a media server and a place for my wife to take a look at scans and plan out her cases (she is a dentist).\nBecause the Mac Mini is small and cheap, it’s the perfect candidate. We considered getting an iMac, but at the $1,299 starting price, that’s a lot to ask. Plus, we already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to go along with the Mac Mini. The 5-inch by 5-inch footprint makes it small enough that I can hide it in my TV console.The base configuration isn't quite as strong as an M4 Pro model would be, but it's more than powerful enough for our needs, and that's probably true for most home users. The M4 chip packs a 10-core CPU (with a mix of performance and efficiency cores), a 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine (NPU). There’s also 16GB RAM standard across all base Mac computers, which bodes well for longevity. And because it’s powered by an ARM chip, it’s a lot more power efficient than Intel or AMD CPUs, which means I won’t feel guilty for running it 24/7 as my media center, hosting movies on my Jellyfin server with it. The 256GB SSD is quite small, I’ll be honest, but it’s really easy to extend the storage using USB-C storage drives.If you want more power (something that matches my MacBook Pro), you can also take a look at the M4 Pro Mac Mini with 24GB RAM and 512GB storage, which is down from its usual price of $1,399 to $1,199.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

After graduating from college in 2019, I had an amazing job offer fall through because of the lockdown. I felt completely rudderless at a time when I thought I had it all figured out. Since we were all stuck inside together for months, there was no hiding my internal distress from my family.\nFortunately, my parents recognized this even more than I did. That year, they gave me a gift that pulled me out of that pit, reignited my passion for creating, and set the journey in motion that led me to my career today as a professional creator and video producer. That gift was the Cricut Explore, and this device literally changed my life.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nWhat is the Cricut Explore?For those of you who don’t know, Cricut Explore machines let you design and cut tons of materials like vinyl, cardstock, iron-on, and even leather into custom patterns that you can use for shirts, hats, or any other DIY projects that you might have in mind. Able to work with over 100 materials, the Cricut Explore line allows you to create almost anything you want on demand in a user-friendly, inexpensive way. The cost-effective aspect was huge for me, as I had almost zero money to my name and all the time in the world to learn. Since the Cricut Explore works via Bluetooth or USB, I was able to create custom items on request for people, featuring specialized materials and designs that would normally take weeks or months to complete. The Cricut took on a pivotal role in my creative process. It led to the creation of XtarBoy Apparel, my custom apparel company, which would eventually support me throughout the entire pandemic. I made custom shirts for yoga studios, limited-run apparel and merch for micro-influencers, and even inked my first sponsorship deal for a motorsport racing team in San Diego.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Cricut also introduced me to an important business mentor in my life. As I was trying to get XtarBoy off the ground, I had quietly taken on a job at a local auto-tinting place in San Diego, and the owner took a liking to what I was working on. He would request custom shop merch and team gear, and was one of the biggest supporters of my side project when I had almost zero faith in myself. He even set aside a corner of the shop for the Cricut, so I could print things for customers whenever I had one, and let me use the shop as a storefront for all my designs. Later, the gifting came full circle when my mom released her first book series, as I was able to help her with promotion and marketing by making custom merch to pair with the book.Gifts can have lasting valueSometimes we take the gifts we receive for granted. There can be an expectation that they should be the newest device, the latest collab, or the most expensive item in order to be considered a “good gift.” But for me, the greatest gift I got wasn’t just the Cricut itself, but the opportunities and experiences it opened up for me to create, take risks, and challenge myself in a new and exciting way. And at the core, that’s what a holiday with heart truly represents.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In the 10 years I've owned my current car, I've never used the cigarette lighter port. The car came with a single USB-A port, so I've happily just used that to charge my phone instead. About a year ago, though, I got rid of all my USB-A cables, so now I don't have a way to charge my phone when I'm in my car. That's why I've been looking at finally putting that cigarette lighter port to good use, which is when I came across this excellent Black Friday deal on a Ugreen 130W car charger, which is currently going at 44% off.\nI've owned and used a multi-port wall adapter by Ugreen for a couple of years, and it's been working great in my house. The brand has earned my trust, and the car charger listed here also has great reviews on Amazon. It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A, and it supports up to 100W of output on one of those USB-C ports. That's good enough to charge laptops, iPads, and of course, your phones. In case you're wondering about the charger's other two ports, the USB-A port supports 22.5W output and the second USB-C port supports up to 30W.This charger also gives you the option to let multiple people charge their devices quickly when needed. Ugreen has bundled a 3.3-ft USB-C charging cable in the box, which makes it easy for rear seat passengers to charge their devices, too. When you plug it in, the charger's blue LED ring lights up, which also makes it easy to locate the ports at night. The charger has cooling vents on the back to help improve heat dissipation, too. It's a good product at a great price, which is why I'm about to click that buy button.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

At 50%, this upgraded version of the Blink Mini 2 provides strong value for anyone looking to level up their home security without breaking the bank.\nCompared to the popular Blink Mini 2, this indoor and outdoor plug-in camera offers significantly sharper 2K resolution (2560×1440) instead of the previous 1080p. This translates to better details when it comes to capturing license plates and identifying faces. It also has improved night vision, has the added support of a built-in spotlight, and supports up to 4x zoom, which further improves clarity.The 2K+ features enhanced audio and noise-cancelling two-way talk, which is helpful for those who want to communicate with visitors (or potential intruders) via the camera, or for anyone who just wants clearer sound from the monitored area. By adding a $4-per-month subscription, you unlock more smart features, such as person and vehicle detection. If you plan to use the camera outdoors (and don’t mind shelling out an extra $10), you can get a weather-resistant adapter that allows you to do so.If you’re looking for an under-$30 camera that performs well with no hard-wiring required, the Blink Mini 2K+ is a solid option, and a 50% discount makes it even more attractive. Compared to the no-frills Blink Mini 2, the 2K+ offers a big step up in performance, including better clarity, sharper video, and more detail (especially at night), making it a more future-proof choice, especially when combined with add-ons like the subscription and weather-resistant adaptor.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Does Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

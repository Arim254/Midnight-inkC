To me, it sounded like the beginning of the end for physical wallets. In reality, it was anything but: Not only are the applications limited, but even after all this time, only 12 states and Puerto Rico actually support the feature. While the rest of us wait for our respective states to get on board, many might have another option for these virtual documents. On Wednesday, Apple announced \"Digital ID,\" a new initiative that lets you create an ID in the Wallet app using your passport. This bypasses the waiting period for the 38 states that don't yet support these ID features: If you have a passport, you can try this feature out today. Even if your state supports driver's license and state ID uploads to the Wallet app, you'll miss out on features if you don't have a REAL ID. If you have a passport, however, you can use it instead, which opens up the wallet ID feature to even more users than before. Like previous attempts at virtual IDs, however, don't expect to be able to use this Digital ID just anywhere you'd normally show documentation. Right now, the main use for Digital ID is for flying: According to Apple, Digital ID is launching in beta at over 250 airports to be used at TSA checkpoints. Importantly, this feature only supports domestic flights, even though it uses your passport. As such, do not rely on your Digital ID when flying outside of the U.S. You'll still need your physical passport in order to validate your identity. In the future, however, Apple says you'll be able to use this Digital ID for other purposes, such as booking flights and hotels, as well as opening new accounts.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow to add your passport to your iPhoneTo start, you'll need a valid U.S. passport, an iPhone 11 or later with iOS 26.1 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 6 or later with WatchOS 26.1. First, open the Wallet app on your iPhone, then tap the (+) at the top of the screen. Here, tap \"Digital ID\" under \"United States.\" Here, you'll see a pop-up which informs you about Digital ID. Tap \"Continue,\" then follow the on-screen instructions to scan different parts of your passport using your iPhone's camera. You'll next need to authenticate yourself by taking a Live Photo of your face. Once confirmed, you'll need to capture more angles of your face and head, which the Wallet app directs you through. Once validated, the ID will live in your Wallet app. You can open the Wallet app, or double-click the Side or Home button, then choose the ID whenever you need to present it. When in line at the TSA, for example, you can hold your iPhone with your ID activated near the reader: Once the two connect, the reader will take your photo, while your iPhone will show you all the information you'll be providing to TSA, which can include things like your legal name, date of birth, sex, nationality, ID number, ID photo, expiration date, the date the ID was added, and who verified the ID. You'll need to double-click the Side or Home button to confirm you want to share this data.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nIs Digital ID secure?Yes, at least according to Apple. The company says that any ID data you add to the Wallet app, be it a passport, driver's license, or state ID, is encrypted and stored on-device. That means that only you have access to this data—not even Apple can see it. In addition, Apple cannot see when you use your ID, nor can they see what data you shared at the time of identification. You also need to use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate yourself through this process, so even if someone steals your iPhone, they won't be able to obtain that ID data. As stated above, you will see a list of data that will be shared when authenticating with Digital ID. If you aren't comfortable sharing this data with, say, TSA, you don't have to double-click the Side or Home button, and can instead choose another form of authentication. Plus, the way this feature is set up, you don't need to unlock your iPhone or physically hand it over to confirm your iPhone. By double-clicking the Side button or Home button, you can access the ID data without compromising your iPhone. I'm pretty privacy conscious, but this is a feature I'd be willing to try—assuming I fly out of an airport that supports it. I could see how this might be a bridge too far for some people, especially considering the amount of face scanning you need to do to validate the ID. But Apple says in its Wallet app that this data is used to validate your identity and prevent fraud, and is retained only until the issuing authority approves or denies your ID. In other words, whether or not setup is successful, Apple will delete your face scans once the process is over. Seeing as the rest of the data is encrypted, that might just be enough for me to be comfortable testing this out. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

On the surface, it does about what you'd expect, making it easy to browse games and Nintendo news, and even purchase games outright (albeit through an in-app browser window, presumably to avoid funneling Apple hefty commission fees). But hidden in the tiniest, most out-of-the-way button in the app is a detailed tracker for your play activity—finally fixing a feature that Nintendo consoles have dropped the ball on since the original Switch launched way back in 2017.The Switch has its own activity tracker, but it doesn't tell you much\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nOn their own, neither the Nintendo Switch nor Nintendo Switch 2 tell you much about your play history. It's easy to see, at least—you just need to select your profile picture in the top-left corner of the home screen to see your list of recently played games. But scroll down to check out your \"Play Activity,\" and you'll quickly be disappointed. Most of my games don't show an exact playtime number, instead either simply saying I've \"Played for a little while\" or \"Played for X hours or more.\" That's not very useful—and if try to you select a game to get more info, the system will just launch it instead.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's much less handy than, say, the daily playtime reports the Wii used to show you right on the system, which told you what day you played on and for how long. Thankfully, the new Nintendo Store app brings that detailed info back, and then some.How to view your playtime on the Nintendo Store appTechnically, there was already a way to get detailed Nintendo Switch play activity through your smartphone, but it required setting up parental controls for yourself, a lengthy process that doesn't serve much of a purpose if you're an adult. Now, though, the Nintendo Store app makes it easy, and it's glorious.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nJust download and log into the Nintendo Store app with your existing Nintendo Account—the same one you used when you set up your system—and tap on your profile picture in the bottom-right corner. Scroll down to \"Play Activity,\" and you're all set: You'll see a customizable list of your games, and tapping on any one will show you not just your total playtime, but which days you played on and for how long.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nMy only complaint is that you won't have any idea of your playtime until you tap into a game, although you can sort the games list by total time played if you'd like; that will put games under categories for over 100 hours of play, over 50 hours, over 10 hours, and so on.The app even tracks playtime for the 3DS and Wii U\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe new app's coolest feature? It's not limited to Switch and Switch 2. This data goes way back, and if I scroll far enough (or sort by game system), I can also see my playtime for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U games. There is a catch—I don't seem to be able to see playtime by day for systems older than the original Switch, but I can see my total playtime, as well as how many separate days I played the game for. Again, to see your stats from these older consoles, you'll need to log in with the same Nintendo Account you used when you were playing on them—I've been using mine since the Wii U days.Back then, your Nintendo Account was known as your Nintendo Network ID. If you're a loyal Nintendo gamer, chances are good you linked your old Nintendo Network ID with your new Nintendo Account at some point in the past—but if you haven't, and you used to log in on your Wii U or 3DS with a different account, your play history isn't lost. If you scroll down to the bottom of the Play Activity screen, you should see the option to link the two accounts. Just tap that big red button and follow the prompts (if you can't remember than ancient login, the account recovery options still seem to be working, though the service was discontinued back in 2020.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Joel Cunningham / Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI'm a sucker for these kind of metrics, even if they're not fully representative of my play (I tend to bounce between my profile and my husband's profile a lot, as well as between systems). As embarrassing as it can be to see that I've spent more than 100 hours in Breath of the Wild, playtime data makes it easy for me to remember what I've played without having to keep a Letterboxd style game diary. It also encourages me to spend more time with games I might have just glanced at before or, if I'm feeling guilty after seeing a particularly big playtime number, to put down the system and spend some time outside.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Naturally, scammers are using this model to collect your personal data and promising huge rewards that never materialize. According to a report from Malwarebytes Labs, bad actors are luring users into taking surveys through malvertising ads claiming you've won a Walmart voucher for hundreds of dollars. All you have to do is answer a few questions—easy enough—but you're actually handing over information that can be used to target you even further. Surveys promising big rewards are a scamThese scams start with malvertising (malicious advertising) like website pop-ups and banners, spam emails, and social media ads stating that you've been selected to receive a \"free\" gift card worth hundreds of dollars. The fake ads use official logos from recognizable brands, which build trust, along with countdown timers, which promote urgency. You may think you've gotten lucky, and all you have to do is take a short survey to earn a big payout. When you click through, though, you're redirected to a fake rewards page, which may also look credible thanks to stolen branding. You'll be prompted to provide personal information, such as your name, phone number, email, and address, as well as indicate interest in topics like home repair and insurance. You may be redirected again based on your answers—to a spoofed home improvement site for FindMyWindowPro or Renewal By Anderson, for example—where you're prompted to provide even more data. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis endless loop of surveys doesn't end with a gift card payout, and along the way, you've handed scammers a lot of information that can be sold and used to target you with much more personalized scams in the future based on interests you've handed them. Survey scams may seem like simply a waste of time rather than a real threat, since you don't lose any money right away. But you may see more spam calls and believable phishing emails as a result. Avoid fake survey scamsLike all scams, this one plays on emotion: notably, the excitement of getting lucky and winning big. You're lured in with a sense of urgency and the illusion of low effort. Scammers also use real branding to make the scheme seem more credible. As always, these elements should raise suspicion. Retailers are almost never offering promotions that are too good to be true, and you should never provide personal information in exchange for a \"free\" prize. If you do click through one of these ads, look carefully at the URL, which is almost certainly not the retailer's official domain. How to actually get paid for taking surveysYou can get paid to take surveys or test apps and games, though you certainly won't earn the hundreds of dollars promised in survey scams. The pay is low for the time invested (in most cases, a few dollars per hour) and some survey platforms require you to hit a minimum amount earned to request a payout. You typically have to engage consistently and across multiple platforms to make it worthwhile. NerdWallet compiled a list of popular survey-for-money apps, including Make Money, Eureka, InboxDollars Surveys, Google Opinion Rewards, and Swagbucks. Reddit users also suggest Survey Junkie and Branded Surveys. Prolific is a relatively high-paying platform, though you have to join a waitlist to gain access. Of course, you should know that even legitimate survey sites collect a lot of personal information, such as your birth date, zip code, phone number, and health history. All of this may be sold to data brokers, and there's always a risk of a data breach that could lead to identity theft. Be sure to weigh the risks and rewards of signing up for these platforms. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Yes, as part of the November 2025 Pixel feature drop, Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones (excluding the Pixel 9a) are getting AI notification summaries.The problem with AI notification summariesIf you're reeling back after reading that, I don't blame you. This is one of the few AI features Apple beat Google to the punch on, and when they came out during the iOS 18.3 beta, the summaries were quickly criticized for handling hard topics like breakups with a cold tone, as well as for misreporting the news.Apple quickly pulled news summaries (although they've since come back) and made it clearer when an AI was writing a notification, but it seems Google's still being a bit more cautious with its launch.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow AI Notification Summaries on Pixel work\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nRather than trying to organize every notification you might get, Google's AI Summaries are just starting off with popular chat apps for now, including its own Messages app and alternatives like WhatsApp. Additionally, they'll only kick in on \"longer chats,\" with the idea being to give you, \"digestible conversation recaps.\" That means you're going to see far fewer AI notifications than on the iPhone, which currently uses them for news, entertainment, chats, email, and more. That's probably a safer approach for Google, but it does mean the AI summaries are meant to be used more to get you quickly back up to speed, rather than for organization (although that will change in the future).As on the iPhone, AI notification summaries on the Pixel will be indicated by a small icon with a sparkle and a few lines below it, with the summary following. They'll also be italicized for additional visual distinction.How to turn on AI Notification Summaries on PixelGoogle is also exercising caution by making its AI notification summaries entirely opt-in. That means you'll need to manually turn them on before you start seeing them, which you can do under Settings > Notifications > Notification Summaries. While on this page, you'll also be able to exclude certain apps from sending AI notification summaries, by adding them to the \"Don't include these apps\" list.If you're still not seeing the summaries after enabling them, ensure your Android System Intelligence is enabled under Settings > Notifications > Privacy > Notification read, reply & control. Additionally, summaries will not be generated while your phone is in battery saver mode, or while you're actively using it (per Google, for them to kick in, \"the screen must be off for a moment\").When will my Pixel get AI Notification Summaries?AI Notification summaries start rolling out today, alongside the November system patch. However, they're not automatically included in the downloadable patch, so it might be a while before you see them (I don't have them yet).It's still not a bad idea to get your phone fully up-to-date in the meantime. To download the November 2025 Pixel update, either wait for a notification from Google, or head to Settings > System > Software updates to manually check if it's been rolled out to you yet.What's next for Pixel's AI Notification Summaries?While today's update is clearly just Google dipping its toes in the water, the company does have bigger plans for December, where some Pixels will also start automatically silencing \"lower-priority notifications\" and will start automatically sorting them into categories like \"News\" and \"Promotions.\" Hopefully, Google will have learned some lessons from Apple by the time those features go live.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Another important—but perhaps more overlooked—element of the productivity process is the assessment, however. Reviewing what you did is just as integral as planning how you’ll do it—in reviewing, you get a chance to plan better (and improve!) for next time, while also carving out space to appreciate what you did well—also a major motivator!What is an after-action review? An after-action review, or AAR, is a way to measure the results of your performance and improve on your processes. It was first introduced by the U.S. Army to give units feedback after they had collective training exercises. The Army has actually released a ton of literature on it, but all you need to know is that when carried out right, it’s standardized, done the same way every time, and useful for building a framework that can enhance future labor. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIf you do end up diving into that mountain of literature on the AAR, you’ll notice that it was designed for units or teams and is typically conducted by a facilitator who encourages members to discuss each part of the effort with the group. But it can be useful for individuals, too, since the process of completing an AAR is standardized and easy to follow. Build time into your schedule to conduct your own personal AAR after completing a major project, whether at work or in your personal life. You can complete it at the end of every week, or once you've finished a specific project. Either way, you'll want to keep notes of these reviews, whether in your planner or in a document you can add to a larger file about the project, like a single source of truth (SSOT). You may feel silly \"reviewing\" work you just completed, but the arguments for it—and the potential benefits—are substantial. First, if you're honest with yourself about what went wrong, you can figure out why the parts that didn't work were inefficient or ineffective, then seek solutions. In identifying what went well, you can set plans to replicate your process in the future, and find a little motivation in a job well done. An AAR (or something similar) is an integral part of many popular productivity techniques, including Getting Things Done and Agile Results. All the planning in the world doesn't matter if you never reflect on how it all went so you can improve next time around. What you should put into your after-action reviewThis is where we get into the rigid, structured process of the Army. There are four questions you’ll ask yourself when conducting your AAR and they’ll always be the same: What did I intend to accomplish?What did I do?Why did it happen the way it did?What will I do to change my strategy or execution for a better outcome next time OR how can I duplicate my success?Essentially, consider what you wanted to get done, what you actually got done, what impacted the outcome, and what you can take away for future attempts. Even running over this checklist in your head is a good practice, but writing it down is best, so you can refer back to it next time you’re in the planning stages on a new project. For instance, say you want to clean your kitchen. That’s the answer to the first question. What you really did, whether it was clean the kitchen, avoid the task, or only give it a half-effort, is the answer to the second. The third question is where you get introspective: If you did clean the kitchen, was it because you had company coming over and felt a sense of urgency, aligning your productivity with the Yerkes-Dodson Law? Or maybe it was because you needed to feel a sense of accomplishment after an otherwise unproductive week, but you were so burned out that you didn't do a great job. If you didn’t clean, was it because you felt overwhelmed? Did you get too busy? Did you lack the right tools for the job? Once you’ve established your reasons, you can build them into the answer to the fourth question, writing something like, “I will clean my kitchen weekly to make sure I’m always ready for unexpected company,” “I will follow a regimented cleaning method to avoid feeling overwhelmed,” or, “I will invest in better cleaning tools to make the next attempt go smoother.” When cleaning time rolls around again, you’ll pre-plan your actions as normal, scheduling out time for the activity and setting goals.

    "body": "\n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        November 21, 2025\n    \n            Credit: Justin Pot\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Want to block ads on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad? wBlock is quickly becoming my favorite solution: it's free, open source, fast, and customizable.Ad blocking is in a weird place. Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Scammers love to impersonate government and law enforcement officials, from the FBI to the U.S. Marshals Service to Medicare and other health insurance programs. There's a good reason for this: Most Americans use government services at some point, and many may be apt to trust, or at least engage with, someone claiming to be from a well-known agency. Plus, the threat of losing benefits or being targeted by legal action is especially compelling when it comes from a government representative, and victims may be more likely to comply with scammers' demands. It's no surprise, then, that schemes currently making the rounds involve Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits, according to warnings from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Social Security numbers are often part of identity theft, so it would be alarming to receive a notice that yours has been involved in criminal activity. Scammers are counting on this when impersonating the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and trying to trick you into actually giving up your SSN and other sensitive information.  \nHere's how the scheme works: Fraudsters are sending emails with the subject line \"Alert: Social Security Account Issues Detected\" and including attachments on letterhead that looks like it comes from the OIG. The notice contains official-seeming information, such as a reference number and case ID, and states that your SSN will be suspended within 24 hours due to fraudulent activity on your account. The letter also says that criminal charges have been filed and even includes the statutes that have supposedly been violated. Recipients are instructed to call the number listed to \"respond to these allegations,\" but the person on the other end is a scammer impersonating an SSA employee. They will try to exploit your fear and confusion to collect personal and financial information from you. VA benefits overpayment scamScammers are also contacting veterans and military family members who receive VA benefits, claiming that said benefits have been overpaid and pressuring targets to pay back the money owed. According to the VA's advisory, fraudsters are using fake VA letterhead and logos on notices sent by mail and email as well as spoofing real VA phone numbers. They are trying to convince beneficiaries to make payments immediately using methods like wire transfers, cryptocurrency, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards, and they may also request sensitive information your VA login or bank account credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile VA benefits could legitimately be overpaid, the VA won't contact you and demand money—especially via bitcoin and other unrecoverable methods. Nor should you ever have to pay an upfront fee for assistance with managing VA debts and claims (the VA does this for free). If you do actually owe money, you will be able to find more information on repayment through your official VA.gov account. Always verify through official VA channels, such as VA.gov and the VA’s Debt Management Center (800-827-0648). Never rely solely on unsolicited communication, and never give out your password, SSN, or financial information. Government agencies don't send threatening notices via email (or by any other means), so if you receive a scary letter out of the blue, don't act without investigating. Always contact the agency via the information found on its website—don't call or text any number provided in these notices.   \n            ",

Opening your statement to see expensive charges you didn't make is stressful, and canceling your card—and dealing with all of your attached subscriptions—is a nightmare. So if you get a call about an unauthorized charge for a brand new iPhone, you're probably going to want to get to the bottom of it. Here's the thing: It's likely a scam. I speak from experience: My wife keeps getting calls from unknown numbers, all of which leave voicemails about charges for iPhones. The voicemail starts off with what sounds like standard holding music. Suddenly, a voice pops in, saying something to the affect of: \"This is Amazon. This call is to authorize the payment of $999 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 16 Pro on your account. If you do not authorize this payment, please press \"one\" to speak to our customer support representative.\" Your call may also be about, \"the payment of $1,099 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 17 Pro on your account.\" We are inundated with the calls, and besides the payment amount and the specific iPhone model, the rest of the message is identical. As you might expect, no such charges are actually present on either our Amazon account or in our credit card history. That's because no one bought an iPhone in our name, or by using our financial information: This was simply a scam.\nHad we answered the phone and pressed \"one\" to speak with a \"customer support representative,\" or called the number back after listening to the voicemail, this is what would have likely happened: The \"representative\" would have assured us that they would be able to dispute the charge, but of course they'd need some information from us first. Perhaps they would have needed us to confirm the credit card information, and would ask us to read our digits out loud. Maybe they'd need to make sure we actually owned the Amazon account in question, and would ask for our two-factor authentication code to \"confirm our identity.\" No matter what the case, the scammers would have been praying on our concern about the charge to extract some type of sensitive information from us, all for their own financial gain. Had we called back and complied, we would have almost assuredly handed the scammers the money we thought they were helping us get back.  What to do if you get this voicemailIf you get a voicemail like this, don't call them back. If you pick up the phone, and you get this message, don't press \"one;\" just hang up. You are definitely being scammed, and there's no risk in simply ignoring the caller completely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you'd like to verify their claims, don't involve the caller at all. Instead, head to your Amazon account, and check your order history. You'll be able to see if any such iPhones were ordered under your account—and, if they were, you can cancel the order here. Similarly, check your credit card history: If you don't see a charge for an iPhone, there wasn't one. If you do see one, reach out to the credit card company directly through their official contact information.  Scammers rely on pressure tactics that stress you out, and make you feel like time is of the essence. It rarely ever is. While it might seem common practice for companies like Amazon to call customers about large charges, it really isn't. If you ever receive unsolicited communications from someone claiming to represent a company you belong to, you can always end the conversation, and reach out directly yourself. If you contact Amazon's official customer support, or the company that issues your credit card, they'll be able to confirm or deny the claim for you.  While you can block the number, it might not do much good. Each time we've received a call, it's been from a different number, so my guess is they're not reusing numbers when calling you back. Instead, you should strongly consider using one of Apple's built-in anti-spam tools. If you're running iOS 26, you can choose to have your iPhone screen calls from unknown numbers, and ask for information before sending the call your way. No matter which version of iOS you have, you can also choose to silence unknown callers en masse, so you're never interrupted by any caller that isn't in your contacts. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There are Chromebooks with OLED screens, high refresh rates, and even light-up keyboards, but no matter how many bells and whistles you slap on a Chromebook, it's still not going to have nearly as much raw processing power as a more traditional laptop.That's where cloud gaming comes in. This lets you stream games from the cloud, if you're willing to put up with a certain amount of video compression and input delay. One of the most popular cloud gaming services is Nvidia's GeForce Now, which lets you play select free-to-play titles and PC games you already own using the company's own data centers. The catch is that you either have to watch ads or pay up—but today, Google's Chromebooks are getting an exclusive new tier of GeForce Now that fixes both of these issues.Called GeForce Now Fast Pass, this version of GeForce Now is sort of like an expanded version of the existing free tier. You'll still be limited to playing at 1080p and 60fps—higher specs will require you to pay—and you won't have access to GeForce Now's \"Install-to-Play\" games, which means the library of compatible titles will be closer to 2,000 than 4,000. But unlike the free tier, you won't have to watch any ads, and you won't have to wait in a queue to start playing. Nvidia says the typical free-tier queue is only two minutes long, but hey, the sooner you can hop into the action, the better.\nStarting today, all new Chromebook purchases will come with a free year of GeForce Now Fast Pass, but there are some caveats. The big one is that you only get 10 free Fast Pass hours per month, although up to five unused hours will roll over to the next month.That means you'll still have to keep track of your time while playing, even if you don't have to watch ads. A Google spokesperson told me over email that once your Fast Pass hours are up, you'll be downgraded to the basic, ad-supported free tier, or you can purchase more Fast Pass hours a la carte. I wasn't told exactly how much these hours will cost, but given that a day pass (meaning 24 hours of play) of GeForce Now with no ads and higher specs than Fast Pass costs just $3.99, I can't imagine they'll be too expensive.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for when your year of Fast Pass is over, I'm still waiting for an answer on how to renew. I'll update this post once I hear back. I've also asked whether users that already have Chromebooks will be able to sign up for GeForce Now Fast Pass.One last bonus for Fast Pass, though, is that you don't have to actually use it on your Chromebook. You'll need a Chromebook to sign up (I'm also still waiting on exact steps for that), but once you've redeemed the offer, you'll be able to use it on any GeForce Now compatible device, like a phone or tablet.Overall, it doesn't exactly seem like something I'd go out of my way to buy a Chromebook for, but it could be a decent way to get good enough performance to play through about one short game per month, all without having to pay for GeForce Now or deal with ads or wait times. Combine that with the free games that sites like Epic give out on a regular basis, and you could essentially game casually for a year without buying anything other than your Chromebook. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Your Mac now has a built-in clipboard manager, which means that it can finally remember everything you've copied. This feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it pretty easily and start keeping track of the text, photos, and other files that are in your clipboard. The catch is that you need to be running macOS 26 Tahoe to use the built-in clipboard manager, which isn't an option for those with older Macs. Also, Apple's implementation of the clipboard manager is pretty basic, and if you need more features, you're going to have to use third-party alternatives. With that in mind, here is how to pick the best clipboard manager for your Mac.Spotlight search: The best clipboard manager for most people\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nNot everyone needs an advanced clipboard manager. For most people, an app that does the basics is good enough, and it's even better if that app ships with your Mac. As long as your Mac is running macOS 26 Tahoe, you can use the built-in clipboard manager. I wrote about using Spotlight as your clipboard manager recently, and it's been super convenient. You need to enable it by going to System Settings > Spotlight > Results from Clipboard, but after that, you're all set. Spotlight will log everything you copy, except sensitive information such as passwords. You can then access all of your clipboard entries by pressing Command-Space (or clicking that magnifying glass in your Mac's menu bar) and then Command-4. \nThis feature is good enough to get started with clipboard management, but it doesn't sync clipboard history across devices or support features like categorizing copied items by type. If you need advanced features to speed up your workflow, you'll have to rely on third-party apps. It's also worth noting that if you use Spotlight alternatives such as Alfred or Raycast, those apps ship with clipboard managers, too. You don't have to switch back to Spotlight just for this feature.Maccy: A simple, free clipboard manager for older Macs\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you can't install macOS Tahoe on your Mac, or if you use an older Mac that isn't supported any longer, you can download Maccy to get a fast, free, and open source clipboard manager that's just as good as Apple's built-in feature. Maccy is a lightweight menu bar app that displays clipboard history when you click its icon. It also lets you quickly search through your clipboard entries and functions reliably without getting in the way of your work. Plus, you can set up a list of applications to ignore, which means that you can stop it from storing data when you copy from sensitive apps such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, among others. Download: Maccy (free via GitHub, also available for $10 on the Mac App Store, or for $5 via Gumroad).PastePal: A great paid clipboard manager\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI bought PastePal a year ago, and it has served me well ever since. This app is available as a one-time purchase at a reasonable price, and it has pretty much every feature you could ask for. In addition to basic clipboard management, it lets you automatically remove tracking URLs from links, or transform text between upper case and lower case. I also love that it lets you edit items you've copied, which makes life a lot easier when you've accidentally copied a few extra characters with your text.PastePal also supports sequential paste, which means that you can copy a bunch of items and paste them one-by-one. This is great for speeding up repetitive tasks such as copying from one window and pasting in another. My only complaint with this app is that its interface is not super intuitive. If you like your apps to be pretty, you will be disappointed here. While PastePal has all the features you need, you'll have to spend some time digging through settings to make the most of them. That's an acceptable compromise for me, but it may not be for others. You have the option of buying PastePal direct from the developer or from the Mac App Store. The App Store purchase also unlocks the app on iPhone, iPad, in addition to Mac.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDownload: PastePal ($15 via Mac App Store or a direct purchase)Paste: Pricey, but the best clipboard manager overall\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI think Paste is the best clipboard manager for Apple devices overall. It's feature-packed and has the best interface that you could ask for in this kind of an app. It reliably handles your clipboard history, lets you choose which apps to exclude from its tracking, allows you to organize and pin items, and supports advanced features such as extracting text from images and sequential pasting.It also uses a rather simple and intuitive keyboard shortcut (Command-Shift-V) to open or close the clipboard history panel. Plus, there are extra touches, such as letting you view a preview of a webpage when you've copied a link to it. This makes it easy to check if a link is working before you paste it into an app. It's an overall neat and thoughtful app that's well worth recommending.Paste is available on the Mac App Store, but its premium tier requires a subscription fee. This unlocks the app on all devices and lets you sync your clipboard history easily. I think it's a bit pricey, but if you want the best clipboard manager that money can buy, this is it.Download: Paste ($4/month or $30/year; one-time purchase fee is $90)\n            ",

Not only can you save yourself from more expensive heating bills with thoughtful weatherproofing, but you can also be more confident in the event of winter storms or simply more comfortable when you choose to stay indoors. Keeping your house warm, cozy, and safe for the winter is made easier by addressing potential problems early through simple checks and chores now. Here are all the home maintenance tasks you should do in November.1) Add vent covers to your vents and crawlspacesWhen the weather gets colder, wild animals seek a good place to shelter for the winter. If you have uncovered vents or crawl spaces, they can prove to be an inviting spot for creatures. To keep them out, see that you have vent covers in place and that crawl spaces or any other exterior nooks and crannies are sealed up or covered with a sturdy metal mesh. If you don't have vent covers installed, consider adding them. This method will help defend against squirrels, raccoons, rats, mice, birds, and bats.2) Change the batteries in your fire and carbon monoxide alarmsIf you have non-wired smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, change the batteries once a year—even before they begin making the annoying low-battery beep, if you're up for it. While you're at it, check your various hazard detection systems to ensure they work properly. Since people spend more time indoors during the colder months, there is an elevated risk of fire from the use of heaters, candles, and cooking. Additionally, keeping windows closed and sealed can increase the risk of carbon monoxide accumulation inside. Giving your detectors a once-over can help reduce your risk.\n3) Install weatherproofing to doors and windowsIf you live in an older home or have windows or doors that aren’t well-insulated, November is a good time to weatherproof problem areas. Begin by inspecting the weatherstripping around doors and windows, checking for leaks, broken, or worn stripping. If you find any gaps, use replacement weather stripping to seal them. If you have bigger leaks around windows or doors, or older windows that let in too much air, you can also use a weatherization kit to temporarily seal off leaky openings with heat-shrinking plastic wrap. This basic weatherproofing will keep you warmer and help save money on utility bills.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n4) Organize your winter weather suppliesIf you live in an area that can get a lot of snow and ice in the winter, stock up on ice melt, shovels, and roof rakes. Take a look at your snow removal tools and make sure they’re in good shape before it’s time to use them, as replacing equipment before a storm can save you a lot of headache later. It's also a good time to stash your ice scraper, snow brush, and snow chains in your car's trunk. If you live in an area with heavy snowfall and ice, consider keeping a scraper and de-icer in your garage or utility room, so you can access them if your vehicle becomes frozen over.5) Clean ovens, toasters, and other crumb-catching appliancesKitchen fires can be caused by ovens, toasters, and other cooking appliances that have crumbs and other burnt food deposits. Since people tend to stay home and use their ovens more during colder months—not to mention entertain more during the holiday season—ovens and toasters can get a more intense workout this time of year. Checking that your appliances are clean and hazard-free in November can save you from a disaster down the road, not to mention that you'll be happier with cleaner appliances and less work during spring cleaning season.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

I recently used AI to incorporate her art into physical gifts. If you want to achieve the same quality with a meaningful family photo, here's how you can utilize Adobe's new upscaling features to get the best results.\nFor this process, I used Adobe Firefly and Photoshop. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's generative AI application, and the company released a phone app this summer to help you create on the go. If you're a total newbie to Firefly, you can just ask the app for help along the way. Photoshop, which has long been the gold standard for image editing, recently added an AI upscaling feature that can improve scanned photos or images with the click of a button. Here's how I did it.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nHow I used Adobe AI features to make giftsI started by using Adobe Firefly to visualize my mom’s art on various products, including aprons, scarves, and even dresses. Seeing mockup options helped me decide on an apron as the perfect first piece.Next, I brought an image of an original painting into Photoshop and used the AI upscaling feature. Wearables require a much larger print size, and this step ensures every detail stays crisp and vibrant. I then uploaded the file to Printful, a print-on-demand platform. You can also use Printify or a different print-on-demand provider, as the process is nearly identical.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn just a few clicks, the apron was ready to print and ship directly, and it was such a pleasure to see my mom wear her own artwork. With technology and AI, we’ve been able to take her creations beyond the canvas and share them with people everywhere, making every gift feel personal, meaningful, and timeless. If you want to tinker with AI this holiday season, this is one way to get some practice and make a thoughtful gift for a loved one along the way.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In macOS 26 Tahoe, Apple's shipped a bunch of ways to customize the look and feel of your Mac's desktop, app icons, and menu bar, among other things. And there's more to it than just tweaking how Liquid Glass looks. If you're the sort of person who enjoys theming and customization, try these tips.Tweak app icons in the Dock\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYour Mac's Dock probably has a bunch of colorful icons. I've always enjoyed those diverse colors, but others might want something more uniform. If you feel like going with a particular tint, or if you just want your app icons to use dark mode, it's just a quick tweak away. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and go to System Settings > Appearance > Icon & widget style. Here, you can change the app icons to Dark, Clear, or Tinted. The Tinted option lets you select a single tint for all your app icons, so choose the color you like the most.Customize the clock in your Mac's lock screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOnce you upgrade to macOS Tahoe, you'll probably notice the new clock on your lock screen. You can tweak this to your liking, too. Just go to System Settings > Wallpaper > Clock Appearance. You can choose one of six clock styles. Don't forget to adjust the slider below the Weight option, which lets you change the font to make the clock look sleeker or more prominent.\nCustomize the Control Center\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWith iOS 18's release in 2024, Apple started letting you customize your iPhone's Control Center. This year, that feature is finally on Mac, starting with macOS Tahoe. To use it, just click the Control Center button in the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen, and select Edit Controls. There are plenty of controls to choose from, so take your time and add what you need. You can drag-and-drop any of the controls to move them around, or you can click the - (minus) button next to any control to remove it from the Control Center. Alternatively, you can tweak your control center under System Settings > Menu Bar > Menu Bar Controls.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOne of the more controversial changes to macOS Tahoe is the swap to a transparent menu bar. The clear color sometimes makes it harder to read text, but if you don't like that, you can restore a background to your menu bar. This feature is under System Settings > Menu Bar > Show menu bar background.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChange folder icon colors on Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're tired of the default blue color for folder icons, macOS Tahoe lets you tweak this to suit your style. Go to System Settings > Appearance > Folder color and use the drop-down menu to change the color of folder icons. I'd have never thought of myself as a person who uses orange folder icons, but I suppose we all go through a tangerine season at some point in our lives.Switch Mac theme in Settings\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nmacOS Tahoe also gives you limited control over your Mac's theme. If you go to System Settings > Appearance > Theme and pick a color, you'll notice that this color also applies to the cursor in writing apps, and the color of selected items in menus, too. On the same menu page, you can also choose a different color for highlighted text, which is a nice additional level of customization. It ensures that if I pick a particularly bright color for my overall theme, I can still choose a milder color for text selection. That helps me stay focused while I'm working, which is something I value a lot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        At this late stage in the streaming era, we're all overwhelmed by more digital subscriptions than we can keep track of, from fitness apps to cloud storage. Still, it certainly feels as though Netflix is one of the subscriptions that people are least likely to ditch—and that's backed up by the numbers.Perhaps it's because Netflix was the first company to really make streaming work, or perhaps it's the vast catalog of content it's amassed, or perhaps it's just because of Stranger Things and Squid Game. Whatever the reason, Netflix's churn rate is impressively low. Subscribers stick with it.Certainly it's always something I've long considered a mainstay on my streaming device. But recently, in the midst of reevaluating all of my monthly subs, I decided to save myself some money and actually cancel Netflix. It has gone so well, I'd suggest you do the same.\nHere's what I've noticed since my life became Netflix-free—and I have a strong suspicion this might be your experience too. (Full disclosure: I will eventually subscribe again, if only to finish Stranger Things, but there are benefits to quitting, even if only temporarily.)I didn't miss it as much as I thought I would\n    \n            \n            Netflix content: There's a lot of it.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI was quite a heavy Netflix user before I gave it up, and would often cycle through the recommended list of shows and movies in the evening and especially on weekends. I've recently binged my way through shows like The Diplomat, Dept Q., Departure, and The Glass Dome. I could always find something to watch on Netflix.But when I stopped being able to access Netflix, I realized didn't really miss it all that much. My viewing switched to other streaming services, and free, ad-supported channels in particular. There's actually more free content out there than you might have realized. I even did some fun rewatches of movies and shows I'd previously purchased on various platforms (because I don't always want to rent something for the evening).I've also been spending less time streaming video in general—more of my time has been put towards gaming and reading since I ditched my Netflix subscription. I've even been to an actual movie theater once or twice (not that you can see anything developed by Netflix on the big screen for the most part). The prices keep going up\n    \n            \n            Need an extra member? That's an extra cost.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nBefore I quit Netflix, I was on the most expensive plan: It's £18.99 a month here in the U.K., and $24.99 a month in the U.S. This gets you the best audio and 4K HDR video quality, spatial audio, four simultaneous streams, and six devices for downloading content. It's actually one of the most expensive streaming packages there is, and prices keep going up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAfter the great password crackdown of 2023, you can't even share the account with anyone who doesn't live with you either—at least not unless you pay an extra fee (£4.99 here in the UK, $8.99 in the US). By any measure, that's a significant chunk of money. If you're paying for the best plan plus an extra member and decide to take six months off Netflix, you'll saving yourself more than $200.There are cheaper plans available of course, if you want to sit through ads and put up with lower-resolution video—but I thought the whole point of paying for streaming was to avoid ads? It's hard to imagine Netflix ever dropping its prices, so this is a problem that's likely to get worse over time.Your account will be preserved for two years\n    \n            \n            Netflix will hang on to all your viewing history for a while.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne of the reasons you might be reluctant to cancel Netflix is because you think you'll lose years' worth of your viewing history and your personalized recommendations, and have to start again with a blank slate if you decide to sign back up. But in fact, Netflix stores your account information for 24 months—including ratings, game saves, and other account details.As long as you resubscribe again within a couple of years, you'll find everything as you left it (though you may need to scan some plot recaps for shows you were halfway through binge watching). This suggests Netflix is keen to leave the option to resubscribe open as long as possible. In my experience, it'll definitely send you lots of emails about rejoining in the meantime.I'm going to go back to Netflix someday—there's just too much stuff on there that I want to watch—but after years and years as a customer, it's been an interesting experiment to see what life is like without it. Certainly after this, I wouldn't be worried about taking another Netflix break in the future. When I decide I want to resubscribe, it'll only take a couple of clicks or taps.\n            ",

It's always at hand, can capture photos, videos, and voice notes as well as text, and is able to log locations, trips and more. Its new AI tools can even draft a few entries automatically for you.What's more, your phone probably now comes with a journal app preinstalled: Apple's Journal app launched in 2023, and a brand new Journal app from Google, initially exclusive to the Pixel 10, is now available on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 too (apparently because these phones also have Gemini Nano on board). Plus, a wide selection of third-party options is available on the Android and iOS app stores.In recent days, in an attempt to determine whether or not journaling on my phone might be for me, I've tested out both the Apple and Google offerings, as well as some of the best third-party alternatives. Here's what I found, and which apps I'd recommend if you want to log your thoughts and feelings on your phone.\nThe built-in optionsJournal by AppleLet's start with Journal by Apple, launched in December 2023. It's fair to say there haven't been a ton of updates released for the app since then, but all of the essentials are covered: Your journal entries can combine text, photos, videos, audio, locations, and sketches, and you can even set up multiple journals for different purposes.I do like the way this app makes suggestions for journaling, particularly in terms of recent locations and photos—it means it's easier to get started or to jump back in after a while. There are also a good number of options for what you can attach to your journal entries, and I can see myself using the mood slider a lot.\n    \n            \n            Journaling with Apple.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJournal by GoogleAs for the Journal app that Google recently launched for Android, it is limited to those with a phone from the Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 series. It's also pretty bare bones: I was able to log text, photos, videos, and places, as well as fitness data collected through Health Connect, but there's nothing here for audio or moods.In addition, the interface is rather plain—much more spartan than the Apple equivalent. You do get a neat overview of all your posts, but it's not particularly inspiring, and you can't configure multiple journals. In addition, the AI-powered prompts for what to write about remain exclusive to Pixel 10 handsets, so you have to do without these on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9.\n    \n            \n            Google's Journal app sticks to the basics.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNeither of these are bad apps; each will do the job of getting down your thoughts in a digital format, with some useful extras attached. The biggest benefits are they're both well integrated into their respective operating systems, and you don't need new accounts to use them. Apple's journal app is certainly better than Google's at the moment, though it's had a two-year head start.If you just want something quick and simple that's made by the company that made your phone (and that may well come preinstalled on your phone), then they're fine. However, these two journal apps remain rather bare bones compared to the other options, as well as keeping you locked in on either Android or iOS. That's why, if you're serious about your journaling, I think it's worth exploring a third-party app installed.The best third-party journal appsDay One\n    \n            \n            Day One was one of the first mobile journals to appear.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOutside of Google and Apple, Day One (Android and iOS) has long been one of the best journaling apps around—and you can take it with you if you ever jump between the Apple and Google platforms. It's been around since 2011 and is stacked with features, including multiple view types, prompts, tags, summaries, recaps, and a gorgeous design that looks great on every device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYour entries can include all the usual features, plus weather details, playlists, health data, social media posts, and more. You get a lot for free, but there is also a premium plan available for $50 a year. It gives you support for unlimited images, videos, and audio, plus extras like the ability to create journal entries over email.5 Minute Journal\n    \n            \n            5 Minute Journal focuses on positivity.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAs someone just dipping a toe into the world of journaling, 5 Minute Journal (Android and iOS) appeals right from the name. The idea is you don't have to spend too long jotting down your thoughts and ideas each day, and the app is geared towards getting you to record the more positive aspects of your life, boosting mindfulness and well-being.I like the writing prompts and journaling reminders this app provides to keep you motivated, as well as the really simple way you can log your mood as you go. It's also a beautifully designed and organized app—a completely different aesthetic experience than a more utilitarian option like Google Journal. However, some features (including unlimited photos and videos) requires a premium subscription, which starts at $5 a month.Rosebud Journal\n    \n            \n            Rosebud comes with a few AI prompt extras.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne more recommendation from my own experience: Rosebud (Android and iOS). It's branded as \"AI-powered\" but thankfully you don't have to worry too much about that, and it does a really nice job of summarizing and tracking your thoughts over time, as well as encouraging you to jot stuff down in the here and now.The app does quite a bit of hand-holding and prompting, but that's perfect if you're just getting started or struggling to journal each day, and you can always just  jot down standard journal entries with text and images if you prefer. As you might have guessed given the other options on my list, there is a pro-level subscription for $13 a month that gives you a lot more insights in terms of past entries, trends, and emotional patterns and triggers, if an AI's summary of your life is interesting to you.The best journal app is the one you useOne of the benefits of there being so many journal apps out there is that there really is something for everyone, so there's no harm in testing out Google and Apple's offerings first—they are, after all, completely free. But for journaling apps that really invest in user design and features, there are much better options out there. Now I just need to pick the one I'm going to stick with, because in the end, the best journal app is the one that you use consistently. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Now, they've initiated proceedings against four more companies—the makers of the Samsung Galaxy Ring, Reebok Smart Ring, Amazfit Helio Ring, and the Luna Ring. Oura announced on their website that they have filed an ITC complaint against those four companies. The ITC is the U.S. International Trade Commission, and Oura says its complaint is \"for the unlawful importation and sale of products that infringe on several of Oura’s patents.\"Oura's previous win against Ultrahuman and RingConn resulted in a judgment that those companies had to stop selling and importing their smart rings. RingConn ultimately came to an agreement with Oura to license their patents and continue selling their rings. Circular and Omate have made similar agreements with Oura.\nUltrahuman no longer sells their ring in the U.S., but is working on a new ring design that would sidestep the alleged patent infringement. You can read Ultrahuman's take on the situation in this blog post, which also includes a promise to continue supporting rings that they have already sold or that people may buy from resellers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe rings in the recent complaint should still be available for a while. Oura says on their blog: \"So what’s next? The ITC process will run its course.\" There's no guarantee that Oura will win their case, although the fact they were able to get such a sweeping judgment against other companies suggests that it's not too much of a long shot. While Oura's communications around this issue use phrases like \"respect for IP\" (that is, intellectual property), as a consumer and a reviewer, I hate to see an exciting tech area get dominated by a single player or, worse, shut down by that player piece by piece. I'm working on a review of the Luna ring, which I've previously noted has some serious potential improvements over other rings on the market. Here's hoping the smart ring category remains a lively one going forward.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Now, the shoe that lasted so long for me—the Nike Downshifter—is on sale for $50 or less, depending on the color.\nWhy I love these shoesYou can read the full saga of my 1,000 mile shoes here. Briefly, I wore a pair of Nike Downshifter 12s for nearly every road run I did for about a year, putting 1,024 miles on the shoes by the time I wrote about them. (I've worn them a few times since then, as well.) Since these are a budget shoe to begin with, the value was incredible—6.5 cents per mile, according to my calculations. The current model is the Downshifter 13, which I also own, although I've only put a few dozen miles on mine so far. But they seem to be a very similar type of shoe, and I won't be surprised if they make it into the quadruple digits as well. The Downshifter 13 is the one that's on sale right now.How to get the best price on Nike DownshiftersBoth the men's and women's version of the Downshifter 13 are on sale at Nike's website. (While you can find them at other retailers as well, I like to buy direct from Nike if I can find a good price, because of their excellent return policy.)The regular price is $80 for each version, and the sale price varies by color. I'm seeing prices from $48.97 to $68.97. But there's an additional discount—Nike is also offering a code, BFRIDAY, that gives you 25% off. I threw one of those cheaper pairs into my cart, applied the code, and the price dropped to $36.73. There's an $8 shipping charge, but that means the total is just $44.73. That's less than 45 bucks, shipped, for a pair of shoes that with luck might last a thousand miles. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot.

In the 10 years I've owned my current car, I've never used the cigarette lighter port. The car came with a single USB-A port, so I've happily just used that to charge my phone instead. About a year ago, though, I got rid of all my USB-A cables, so now I don't have a way to charge my phone when I'm in my car. That's why I've been looking at finally putting that cigarette lighter port to good use, which is when I came across this excellent Black Friday deal on a Ugreen 130W car charger, which is currently going at 44% off.\nI've owned and used a multi-port wall adapter by Ugreen for a couple of years, and it's been working great in my house. The brand has earned my trust, and the car charger listed here also has great reviews on Amazon. It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A, and it supports up to 100W of output on one of those USB-C ports. That's good enough to charge laptops, iPads, and of course, your phones. In case you're wondering about the charger's other two ports, the USB-A port supports 22.5W output and the second USB-C port supports up to 30W.This charger also gives you the option to let multiple people charge their devices quickly when needed. Ugreen has bundled a 3.3-ft USB-C charging cable in the box, which makes it easy for rear seat passengers to charge their devices, too. When you plug it in, the charger's blue LED ring lights up, which also makes it easy to locate the ports at night. The charger has cooling vents on the back to help improve heat dissipation, too. It's a good product at a great price, which is why I'm about to click that buy button.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

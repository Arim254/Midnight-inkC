Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n    \n            \n            There's a new Create music button in Gemini.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.When you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\n    \n            \n            You can get some help with your prompting if you need it.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n    \n            \n            You also get cover art with your artificial tunes.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them. The updated Lyria 3 model is also coming to the Dream Track music maker for YouTube Shorts creators. Lyria 3 is now rolling out inside Gemini, and is available to users aged 18 and above in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese. It's available first on the web app, and will show up on the mobile app over the next few days. Expansions in \"quality and coverage\" are planned in the future, Google says.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.   When and what time is Google I/O 2026?Google tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions. But if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years. \nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel. What will be announced at Google I/O 2026?The short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O. Like the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about. I/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware.

Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026. What the Google Chrome patch fixesThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data. CVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system. \nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat Chrome users need to doGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on. Chrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window.

The goal was to extend the lifespan of the battery, by limiting how often you fully charge it up. Batteries age with each full charging cycle, so by preventing your battery from charging to 100% every time you keep it plugged in, you can slow down that aging process, which means your device will last longer in between charges.  Now, that same feature is coming to your Mac. Apple is currently testing the feature as part of macOS 26.4, which means you'll soon be able to ask macOS to stop charging your laptop once the battery level hits a specific charge level. This feature is great for anyone that keeps their MacBook plugged in all the time while working: It'll allow you to ask your MacBook to stop charging when the battery is at 80%, or at any charge level up to 100%.Battery optimization is nothing new for macOS\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTo be clear, your MacBook ships with a battery optimization feature already, which is enabled by default. This feature automatically slows down your MacBook's charging speed once the charge level reaches 80%. Based on your past usage habits, macOS waits to continue charging your MacBook until it thinks you'll need to use the laptop again. So, if you plug in your MacBook at night, and you typically take it off the charger at 8 a.m., it might keep your MacBook at 80% until 7 a.m., then charge the extra 20% over the following hour.  \nYou can check if it's enabled by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen, and going to System Settings > Battery. Click the i button next to Battery Health and you'll see that Optimized Battery Charging is enabled.But this is all automated, based on how you use your MacBook. What makes this new charging feature different is that you set the charge limit manually. That way, if you work with your MacBook plugged in all day, it doesn't need to charge to 100% whenever it thinks it should. Instead, you can keep it at any charge limit between 80% and 100%. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to enable charge limit on your MacBookThis new feature is available with macOS 26.4, which is currently available in the Developer Beta channel for Mac updates. I strongly recommend against installing this on your primary MacBook, as issues with the beta could mean losing data or bricking your laptop. Unless Apple decides to pull the feature, it should ship to everyone with the general release of macOS 26.4. If you have a spare MacBook where you've installed macOS 26.4 beta, you can go to System Settings > Battery, where you'll see the \"Charge Limit\" feature listed under Battery Health. Here, you can manually limit the maximum charging level between 80% and 100%.Third-party battery management apps are betterWhile Apple's methods to reduce battery aging are good enough for most people, you can do a lot more with third-party battery management apps. Those apps will allow you to do more than just set a charge limit. For instance, you can start charging the Mac when the battery hits 50% and stop charging when it's at 80%, or stop charging if the battery is too hot.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you have the same experience, I have good news: I've found a workaround that offers a massive improvement to Apple's built-in search function. The problem with searching in MessagesFor most people, the easiest way to search for texts on an iPhone involves opening the Messages app, tapping the search bar near the base of the screen, and typing in what you're looking for. You'll receive a variety of results, but that's the problem: It's too much information. When I search for a person's name, for example, Messages in iOS 26 shows a list of four chats where the name is mentioned, followed by two chat threads, pinned chats, shared notes, links, photos, locations, and documents. This is great when I want a more in-depth search, but when I'm just looking for a specific message, these extra details just get in the way.  \nThe fastest way to search for texts in iOS 26That's where our hack comes in. First, open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone, then install the Search and Open Messages shortcut. This shortcuts takes advantage of actions released in iOS 26, which allow you to look for text messages and open them in a single tap. Once the shortcut is installed, you can run it from the Shortcuts app, or add it to your iPhone's Home Screen for easier access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe shortcut will prompt you to type what you want to search for, and almost instantly, it'll list all the chats containing those words. In some cases, it even highlights the exact sentence containing those words. It'll find keywords in images you share, as well: These appears as \"blank\" entries in the search results, but if you tap through, you'll see the image the search identified. The moment you tap a result, the shortcut instantly takes you to the relevant part of the chat, and doesn't make you scroll through hundreds of results to find the right one. This is the kind of functionality Apple needs to add directly to Messages. But, for now, this shortcut workaround will have to do.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can also disable push notifications for these conversations to reduce how often you're alerted for messages you don't need to see. Note that this feature works only on iOS, so if you have Messages synced on your Mac, you'll see everything and receive notifications for all messages unless you mute specific conversations. How to reduce clutter in Messages on iOSTo send messages from numbers you don't know to a separate folder, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and toggle on Screen Unknown Senders. You can also get here through the Messages app on your iPhone by tapping the three horizontal menu lines in the top-right corner and selecting Manage Filtering. Enabling Screen Unknown Senders will hide notifications and move messages to your Unknown Senders list. If you want to allow (or disallow) certain types of notifications, tap Allow Notifications and toggle categories on or off: \nTime Sensitive includes alerts, verification codes, and urgent requests. Personal includes messages identified as not sent by a business or organization. Transactions include order updates, receipts, and confirmations. Promotions include general offers and updates sent to multiple recipients. Most users will want to enable time-sensitive notifications to receive messages that include time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) and other urgent alerts. You may also want to allow personal notifications so you don't miss messages directed to you individually from real people who aren't saved in your contacts.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen you allow notifications, texts identified in those categories will appear in your Messages list for only 12 hours before being moved to Unknown Senders—a behavior that keeps your primary inbox streamlined. If you want to make an unknown sender a known sender to prevent future messages from being filtered out, open the conversation and tap Mark as Known at the bottom or add the number to your contacts. A known sender is anyone you've added to your Contacts, sent a message to, or marked as known in the conversation. Finally, if you enable Filter Spam under the same menu in your device settings, Apple will send messages identified as spam to a separate Spam list and hide notifications. You can view these and conversations from unknown senders at any time via Messages > Menu. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.In the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time. But that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility. The researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own). The participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios. How a chatbot with “correct” information can lead people astrayAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information. Even if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.  The researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:The users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that. The bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).Responses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room. People varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.Correct answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options. Overall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChatbots are a risk for doctors, tooPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care. ECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”ECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”Even in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns. Clearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results. \n            \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Beth Skwarecki\n                                    Senior Health Editor\n                                \n                                            Covering health, fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Beth's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Beth\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

The feature, called “Name Tag” within Meta, would allow users to identify people and get information about them through Meta's AI. The feature could be rolling out as early as this year. Adding the feature is not a done deal, however. According to an internal document cited by The Times, the company is weighing the “safety and privacy risks\" of introducing facial recognition as well as discussing how to navigate the response to a no-doubt controversial feature. A document quoted by The Times suggests Meta is deliberately timing a potential rollout to minimize scrutiny. “We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document from Meta’s Reality Labs reads. \nMeta's long history with facial recognitionThis would not be the first time Meta dabbled in facial recognition. Meta debated adding facial recognition to the first generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but decided against it due to privacy concerns. And Facebook, Meta's social media platform, identified and tagged people as early as 2010, but the company pulled the feature in 2021, citing \"many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society.”Concerns also include the risk of doxxing. The ACLU characterized facial recognition used by law enforcement as a \"systematic invasion of privacy,\" though personal use of the technology raises different issues. Facial recognition glasses could enable instant doxxing, linking anyone's face to publicly available information, including social media profiles, addresses, and phone numbers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMeta says it isn't planning to release a universal facial recognition tool. The company is considering glasses that identify only people a user knows based on their connection on a Meta platform, or only identify people who have a public account on a Meta site like Instagram. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature—and some products already exist in the market—we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Meta said in a statement. The upside of smart glasses with facial recognition technologyPrivacy concerns aside, the technology has genuinely beneficial applications, particularly to people with vision problems. According to The Times' report, Meta originally planned to introduce Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the blind before releasing it to the public, highlighting a group that could potentially benefit from facial recognition technology, though that plan was scrapped for unknown reasons. Mike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes, an accessibility technology company that works closely with Meta, said he has been in discussions with Meta about facial recognition glasses for more than a year. “It is so important and powerful for this group of humans,” Buckley told The Times.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.AI assistants are coming to CarPlay in iOS 26.4As spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.According to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant. \nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstall the iOS 26.4 at your own riskThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

There’s something about unpleasant bodily experiences that makes us think they must be good for us, somehow, and so the sauna has gained a healthful reputation that it doesn’t entirely deserve. Here’s a rundown of what a sauna can and can’t do for you.Saunas don’t burn fatIt is technically true that you can lose weight by sitting in a sauna, but that’s not because your body is torching fat; it’s because you’re sweating, and sweat is made of water, and water weighs something. As soon as you rehydrate—which you should—the scale will go right back to where it was at the beginning. After all, as I've discussed in the context of exercise, sweating doesn’t mean that you got a good workout or that you burned calories. It just means you were hot. People who sell saunas and sauna services like to talk up their calorie-burning benefits, but there’s no evidence to suggest you burn significantly more calories sitting in a hot room than you would sitting on your couch at home. Some more skeptical websites cite a modest figure of 1.5 to 2 times as many calories as you would burn sitting at room temperature, but without a citation. If true, that’s about the same as the difference between sitting and standing—so you can skip that trip to the sauna and just spend half an hour standing around. So why does your fitness tracker say you burned a ton of calories in the sauna? First of all, don't bring your phone in the sauna, it's bad for the battery. But since you did anyway, I'll explain. The calorie-burning algorithms on your watch are built to estimate your calorie burn from your heart rate under the assumption that you are exercising. If your heart rate increases but you are not exercising, the calculations aren't correct. The calorie burn during exercise comes from the fact that muscles all over your body are contracting over and over again. That is simply not what's happening when you sit in the sauna. Saunas don’t “detox” youIt’s 2026 and we as a society should be over this “detox” concept, which has been debunked time and time again. Ordinary inconveniences like being tired sometimes aren’t due to some secret toxins that are constantly poisoning you, and even if you do have health issues due to toxins, you should seek medical treatment and not expect smoothies or saunas to cure you.Saunas don’t replace exerciseSaunas and exercise both heat up your body and make you sweat, but there aren’t many similarities aside from that. Remember, exercise makes us stronger and improves our cardiovascular endurance (giving us a higher VO2max, for example). Sweating in a hot room doesn’t do that. Even this rundown from an exercise science researcher, whose headline draws parallels between running and sitting in a sauna, includes the following disclaimer: \"Before you contemplate cancelling your gym membership and investing the savings in a Jacuzzi, know that regular saunas or baths are unable to replicate all the health benefits of exercise training, such as promoting fat loss and increasing muscle mass. Using hot baths or saunas shouldn’t be considered as a substitute for exercise.\"Saunas may be good for your blood vesselsWhat that researcher does point out, after the disclaimer, is that there are a few lesser-known benefits of exercise that seem to be related to the increase in body heat and heart rate, rather than from the more obvious strain on our lungs or muscles. When your body temperature rises, blood vessels near the surface of your skin dilate (get wider) and this process may help cell growth and repair. In other words, simply raising body temperature may be good for your blood vessels. That's not something we normally think about, but healthy blood vessels are a part of a healthy cardiovascular system. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRelaxation is realIf you find saunas relaxing—and many of us do—that can be a health benefit in itself. Now, this isn’t as concrete a benefit as it’s sometimes made out to be. You’re not going to cure your depression or reverse your heart disease just by relaxing in a sauna every now and then. But if you enjoy your sauna sessions, they could certainly contribute to lowering your stress levels and improving your mental health. Pro tip: If you don't have access to a sauna, a hot bath may have a lot of these effects as well.Heat has its pros and consFor other medical conditions and athletic uses, the pros and cons of a sauna come down to the pros and cons of heat itself. If you have sore muscles, heat often feels good, so athletes often enjoy sauna sessions. Some skin conditions respond well to the dry air of a sauna, while others can be exacerbated by dry air but could feel better with the humid air of a steam room. Use common sense and check with your medical provider if you want to use a sauna to manage a health condition. Saunas have risks, tooIf we’re talking about health benefits, it’s only fair to discuss risks as well. Saunas are reasonably safe, but people with medical conditions are often advised to steer clear, or to talk to a doctor before deciding to spend time in a sauna. This may include you if you are pregnant, have unusually high or low blood pressure, have epilepsy, or are taking stimulants, tranquilizers, or mind-altering drugs. Spending time in a sauna has also been linked to temporarily lowered fertility because heat impairs the production of sperm. The main danger of a sauna is that you could overheat or dehydrate; severe heat illness and dehydration can both be life threatening, and people have died in saunas. Alcohol makes you more susceptible; half of the people who died in saunas, according to a Finnish study, were under the influence of alcohol. (The authors argue that the biggest danger is not alcohol itself, but allowing a drunk person to be in a sauna alone.) So if you choose to spend time in a sauna, be smart about it. Hydrate well, don’t go alone, and don’t expect the sauna to do things that saunas can’t do. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        There's little worse than losing an hour or two of hard work, just by clicking on the wrong button or pressing the wrong key in Microsoft Word—a mistake that sees your well-crafted document (or a sizable portion of it) disappear before your eyes.A slip of the fingers isn't the only way you can potentially lose work, either. Maybe you just have the misfortune to be busy at your computer when a power outage happens—taking your desktop, Microsoft Word, and your unsaved work along with it.However, before you begin all over again, there are some tricks you can try to bring your work back. \nUse Undo (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z)\n    \n            \n            Word keeps an undo history.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSometimes, all you need is the undo command—hit Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (macOS) to undo your last action in Word. It might be enough to restore that table you accidentally deleted, or bring back that huge block of text you moved to the clipboard and have since lost track of.This won't save you from a power outage, and it doesn't include all actions (it won't bring back a file you've closed, for example). However, it'll work a lot of the time when you've made a mistake, and Word always keeps a record of your last 100 actions in the app, so you can go back a fair way.There's also an undo button up in the top left corner of the Word interface: Click on this to undo the last action, or click the arrow next to it to see a list of previous actions and choose where you want to go back to. To the right of the undo button is the redo button, which works the same way but in the opposite direction.Open previous file versions\n    \n            \n            Accessing previous versions in Word.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWord also has a file version history feature you can utilize to bring back lost work: It essentially saves past versions of your document at regular intervals, so you can go back in time, and even all the way back to the file's creation. It's like a super undo, which works between app restarts as well.In Word for Windows, you can find these older incarnations of your document by heading to File > Info > Version History. If you're using Word on macOS, it's File > Browse Version History. A new sidebar opens on the right, showing all the available previous versions, and the date and time they were saved.There is a caveat to this, though, which is you have to have your document saved in the cloud (in OneDrive) for this to work. If you're working with a local file that's only saved on your computer and you try and access version history, you'll be prompted to save it to OneDrive instead (which will turn on version history).Find unsaved documents on your system\n    \n            \n            Unsaved documents are sometimes still available.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWord actually saves files temporarily to your computer every so often, so if the program crashes without warning, you should see an autorecovery dialog pop up the next time you load Word, asking if you want to recover the old file. If not, you can see partially saved files by clicking Click File > Info > Manage Document > Recover Unsaved Documents.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's only for Windows, however—if you're on macOS, you're relying on the auto-recovery process. Word for both Windows and macOS lets you set how often auto-recovery files are saved: Head to File > Options > Save (Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save (macOS). The default is every 10 minutes, but you can adjust this if needed.If you're still not seeing your file, you can try checking the temporary cache folder manually. On Windows, check \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\" or \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles.\" On macOS try \"/Users//Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\"—adding in your own username where relevant.Save your work to the cloud\n    \n            \n            OneDrive gives you various extra options—including AutoSave.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThese days, Microsoft Word will tend to push you to save your work in OneDrive in the cloud. There are multiple benefits for this, including the version history feature mentioned above, and the option to collaborate on documents with other people. It also enables another handy feature: AutoSave.This is exactly what it sounds like, and means that every time something is changed in your document, it quickly syncs to the cloud. You'll see the AutoSave button in the top left hand corner enabled when it's active, and the document name at the top of the app window will indicate when saves are in progress.Should Word or your PC crash, your work should be safe. AutoSave is enabled by default for files saved to OneDrive, but you can customize this behavior by heading to File > Options > Save on Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save on macOS.\n            ",

The app has over three billion monthly active users, constantly messaging and calling one another across the globe. However, currently those calls are all happening over the mobile app, or maybe the desktop app. Though WhatsApp does have a web app, the service has never supported audio or video calls outside of its downloadable apps—until now. You can now make calls from the WhatsApp web appAccording to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is slowly rolling out audio and video calls to its web app. At launch, the functionality is coming to individual chats with users who elect to enroll in the WhatsApp web app's beta, but the company plans to roll out the feature to all web app users over the coming weeks.WABetaInfo notes that voice and audio calls work about the same as they do in the WhatsApp desktop app. When you open an individual chat in the web app, you'll now see a video call icon at the top. Click this, and you'll find two options: one to place a voice call, and one to place a video call. These calls are still end-to-end encrypted, as they are on WhatsApp's desktop and mobile apps, meaning only the users who are a part of the calls can hear what's being said. In addition, the web app's video call client supports Screen Share, so you can share a live stream of your computer's screen to another WhatsApp contact. \nWhatsApp is also reportedly working on group chat calls for web app users, as well. While that feature won't roll out alongside individual calls, when it does launch, you'll be able to join group chats with up to 32 people. If you tend to use the WhatsApp desktop or mobile apps, this might not seem like huge news—but it is pretty substantial for a few subsets of WhatsApp users. One, of course, is the user base that just prefers using WhatsApp in their computer's web browser—but the other is Linux users. WhatsApp doesn't actually offer a version of its desktop app for Linux, so those users have to use the web app if they want to run WhatsApp on their computers. That means they've never before been able to place calls without pulling out a mobile device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sign up for the WhatsApp web app betaThis feature will soon roll out to all web app users, but until then, you need to be running the WhatsApp web app beta in order to try it.Luckily, it's pretty easy to get up and running. To start, open the web app, then head to the settings menu, choose \"Help,\" then choose the \"Join beta\" option. This will immediately switch you over to the beta version of the web app. (You should see a \"Beta\" label on your screen.) Now that you're running the beta, should you find the option to place calls in individual chats. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The Alienware 34 Curved QD-OLED Gaming Monitor is 28% off at $499.99 (originally $699.99), marking its lowest price ever as the holiday discounts wind down.\nThis Alienware monitor, which earned a PCMag Editor’s Choice Award, sits on a sturdy V-shaped stand and has a curved 34-inch monitor with a 3440 by 1440 resolution and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Its curve isn’t as pronounced as some gaming monitors, such as the Corsair Xeneon Flex’s 800R curve; this one is 1800R, which reduces glare while deepening blacks and is ideal for those who don’t want overly dramatic curvature. It also features Alienvision, which lets you switch between four visual modes to tweak settings and maximize gameplay.Brightness is rated up to 1000 nits, and with a 165Hz refresh rate (10Hz less than its predecessor, but still excellent) and a competitive input lag of 1.4ms, it’s a popular choice for gamers seeking an immersive experience. Compared to its predecessor, this model swaps Nvidia G-Sync for AMD’s FreeSync Premium Pro. QD-OLED picture quality is this monitor’s main draw, giving users impressive contrast, true blacks, and dazzling colors for HDR gaming and strong performance in darker rooms. That said, it doesn’t have an HDMI 2.1 port.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFor anyone seeking a sleek OLED monitor that’s not excessively curved, with top-tier picture quality in both SDR and HDR, vibrant colors, and low input lag,  the Alienware 34 Curved QD-OLED Gaming Monitor remains one of the best ultrawide gaming and media monitors on the market. And at almost 30% off in a last-minute President’s Day deal, this Amazon deal might not last long. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Presidents' Day Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The Amazon-owned company aired an ad on Super Bowl Sunday for \"Search Party,\" its new feature that turns a neighborhood's collective Ring cameras into one network, with the goal of locating lost dogs. Viewers, however, saw this as a major privacy violation—it doesn't take much to imagine using this type of surveillance tech to locate people, not pets.The backlash wasn't just isolated to the ad, however. The controversy reignited criticisms of the company's partnership with Flock Safety, a security company that sells security cameras that track vehicles, notably for license plate recognition. But the partnership with Ring wasn't about tracking vehicles: Instead, Flock Safety's role was to make it easier for law enforcement agencies that use Flock Safety software to request Ring camera footage from users. Agencies could put in a request to an area where a crime supposedly took place, and Ring users would be notified about the request. They didn't have to agree to share footage, however. Law enforcement could already request footage from Ring users, through the platform's existing \"Community Requests\" feature. But this partnership would let agencies make these requests directly through Flock Safety's software. If a user submitted footage following a request, Ring said that data would be \"securely packaged\" by Flock Safety and share to the agency through FlockOS or Flock Nova.\nThat partnership is officially over. On Friday, Ring published a blog post announcing the end of its relationship with Flock Safety. The company said, after a review, the integration \"would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.\" As such, both parties have agree to cancel the partnership. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nImportantly, Ring says that since the integration never actually launched, no user footage was ever sent to Flock Safety—despite the company announcing the partnership four months ago. Social media influencers had spread the false claim that Flock Safety was seeding Ring footage directly to law enforcement agencies, such as ICE. While those claims are inaccurate, they were likely fueled by reporting from 404 Media that ICE has been able to access Flock Safety's data in its investigations. Had Ring's partnership with Flock Safety gone ahead, there would be legitimate cause to believe that agencies like ICE could tap into the footage Ring users had shared—even if those users were under the impression they were only sharing footage with local agencies to solve specific cases.  While privacy advocates will likely celebrate this news, the cancelled partnership has no effect on Community Requests. Law enforcement agencies will still be able to request footage from Ring users, and those users will still have a say in whether or not they send that footage. Ring sees the feature as an objective good, allowing users to voluntarily share footage that could help law enforcement solve important cases. In its announcement on Friday, Ring cited the December 2025 Brown University shooting, in which seven users shared 168 video clips with law enforcement. According to Ring, one of those videos assisted police in identifying the suspect's car, which, in turn, solved the case.    \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

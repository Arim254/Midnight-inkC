Pop in, get the shot, then go about my day. That process has now gotten even easier: Last year, the FDA approved the first flu vaccine that you can administer yourself, or that parents can administer to their children, and it's now available for at-home ordering. I just placed my order. And best of all: It’s a nasal spray, so no needles.How can you get the at-home flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine, called FluMist, still needs to be prescribed by a medical provider. But since nearly everyone aged two through 49 is eligible, FluMist’s maker (AstraZeneca) has a telehealth website that bundles the provider's approval with an order to an online pharmacy. The process takes about five minutes on average, they say, and I found that to be accurate. I've already had my flu shot this year, but my kids haven't gotten it yet. (I also know my daughter strongly prefers the nasal to the injection when possible.) The website allowed me to add multiple people to the same order, so I filled out the questionnaire for each child, giving their names, ages, allergies, and so on. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe website then reached into some big data cloud out there and told me it already knew their insurance information (existentially frightening, yet convenient!) and presented me with my bill: an $8.99 fee, which included $2.50 for physician evaluation and $6.49 for shipping and processing. Insurance covers the cost of the vaccine itself. Who can use the at-home flu vaccine? The at-home vaccine is the same as regular FluMist, which is approved for ages two through 49. That means babies and older adults will still need to visit a provider for the regular, injectable flu vaccine. Children can get flu shots starting at the age of six months.FluMist uses a live, weakened virus. It can't give you the actual flu, but it can cause some respiratory symptoms in people with weakened immune systems. So it's not recommended for people who are pregnant, have certain medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have close contact with an immunocompromised person. If that's you, talk to a provider about your best options. You may be advised to get the regular injectable type, which doesn't include any live virus. How do you give yourself the at-home flu vaccine? Mine hasn't arrived yet, but the instructions say that a package containing the vaccine will arrive at my door on the day I selected. It will be packed in an insulated container with cold packs, and should be put in the refrigerator upon arrival. There's also a tag I can scan to make sure the vaccine stayed at the proper temperature during the shipping process. Assuming that all goes well, you follow the instructions to spray the vaccine up your nose. (If you've gotten a FluMist at a pharmacy, it's the same idea.) Adults can administer it to themselves, and children will need an adult to do it for them. Instructions are, of course, provided. After you administer the vaccine, there is a prepaid envelope you can use to return the sprayers for disposal.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.There are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I attended MIPCOM in Cannes, France this year for the first time, and as someone who doesn't use generative AI in my daily life, let alone my writing or storytelling, the message to me was clear: Get on board or be left behind. AI is coming for television whether I like it or not. MIPCOM, the long-running annual global trade show for television and digital media, celebrated its 40th year last week in partnership with YouTube, furthering the bridge between the creator economy and traditional TV shows. Many influencers have already made the jump to our living room TVs—MrBeast, Lilly Singh, and others have leveraged YouTube fame as a springboard to more mainstream TV shows—and it's clear the industry sees them as light bearers for acquiring YouTube talent with built-in audiences. But AI feels different. While the gates are opening for content creators to reach wider audiences, AI can play a different kind of numbers game: Like a podcast company churning out 3,000 episodes of AI-generated content per week, most episodes can fail and it could still be a worthwhile return on the investment. One talk I attended, titled \"Infinite Creativity: Storytelling in the Imagination Age,\" put it this way: Even if 99.99% of AI-generated videos are poorly received slop, the remaining .01% is still more content hours than Hollywood can produce each year. Other panels echoed the same sentiment, with session titles like \"Monetizing Content in the Age of AI,\" \"Next in AI: Creative Innovation Showcase,\" and \"Nurturing Future Creative Leaders With AI.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nOne company, LoglineAI, described as an \"AI-led creative studio,\" invited me in an email to \"explore the future of storytelling.\" Their value proposition is using AI to \"deliver character consistency, multi-lingual dubbing with adaptive lip-sync, and emotion-aware visual storytelling, enabling faster, smarter, and scalable content production.\" I would have considered it bunk had I not attended so many sessions highlighting the success of AI-generated content. Like me, you may not know that \"slopcore\" content could be so popular.Vertical video—that is, anything meant to be viewed on a smartphone, like TikTok or Reels—is where AI-generated content has seen most of its success, and vertical micro dramas are already taking off in international markets. These short series typically run one to two minutes, with fast-paced drama often meant to be over-the-top and easy to digest. In one example, I saw a screening of a Turkish series called \"Legacy of Blood,\" a 300-style AI-generated micro drama that followed an obscenely ripped Spartan training his son to be a warrior. Another example, \"Nine-Tailed Fox Demon Falls for Me\" lives in the pre-mainstream gray area where it's both unknown and extremely popular: I had never heard of it and would bet you haven't either, but it's racked up over 200 million views. The plot is incomprehensible, but its nonsense is part of the appeal. In other countries like Colombia, micro dramas have become the most-watched form of TV, beating out both traditional television and streaming services.Whether AI-generated content will reserve its lane in vertical video or bleed into traditional TV is yet to be decided. You may remember Quibi as an example of micro dramas failing to gain traction, but numbers suggest that dismissing vertical videos would be a mistake. The trajectory of micro dramas in the Chinese market challenged many of my own assumptions: Vertical dramas bring five billion dollars in annual revenue, driven initially by middle-aged and older audiences before expanding in popularity on its way to catching up with the standard box office. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jordan Calhoun / Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSo should we expect a fall TV lineup to one day feature an AI-generated Spartan falling in love with a nine-tailed fox? How soon until we see AI slop served on our HBO or Netflix homepages? While micro dramas and AI-generated content will increasingly flood our phones, what I expect for TV is more indirect. The TV industry is relying on content creators telling stories, and many content creators are increasingly relying on AI.As TV networks continue to leverage online creator content as a sourcing pool for fresh programming, a growing number of creators are leveraging AI tools to keep up with the churn needed to be consistent and competitive. \"Storytelling in the Imagination Age\" means AI platforms are able to create videos of practically anything, and even if 99.99% of those videos are incomprehensible nonsense that fails, networks may rely on the remaining .01% that gains mainstream attention, like when Hollywood hoped to capitalize on Emojis or Angry Birds. The difference is that AI-based storytelling may not be so obvious. The future of TV won't be nonsensical AI slop, but it may be AI-inspired, and certainly AI aided. And I won't be surprised when I see a trailer one day from something as silly as the nine-tailed fox falling in love, and you shouldn't be either. Maybe the best we can do, then, is learn to recognize AI-written stories. Or learn to care less. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Apple's distinct new design language has been met with praise and criticism, with some users enjoying the refreshed look, and others bemoaning the UI's issues with visibility and consistency.  It seems Apple was similarly of two minds on the update, having toyed around with the exact look of Liquid Glass throughout the iOS 26 beta testing period. The company seemed to be having trouble settling on a specific balance between the design's glassy effect, which can look really cool, and its overall readability. If buttons are too clear, for example, they'll let in more of the background elements, which can make it more difficult to see them. But by reducing the glass effect too much by adding a tint to the icon and menu backgrounds, Apple risks loses the charm of the design entirely. (Some critics have dubbed it \"Frosted Glass\" by comparison.)While Apple is seemingly still continuing to tweak Liquid Glass, it appears the company has decided that part of the problem is down to user preference. So rather than stick with one look for the design, Apple is now working on a setting that lets you choose whether Liquid Glass looks more clear, or more tinted.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo be clear, or not to be clearThis new setting first appeared in the fourth beta for iOS 26.1, as well as iPadOS 26.1 and macOS 26.1, which Apple released on Monday, Oct. 20. The toggle, which beta testers can find in Settings > Display and Brightness (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings > Appearance on the Mac (macOS), gives users a simple choice in how Liquid Glass looks across their particular system: \"Clear,\" which is more transparent, and is in-line with Liquid Glass' original intent; or \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of menus and windows. You'll likely be able to read these elements better, but you won't see as much of the background shining through. \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nGiving tester what they asked for (sort of)During the pre-release beta testing period, some users called on Apple to add a Liquid Glass \"slider\" to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The idea was to allow users to fine-tune how Liquid Glass looks. Apple seems to have taken a different approach, offering only two levels of transparency with the new control. While a slider (or more transparency options, at least) would be great, what we're getting is better than nothing for users who prefer a more opaque Liquid Glass appearance.iOS 26.1 is still in beta testing, so it isn't clear (no pun intended) whether this feature will in fact make it to the official update, and if it does, whether it'll still work the same way. How to fix Liquid Glass right nowBut even without this dedicated settings page, there is something you can do to \"undo\" Liquid Glass: By kicking on the \"Reduce Transparency\" feature in Accessibility settings, you can achieve a similar look to choosing the new \"Tinted\" option. My guess, however, is that \"Tinted\" will achieve a more visually pleasing look, as it is something Apple deliberately implemented to work with the design of Liquid Glass, while reduce Transparency is simply a blanket effect that turns down transparency effects across iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Amazon Web Services experienced intermittent issues, throwing a huge fraction of the internet into chaos, as the sites and services built on it faltered or stopped working altogether. It was a sobering reminder that a lot of the world relies on AWS for networking, computing, and data storage. Truth be told, I was surprised to learn just how owned we really are, especially after a number of my work apps experienced issues. In fact, over four million business with a physical address use AWS for cloud-computing needs. It is the largest cloud infrastructure servicer in the world, with a whopping 30% of the market share. That's why when a global outage like this occurs, it's impossible to ignore: So many companies and products are affected, from streaming platforms like Prime Video, to social media sites like Facebook, that almost everyone who goes online will experience the disruption.But 30% is not 100%. AWS might be the market leader, but it is not the entire market. There are plenty of other cloud infrastructure companies out there offering similar services—and posing similar risks should they experience outages. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy use a cloud infrastructure company?It's not necessarily a bad thing for companies turn to an AWS for their computing needs. It's simply much more cost efficient to outsource the resources necessary for running programs, storing data, and hosting traffic, especially as businesses rapidly grow and change. Rather than spend the time and money constantly purchasing and upgrading on-site hardware, companies can pay for servers as they go. Companies like AWS will scale up or down as needed, without interruption to service—until, of course, there is an interruption to services.These companies can offer a host of cloud-based services and tools, including compute, databases, machine learning, networking, security, and storage. AWS just so happens to be the biggest of the bunch, but plenty of companies choose other cloud infrastructure options for their needs.AWS alternativesThere are many other companies offering the same services as AWS, but for our purposes, I'm going to list seven of the most popular, starting with AWS' main competitors: Microsoft Azure: Microsoft's cloud computing services is only second to AWS in terms of global market share. Microsoft obviously uses its own cloud infrastructure, but plenty of other companies do too, including Ralph Laruen, Best Buy, Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola, Abercrombie & Fitch, and even local, state, and federal governments.Google Cloud: Google Cloud is the third largest player in this space, with companies like Lowe's, Wendy's, EA, Fox Sports, Bayer, and McLaren all using its services. Alibaba Cloud: Alibaba Cloud has a large cloud computing market share, and is used by companies like Air Asia, Zara, Lenovo Group, and JNE Express. Oracle Cloud: Oracle Cloud includes customers like Quest Diagnostics, Baylor University, Smeg, Northwell Health, DHL, and MEO.Salesforce: Companies like Pacers Sports, Indeed, F1, and The Adecco Group use Salesforce's data cloud services.   IBM Cloud: Deloitte, Pfizer, Harvard, Vodafone, and even the US Open purchase cloud products from IBM Cloud.Tencent Cloud: You might know Tencent particularly from its massive games division, but its cloud services are also wide reaching. They include services for companies like L'Oréal Paris, Tim Hortons, and Dell, as well as its own subsidiaries like Supercell and DouYu. If there's a silver lining here, it's that there are more than just two or three companies powering sites and services around the globe, and we're not quite at the point where every company connected to the internet relies on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. That level of centralization would pose even larger risks than the ones we're currently living with.Still, present circumstance are, still pretty risky. AWS has 30% of the market share, Azure has 20%, and Google Cloud has 12%. Taken together, these three companies make up 62% of all cloud infrastructure companies around the globe. Yes, it's good the other 38% is spread out amongst a collection of other players, but the risk of another AWS-like outage is high. Hopefully, following Monday's debacle, there is work currently being done to prevent such a thing from happening again, but that's being optimistic.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

According to a recent post on the website formerly known as Twitter, the company will soon start selling “handles that are no longer in use” to paying subscribers.The feature, called the X Handle Marketplace, is currently only being teased, but a waitlist for it is live. Once active, it’ll allow X Premium+ subscribers (at the $40/month level) and Premium Business accounts to both request free (with their subscription, at least) handles, and directly purchase especially rare ones.Rare usernames could cost $2,500 or moreAccording to an FAQ page, pricing for rare handles starts at $2,500 and could go “over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.” You’ll also need an invitation to even be allowed to purchase a paid username, although receiving the complimentary handles also comes with complications.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFor free handles, there are two types. The standard ones, called “priority handles,” are open for any eligible subscriber to request; X says it will usually review requests within three business days, although not all requests will be approved. But X also says it will occasionally drop select rare handles (the type it would usually charge for) as part of free giveaways, where multiple subscribers can apply for the handle and a winner will be selected “based on merit.”As for what X considers “merit” to be, that would include past contributions to the site, intended usage for the handle, as well as engagement and reach on the platform.Once you’ve got a new handle, your current username will be locked so others won’t be able to change it, and your page’s @ will change to the new one. X also says it may offer paid redirects from old usernames to new ones in the future.Note, though, that if you got your new handle for free, you’ll need to stay subscribed to keep using it. Users who paid for their handles will be able to let their X subscriptions lapse without losing them.What handles X will be giving out for freeAs for what type of inactivate handles X will be giving out, the site has provided a few examples. Generally, paid handles will be pithy, one word, “culturally significant names,” like @Pizza or @Tom. Meanwhile, free ones are more likely to be full names or multi-word phrases, like @GabrielJones or @PizzaEater. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs someone who doesn’t subscribe to X, it’s the full names that have me concerned—and the ones I’d suggest logging into your account to preserve. Part of the reason I haven’t deactivated my X account yet is because I don’t want someone else to be able to make an account with my username, which is a variation on my full given name. I don’t post on it very often, but I’d rather others not be able to easily masquerade as me.With that in mind, I’ve reached out to X to ask how the website will decide when to make “inactive” usernames available to request, and will update this post when I hear back. X’s inactive account policy says that users should log in “at least every 30 days” to keep their accounts active, though, so if you’re concerned about your username being taken, it’s best to play it safe.To be fair to X, redistributing usernames from inactive accounts is not an unheard of practice for social media sites, although charging for them is a bit novel. X says the reason it’s requiring a subscription to access the X Handle Marketplace is “to prevent bot spam or misuse,” so that the site can make way for “fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”However, as hinted at by another change coming to the site, a subscribed account does not necessarily mean a bot-free account. I’m curious to see how the X Handle Marketplace launch goes once the feature hits the (paying) public.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

One that isn’t as commonly discussed is the THIEVES method. Use it the next time you break open a fresh chapter for school or need to retain a lot of new information for work.What is the THIEVES method?The THIEVES reading technique, recommended by universities like Kent State, is designed to get you thinking critically while you read. THIEVES is an acronym for the following elements of your content:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTitleHeadingsIntroductionEvery first sentence in a paragraphVisuals and vocabularyEnd-of-chapter questionsSummaryThe goal of using this method is figuring out what you want to learn from the chapter and how the information within it connects. By writing down each of the seven categories before you start, you’ll set the stage to get a bigger-picture view of the content before you start digging into it, similar to how the SQ3R or KWL methods work. How to use the THIEVES reading methodWrite down all seven of your categories—and I do mean write them down, since writing by hand can aid in retention. You can use your phone or a Word doc if you want, of course, but if you're looking for portability and modern convenience, I recommend handwriting, then digitizing your notes when you're done. After writing down the categories, from Title to Summary, and leaving some room under each, start jotting down what you want to gain from each one. Under Title, ask yourself what you think the text is about and what you already know about it based on the title. Under Headings, ask yourself why the information has been divided up this way, what you think you’ll learn in each section, and how the subtopics might relate to the bigger picture. From there, start reading, but mark down notes every time you encounter one of the THIEVES items. For instance, after the Introduction, write down what made you curious about the rest of the chapter after you read it, and make sure you do the same after Every first sentence in a section. Any time you get to a graph, picture, or table, write in your Visuals section about what each one represents and what they might tell you about the content and the bigger picture.At the End, jot down notes on how the author finished the chapter and what you learned, plus what you might learn in the future that relates to what you just went over. Finally, Summarize your reading, writing down what you think the author’s main idea was and your overall understanding of the primary themes and concepts.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis is a more structured form of close reading, a reading technique that forces you to pause and consider every tiny detail of a text. The author, publisher, and professor all have reasons for why they want you to read something, why details were left in or out, and why the material presented in the text is relevant. Everything in there matters somehow, which is what close reading is designed to help you figure out. When you use THIEVES, you give yourself a road map to make close reading even easier.During the \"summarize\" portion, try blurting, or writing down everything you can remember, then checking your notes against the material. You can also try making a mind map, which helps you visualize the connections between your concepts. If you struggle with those, reread the material until you retain enough to move on to the summary. It might take a few passes.Doing this before and as you read will help you stay engaged as you go, and it gives you notes to look back on when you review in the future. Use distributed study to determine how frequently you need to review these notes before your next big test. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

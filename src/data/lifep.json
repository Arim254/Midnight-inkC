Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you tried to follow your feeds on X, or engage with ChatGPT, you were only met with error messages. Compare those error messages to one another, however, and you'd likely notice a similar name affixed to them all: Cloudflare. Cloudflare's massive Tuesday morning outage had sweeping implications for much of the web. While it's not clear what caused the outage at this time, we do know whether the outage was responsible for a website's downtime. (When an error page says \"Cloudflare: Error,\" it's not difficult to track down the source of the problem.) As Cloudflare offers web infrastructure services to a huge number of sites, the true list of affected sites is likely massive. As an example, I wanted to convert the timezone Cloudflare uses in its status reports, UTC, to ET, and the first website I clicked on in my Google search returned an error. While there's no central repository listing each and every affected website, we can look at the sites with the largest number of user reports indicating issues this morning through Downdetector. (Disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Lifehacker.) Ironically, Downdetector itself was down this morning—it too uses Cloudflare.\nDowndetector is not a service that investigates and reports websites that are down. Instead, users can self-report issues with sites on Downdetector. As such, it can be illuminating to see which sites visitors were having issues with during the period of time Cloudflare was down. At this time, that includes the following:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nXCloudflareOpenAIChatGPTGrindrArchive of Our OwnAWSSpotifyLeague of LegendseClinicalWorksQuizletUberCharacter.aiCanvaClaudeVaroIndeedProcoreTruth SocialFanFictionArloDoorDashValorantRunescapeDayforceNJTransitSniffiesSquareGoogleZoomRoverCollegeBoardLetterboxd  Bet365MoneyLionDayZBetMGMYouTubeMicrosoftIKEASunoMicrosoft 365Canvas by InstructureMicrosoft TeamsAmazonGrokInstagramGeminiAgain, this list is not definitive, nor is it official.

When I tried to load sites like X, ChatGPT, or, ironically, Downdetector, I was met with various errors. X showed me an internal service error, while Downdetector asked me to \"Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.\" (I definitely do not have that authority.) You may experience similar errors on websites you try to load this morning, even ones you don't regularly visit. As part of this article, for example, I would google queries and click the top results to websites I had never heard of before, only to encounter similar error messages. That's because a large portion of the global internet relies on Cloudflare to operate. Cloudflare offers a host of services to companies, including web infrastructure and cybersecurity products. As such, when Cloudflare goes down, so do many of those websites—a bit of a domino effect.\nIt's not clear at this time what brought on the outage, but, as spotted by Techradar, Cloudflare had announced scheduled maintenance for some of its web servers for Nov. 18, ranging from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. UTC (7am to 10am ET), so it's possible something happened during this work to break service. The good news is, it appears that many of these sites are back up and running—at least, at this time. At 8:09 a.m. ET, Cloudflare reported it had identified the issue, and was working on a fix. At 9:42 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it rolled out the fix, and that the company believes the incident is resolved—though the official status page still says the Cloudflare Global Network is experiencing issues. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile this is indeed a big interruption to the internet, it's far from the first time this has happened. In fact, an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage broke the internet last month. With the Cloudflare outage this morning, it's an example of the risks of so many companies putting their web services needs in the same basket: If one servicer goes, so too goes a huge fraction of the web. Cloudflare will likely patch this issue sometime Tuesday, so I imagine we'll all be back to business as usual soon enough. I'll keep this article updated with developments as they come. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In its November fraud and scam advisory, Google is warning users about VPN apps and extensions that appear legitimate but are actually vectors for malware.VPNs may actually be spyware A VPN, or virtual private network, makes your internet activity much more difficult to track by routing your traffic through a different connection rather than your regular internet service provider (ISP). This allows you to hide your IP address and location, obscure your browsing data, and protect your information and devices from bad actors. According to Google, malicious VPNs (posing as real ones) are delivering infostealers, remote access trojans, and banking trojans to user devices once installed, allowing hackers to access sensitive personal data like browsing history, financial credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet information. This means that an app you rely on to keep your information private could be doing the exact opposite. Cybercriminals are capitalizing on user trust in these services, creating apps that look and feel like legitimate VPNs but are actually dangerous spyware. \nHow to ensure your VPN app is safeAs with any app or extension, only download or install a VPN from an official source like the Google Play store. While malicious programs do sometimes sneak through, it's typically safer and more reliable than sideloading through a messaging app or other unvetted site. In January 2025, Google launched a VPN verification process to help users identify trustworthy VPN apps in the Google Play store. To earn a \"verified\" badge, VPN apps have to undergo a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation and opt into independent security reviews. Badges are awarded only to VPNs that have been published for at least 90 days and reach 10,000 installs and 250 user reviews. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, this system isn't perfect either: As TechRadar reported earlier this year, a popular (free) Chrome VPN extension earned a badge and was later discovered to be spying on users. That's why you should rely on a reputable VPN service—which means you'll likely have to pay for it. Free VPNs are far more likely to a privacy nightmare, and any app that sounds too good to be true probably is. You aren't going to get unlimited traffic at no cost without sacrificing something. Finally, review VPN permissions carefully, and allow the minimum access possible for the app or extension to function.

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It saves me a lot of money and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Popular sites like X and ChatGPT were unresponsive, returning error messages rather than their usual homepages. The culprit? A massive Cloudflare outage.The upside is that the outage appears to be ending. Cloudflare says it has identified the problem and issued a fix, so affected websites should be coming back online this morning. But that doesn't change the fact that so many websites went dark today, all because one company experienced unexplained downtime. How is it that a Cloudflare outage can seemingly break the internet? What is Cloudflare?Cloudflare offers a number of products for sites and services with the goals of improving traffic performance and reliability, as well as cybersecurity. A company like Cloudflare spreads its network out throughout the globe, so that when users try to visit a website, the server they ping is the one closest to them. Rather than all users attempting to visit your server at once, they go through their Cloudflare server local. \nThis serves two main purposes: First, it limits the demand on your site. If all users were trying to ping your server at once, it puts a strain on your network, and could either slow things down or shut them down completely. Routing users to the Cloudflare server closest to them spreads out the demand, and reduces the risk of interruption. In addition, users are less likely to experience delays in physical distance to your network: If you're based in Japan, and your user is based in New York, it's going to take them longer to reach your server than it would a user from South Korea. However, if that New York user instead connects to a Cloudflare server closest to them, they can access your data much more quickly. Why does Cloudflare affect so many websites?Cloudflare's goal is to improve the experience for users around the world to visit international websites—so why does it seem like half the internet went dark when Cloudflare experienced an outage?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reason is because so many websites use Cloudflares services. According to Backlinko, over 24 million websites actively rely on Cloudflare in some capacity. That includes over 4,300 of the 10,000 \"most popular\" websites around the world. The U.S. alone has nearly 2,470,000 million websites relying on Cloudflare, while the UK has almost 780,000. Many other countries, like Brazil, Germany, Russia, Australia, Canada, China, India, and France, each have hundreds of thousands of websites running on Cloudflare.There are over one billion websites out there in the world, which means a total Cloudflare outage would account for roughly 2% of global websites' connectivity issues. However, if Backlinko's stats are correct, a huge percentage of popular websites rely on Cloudflare. Sure, the vast majority of websites may remain unaffected by this outage, but nearly half of the sites people most often visit have problems here. If you primarily visit U.S. websites, that number may be even higher. It's a similar reason why an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage takes down so many websites. AWS provides cloud computing services for so many companies and websites, that when issues pop-up, you experience problems with your favorite websites. It poses a logistical question for how the global internet currently works: Yes, it's great that services like Cloudflare make it possible to reliably access international websites as if they were within your region—but if too much of the internet leans on it, is it really all that reliable?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

After all, that's how you'll improve. But you have to remember to recognize wins big and small if you hope to keep yourself motivated. The balance between positive and negative as it relates to productivity is delicate, but you do always need to take breaks, do things you enjoy, and remember that you’re getting things done, even during stressful times. That's why you should try creating a “jar of awesome.\" What is a “jar of awesome?” The “jar of awesome” idea comes from Tim Ferriss’ Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers and it’s been popular for some time. Essentially, Ferriss recommends writing your wins down as they occur and putting the slips of paper into a jar. When you need a motivational boost, you can read through them. Visually, the jar even shows you just how much you have accomplished lately. \nThe idea is to help you focus not just on everything that needs to get done, but on what you’ve already done. It’s similar to keeping an accomplishment journal or updating your resume annually, even when you’re not job-hunting, in that it both motivates you and creates a record of your work. Crucially, it keeps that record in real time. It's much harder to remember everything you've accomplished if you try to do it retrospectively or under duress (as anyone confronted with filling out a year-end performance review knows well). With the jar of awesome, if you’re ever called into a surprise meeting about your work or have a review looming, you already have a list of your accomplishments ready to go. Ways to create your own “jar of awesome” Actually filling a jar with little scraps of paper is a touch twee and may not be that easy to keep up with when our lifestyles are so increasingly digital. There are plenty of ways to create a “jar” of awesome that don’t involve making your desk look like a Pinterest-inspired 2013 wedding. Try leaving a page or two dedicated to tracking wins in the back of your planner or creating a designated note on your phone. Create a single source of truth (SSOT) or a file on your computer or drive, dedicated to compiling your list of wins and supporting documentation. (Personally, I'm a big on using a notes app. My list of wins lives on my phone, where I can update it in a matter of seconds.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever you decide to do it, make sure all of the successes are listed somewhere together so the list grows visually. Just glancing at it can be a motivational push, to say nothing of reading through it all. Finally, don’t second-guess yourself when you want to add something. If you picked up the dry cleaning on a stressful day, got all the kids out of the house on time in the morning, or responded to all your emails by the end of the day and it felt good, throw it in. Just because it might seem small in comparison to a big looming project deadline doesn’t mean it wasn’t a win to get it done, so into the jar it goes. The goal is to keep track of just how much you really do accomplish, so don’t leave anything out.Finally, build your reviews into other elements of your productivity plan. When you're making SMART goals, for instance,—clearly defining what you want to do, why you want to do it, and when you need it done by—it's easy to look to past mistakes to see what you need to correct. At the same time, look back on your jar of awesome to see what's been working for you, so you can incorporate more of those elements into your future planning too.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I know I have done a poor job of keeping track of media as I have upgraded computers and phones over the years, and I've lost my fair share of photos, videos, and documents along the way, whether on misplaced or damaged external drives or from simply forgetting to back up at all. Here's how to ensure your data is available for years to come. \nYou need multiple backups of your dataOne approach to backing up your data is the 3-2-1 strategy, which says you should keep three copies of your data across two different forms of storage, one of which should be offsite (in case a disaster strikes your home). A simple example: You have your photos and files on your computer, which is backed up regularly to both an external hard drive and a cloud service. That's three copies of your data on two storage types—an onsite physical device and remote cloud storage—the latter of which satisfies the \"offsite\" requirement because it is geographically separate from your other two copies. This approach protects against a single point of failure, such as a primary device dying, losing an external hard drive, or getting locked out of a cloud account. When it comes to backing up your data, redundancy matters. As Reddit users note, there are different interpretations of how to apply the 3-2-1 rule, such as whether your working copy on your primary device counts as one of three and whether the one offsite copy is included in the two forms of storage. And while a strict 3-2-1 strategy, or variations of it, may be more commonly employed at the enterprise level rather than by the average consumer, you could think about it as a general guideline for improving your backup system, especially if you don't have one at all. How to set up backupsYou never know when a device might fail, so it's a good idea to plan frequent backups, whether your data is syncing regularly to the cloud or you set reminders to manually push updates to your external hard drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany users sync their devices automatically to a service like iCloud or Google Drive, but relying on this as your sole backup doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to access all of your files in the future. As HowtoGeek points out, these backups are typically mirroring what's currently on your device rather than historical versions—so once you delete a photo, file, or folder from your computer or phone, it's also deleted from the cloud backup. This is useful for quick access as well as restoring to a new or factory-reset device, but it doesn't do much for the scores of media collected over the years that you don't use daily. You could use a dedicated cloud backup service like IDrive or Backblaze, which come with a lot of storage space for automatic, full device backups. This may be best for users who have large files or a lot of media that is essential to their jobs as well as those who prioritize data privacy. (However, Wirecutter notes that most online backup services leave a lot to be desired.) Others may be fine to manually move files and media to free or low-cost cloud storage, including iCloud, OneDrive, and Google. At a minimum, another backup should live on an external hard drive—and if you're not going to do cloud backups, consider two external drives stored in separate locations. Hardware can obviously be lost, stolen, damaged, or simply degraded over time, so again, you shouldn't rely on a single drive for all of your storage. Apple's Time Machine and Windows File History make it easy to save backups to an external drive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Opening your statement to see expensive charges you didn't make is stressful, and canceling your card—and dealing with all of your attached subscriptions—is a nightmare. So if you get a call about an unauthorized charge for a brand new iPhone, you're probably going to want to get to the bottom of it. Here's the thing: It's likely a scam. I speak from experience: My wife keeps getting calls from unknown numbers, all of which leave voicemails about charges for iPhones. The voicemail starts off with what sounds like standard holding music. Suddenly, a voice pops in, saying something to the affect of: \"This is Amazon. This call is to authorize the payment of $999 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 16 Pro on your account. If you do not authorize this payment, please press \"one\" to speak to our customer support representative.\" Your call may also be about, \"the payment of $1,099 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 17 Pro on your account.\" We are inundated with the calls, and besides the payment amount and the specific iPhone model, the rest of the message is identical. As you might expect, no such charges are actually present on either our Amazon account or in our credit card history. That's because no one bought an iPhone in our name, or by using our financial information: This was simply a scam.\nHad we answered the phone and pressed \"one\" to speak with a \"customer support representative,\" or called the number back after listening to the voicemail, this is what would have likely happened: The \"representative\" would have assured us that they would be able to dispute the charge, but of course they'd need some information from us first. Perhaps they would have needed us to confirm the credit card information, and would ask us to read our digits out loud. Maybe they'd need to make sure we actually owned the Amazon account in question, and would ask for our two-factor authentication code to \"confirm our identity.\" No matter what the case, the scammers would have been praying on our concern about the charge to extract some type of sensitive information from us, all for their own financial gain. Had we called back and complied, we would have almost assuredly handed the scammers the money we thought they were helping us get back.  What to do if you get this voicemailIf you get a voicemail like this, don't call them back. If you pick up the phone, and you get this message, don't press \"one;\" just hang up. You are definitely being scammed, and there's no risk in simply ignoring the caller completely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you'd like to verify their claims, don't involve the caller at all. Instead, head to your Amazon account, and check your order history. You'll be able to see if any such iPhones were ordered under your account—and, if they were, you can cancel the order here. Similarly, check your credit card history: If you don't see a charge for an iPhone, there wasn't one. If you do see one, reach out to the credit card company directly through their official contact information.  Scammers rely on pressure tactics that stress you out, and make you feel like time is of the essence. It rarely ever is. While it might seem common practice for companies like Amazon to call customers about large charges, it really isn't. If you ever receive unsolicited communications from someone claiming to represent a company you belong to, you can always end the conversation, and reach out directly yourself. If you contact Amazon's official customer support, or the company that issues your credit card, they'll be able to confirm or deny the claim for you.  While you can block the number, it might not do much good. Each time we've received a call, it's been from a different number, so my guess is they're not reusing numbers when calling you back. Instead, you should strongly consider using one of Apple's built-in anti-spam tools. If you're running iOS 26, you can choose to have your iPhone screen calls from unknown numbers, and ask for information before sending the call your way. No matter which version of iOS you have, you can also choose to silence unknown callers en masse, so you're never interrupted by any caller that isn't in your contacts. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There are Chromebooks with OLED screens, high refresh rates, and even light-up keyboards, but no matter how many bells and whistles you slap on a Chromebook, it's still not going to have nearly as much raw processing power as a more traditional laptop.That's where cloud gaming comes in. This lets you stream games from the cloud, if you're willing to put up with a certain amount of video compression and input delay. One of the most popular cloud gaming services is Nvidia's GeForce Now, which lets you play select free-to-play titles and PC games you already own using the company's own data centers. The catch is that you either have to watch ads or pay up—but today, Google's Chromebooks are getting an exclusive new tier of GeForce Now that fixes both of these issues.Called GeForce Now Fast Pass, this version of GeForce Now is sort of like an expanded version of the existing free tier. You'll still be limited to playing at 1080p and 60fps—higher specs will require you to pay—and you won't have access to GeForce Now's \"Install-to-Play\" games, which means the library of compatible titles will be closer to 2,000 than 4,000. But unlike the free tier, you won't have to watch any ads, and you won't have to wait in a queue to start playing. Nvidia says the typical free-tier queue is only two minutes long, but hey, the sooner you can hop into the action, the better.\nStarting today, all new Chromebook purchases will come with a free year of GeForce Now Fast Pass, but there are some caveats. The big one is that you only get 10 free Fast Pass hours per month, although up to five unused hours will roll over to the next month.That means you'll still have to keep track of your time while playing, even if you don't have to watch ads. A Google spokesperson told me over email that once your Fast Pass hours are up, you'll be downgraded to the basic, ad-supported free tier, or you can purchase more Fast Pass hours a la carte. I wasn't told exactly how much these hours will cost, but given that a day pass (meaning 24 hours of play) of GeForce Now with no ads and higher specs than Fast Pass costs just $3.99, I can't imagine they'll be too expensive.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for when your year of Fast Pass is over, I'm still waiting for an answer on how to renew. I'll update this post once I hear back. I've also asked whether users that already have Chromebooks will be able to sign up for GeForce Now Fast Pass.One last bonus for Fast Pass, though, is that you don't have to actually use it on your Chromebook. You'll need a Chromebook to sign up (I'm also still waiting on exact steps for that), but once you've redeemed the offer, you'll be able to use it on any GeForce Now compatible device, like a phone or tablet.Overall, it doesn't exactly seem like something I'd go out of my way to buy a Chromebook for, but it could be a decent way to get good enough performance to play through about one short game per month, all without having to pay for GeForce Now or deal with ads or wait times. Combine that with the free games that sites like Epic give out on a regular basis, and you could essentially game casually for a year without buying anything other than your Chromebook. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFinally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Now, they've initiated proceedings against four more companies—the makers of the Samsung Galaxy Ring, Reebok Smart Ring, Amazfit Helio Ring, and the Luna Ring. Oura announced on their website that they have filed an ITC complaint against those four companies. The ITC is the U.S. International Trade Commission, and Oura says its complaint is \"for the unlawful importation and sale of products that infringe on several of Oura’s patents.\"Oura's previous win against Ultrahuman and RingConn resulted in a judgment that those companies had to stop selling and importing their smart rings. RingConn ultimately came to an agreement with Oura to license their patents and continue selling their rings. Circular and Omate have made similar agreements with Oura.\nUltrahuman no longer sells their ring in the U.S., but is working on a new ring design that would sidestep the alleged patent infringement. You can read Ultrahuman's take on the situation in this blog post, which also includes a promise to continue supporting rings that they have already sold or that people may buy from resellers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe rings in the recent complaint should still be available for a while. Oura says on their blog: \"So what’s next? The ITC process will run its course.\" There's no guarantee that Oura will win their case, although the fact they were able to get such a sweeping judgment against other companies suggests that it's not too much of a long shot. While Oura's communications around this issue use phrases like \"respect for IP\" (that is, intellectual property), as a consumer and a reviewer, I hate to see an exciting tech area get dominated by a single player or, worse, shut down by that player piece by piece. I'm working on a review of the Luna ring, which I've previously noted has some serious potential improvements over other rings on the market. Here's hoping the smart ring category remains a lively one going forward.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Enable dark mode for easier reading\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI suffer from migraines and to keep the headaches at bay, I use dark mode wherever I can. In macOS 26 Tahoe, Preview now allows you to enable dark mode for any PDF file, which means that I no longer need to deal with bright white backgrounds when I have to go through any PDF document. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview on your Mac. Now click the View button in the menu bar up top, and select Use Dark Appearance for PDF.\nInsert pages in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview lets you easily add pages to a PDF file. You can either add a blank page or insert a page from a different file. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview, and go to Edit > Insert. You can either choose Blank Page or Page from File….The option to insert a blank page in the PDF is self-explanatory. If you want to insert a page from a different file, there are different ways to do so. The option in the Edit menu will directly insert the whole PDF or image file you select into your PDF. This is fine when you're selecting a single-page PDF that needs to go into a bigger file, but it's not ideal if you want to add just one page from a 50-page document. If you're trying to do this, add pages by opening two PDF files side-by-side in Preview, and dragging pages from the first to the second PDF file. If the sidebar is hidden in Preview, go to View > Thumbnails. You can now drag the thumbnail from one sidebar to another with ease.Reorder pages in a PDF \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you want to change the order of pages in a PDF file in Preview, just drag and rearrange the thumbnails in the sidebar. It's quite smooth and intuitive, and you'll be able to get the job done pretty quickly.Delete pages from a PDF file \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview has a page deletion feature built in, too. Once again, just open a PDF file in Preview, select any page in the sidebar, and press the Delete button to remove the page from your PDF document. This option is also available under Edit > Delete.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate, edit, and redact text in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use basic markup tools to add, select, edit, and redact text in Preview. These tools, along with the options to annotate and sign PDFs, are all available under the Markup Toolbar in Preview for Mac. To access these tools, open any PDF in Preview, and click the pencil icon in the toolbar. Alternatively, you can go to View > Show Markup Toolbar. These tools are more than sufficient for quick edits to PDF documents.Add a PDF password\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use Preview to add a password to a PDF file, or to remove passwords from a file. To add a password to the PDF file you're viewing in Preview, go to File > Edit Permissions, and check the box labelled Require Password to Open Document. Once you've added and confirmed the password, you'll also have to add an owner password to the document. The owner password lets you restrict others from making changes to the PDF file, printing it, etc. Ideally, it should be different from the password used to open the PDF file. With both passwords added, click Apply to confirm the changes.Rotate pages in a PDF\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, PDF files arrive with an unusable orientation—e.g., portrait pages scanned in landscape mode. In such cases, you can use Preview to rotate the pages of a PDF. Just go to the page you want to rotate and press Command-L to rotate it left or Command-R to rotate right. Fun fact: You can also do the same thing using your trackpad. Use two fingers to mimic a rotating motion and you'll see that the page of the PDF file rotates to the left or the right.These options are also available under the Tools menu. Over there, you'll also find options to flip a page horizontally or vertically, as well as a feature that removes the background from a PDF page.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

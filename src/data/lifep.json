By default, trackers steal a <em>lot</em> of your data while you browse the web, but simple settings can block a lot of those trackers from functioning. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">by updating to iOS 26</a>, your iPhone gets an upgraded tool against tracking.</p><p>The feature, called Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, is an option in Safari that hides certain browser and device data trackers typically use to build a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/enable-this-ios-26-privacy-feature-to-make-it-harder-for-others-to-track-you/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">digital \"fingerprint\" of users</a>. In this case, a fingerprint is a profile companies use to track your movements across the web. Your fingerprint may be made up of data like your device's IP address, the device itself, your browser, fonts, plug-ins, as well as its screen resolution. All of these data points come together to build a unique picture of who you are; the more unique your fingerprint, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/cover-your-tracks-see-whos-following-you-online\" target=\"_blank\">the easier it is to track you</a>, since the odds of someone else with your exact same details is slim. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Fingerprinting has a number of applications across the web, but perhaps the largest is for targeted advertising. The reason many of the ads you see are so relevant to your interests and browsing history is because of fingerprinting. Trackers know your internet habits, and can identify and deliver the advertisements you're most likely to click or tap on. Companies can also sell these fingerprinting profiles to brokers and advertisers, making money on both your engagement with ads, as well as your raw data.  </p><p>Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection simplifies each Safari user's data, so our fingerprints aren't quite so unique. By doing so, it's harder for trackers to identify individuals, and, as such, makes it possible to browser the web more privately. </p><p>This feature was already a thing on iPhone before iOS 26. However, it was limited to Private Browsing by default. If you didn't do all your browsing in a private tab, you likely lost some of these privacy protections, unless you knew to manually change the setting to cover all browsing. The same goes for iPadOS and macOS as well. Most of us probably didn't change the setting, since it's quite buried in each OS' respective settings.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Once you update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the latest OS, however, your browsing gets these added tracking protections by default. Whether you browse in a private or a normal window, trackers will have a difficult time identifying your device. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-check-your-advanced-tracking-and-fingerprinting-protection-settings\">How to check your Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection settings </h2><p>This setting should be enabled by default when you update your device. But if you want to make sure it's on, here's where to find it. On your iPhone or iPad, open <strong>Settings</strong>, then head to <strong>Apps > Safari > Advanced</strong>. On your Mac, open Safari, press Command + , to pull up Safari's settings, then choose the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</p><p>From here, ensure Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection is set to \"All Browsing\" (iOS/iPadOS) or \"in all browsing\" (macOS).</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Apple can keep adding new features and designs with each new smartphone iteration, but if the company just announced a new iPhone with record-breaking battery life, customers would be thrilled. </p><p>While we may have to wait for a time when the iPhone can go a couple days in between charges, Apple has added a new option to iOS 26 in an effort to help extend your iPhone's battery life. The feature, Adaptive Power, uses on-device AI to analyze your iPhone usage and guess the times you'll need additional battery life. This is exactly how I want to see AI being used—not for generating <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-realistic videos</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/spotify-ai-music-policies\" target=\"_blank\">musical slop</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-adaptive-power-tries-to-boost-your-battery\">How Adaptive Power tries to boost your battery</h2><div><p>When Adaptive Power decides it's time to engage, the feature can adjust your iPhone's performance level. This will make some tasks take longer than they normally would, but that slower speed supposedly saves on battery life. In addition, Adaptive Power lowers screen brightness by 3%, limits background activity, and, when your iPhone reaches 20%, kicks on Low Power Mode without asking you first. </p><p>Apple isn't totally clear here about the difference between Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power in general. From what we know, it seems that Adaptive Power simply reduces processing speeds at select intervals, and only slightly lowers brightness, while Low Power Mode slows speeds and display refresh rate, and limits brightness, 5G, iCloud syncing, and mail fetch, among other tasks.  </p></div><p>Adaptive Power is enabled by default on Apple's newest iPhones, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air—the latter of which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">could most likely benefit from such a feature</a>. For all other compatible iPhones, which includes iPhone 15 Pro and newer, the feature is turned off by default. That means, unless you have an iPhone 17 device, you'll need to turn this on yourself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-turn-adaptive-power-on-or-off\">How to turn Adaptive Power on or off</h2><p>Whether you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 17, you'll find the controls for Adaptive Power in the same place. Open Settings, then head to <strong>Battery > Power Mode</strong>. Here, you can tap the toggle next to \"Adaptive Power\" to turn the setting on or off. </p><p>Since Adaptive Power turns on and off throughout the day, Apple also offers you the option to receive alerts whenever the feature is active. You can adjust this setting from the \"Adaptive Power Notifications\" toggle.</p><p>I've been using Adaptive Power since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26 dropped on Sept. 15</a>, but it's tough to say whether the feature has had a noticeable impact on my battery life. I think it would help if Apple added Adaptive Power information to my battery stats, so I could compare the impacts before and after using the feature. For now, I'll continue using it, if for no other reason than to offer my battery the best possible chance of making it through the day without its charger. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Oct. 7 to Wednesday, Oct. 8. Lifehacker's Prime Day expert <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/danieloropeza\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Oropeza</a> explains all the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-october-prime-big-deals-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\">details you need to know about the event</a>. </p><p>As you're scouring for the best deals, one payment option you'll want to reconsider is \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/dont-use-buy-now-pay-later-for-prime-day-purchases\" target=\"_blank\"><u>buy now, pay later</u></a>\" financing.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Last year Apple discontinued its own take on “buy now, pay later” (BNPL), called \"Apple Pay Later.\" The service may no longer be available in <em>name</em>, but BNPL purchases are readily available when you check out with Apple Pay. So, what exactly has changed about paying with installments via Apple Pay, and what sets it apart from other BNPL programs—for better or for worse? </p><h2 id=\"what-is-buy-now-pay-later\">What is “buy now, pay later?”</h2><p>A “buy now, pay later” service is exactly what it sounds like: You can make a purchase immediately, and then pay for it through a series of installments over time. Although BNPL has some perks for breaking up a major expense, there are risks involved. Even if these loans have little to no interest, you are still taking on debt. And while BNPL plans don’t directly impact users’ credit scores at the moment, that's set to change. Coming this fall, <a href=\"https://investors.fico.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fico-unveils-groundbreaking-credit-scores-incorporate-buy-now\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">FICO says</a> it will start including BNPL payment histories in how it calculates credit scores. If you're at risk of not getting your BNPL payments in according to schedule, you'll be putting your credit score at risk, too.</p><p>Any personal finance writer with a semblance of a conscience <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-to-know-before-using-buy-now-pay-later-financing-1844945584\" target=\"_blank\">will advise against</a> making a habit of using these services. They can be helpful if you really need to finance something big, but whenever possible, it’s best to avoid taking on debt for everyday expenses.</p><h2 id=\"how-can-you-pay-with-installments-using-apple-pay\">How can you pay with installments using Apple Pay?</h2><p>The official \"Apple Pay Later\" is no more, but Apple Pay still includes BNPL options. Major BNPL providers like <a href=\"https://www.affirm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Affirm,</a> <a href=\"https://www.afterpay.com/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Afterpay,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.klarna.com/us/payments/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Klarna</a> have partnered with Apple to offer their services directly through Apple Pay.</p><h3>How to set up BNPL with Apple Pay</h3><p>The setup process varies slightly depending on your BNPL provider:</p><p><strong>For Klarna:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the Klarna app and create an account.</p></li><li><p>Complete the verification process.</p></li><li><p>In the Klarna app, look for the option to add to Apple Wallet.</p></li><li><p>Follow the prompts to add your Klarna card to Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p><strong>For Affirm:</strong></p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ol><li><p>Create an Affirm account through their app or website.</p></li><li><p>Get pre-qualified for spending limits, up to $30,000.</p></li><li><p>Add the Affirm virtual card to your Apple Wallet.</p></li><li><p>Use it like any other payment method in Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p><strong>For Afterpay:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the Afterpay app and set up your account.</p></li><li><p>Link a debit or credit card for your installment payments.</p></li><li><p>Afterpay should pop up directly at checkout when using Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p>When you make a purchase using BNPL through Apple Pay, the total amount is automatically divided into your installment plan. Your first installment is typically charged immediately, while the BNPL company pays the merchant the full amount. All your subsequent installments are automatically charged to your linked payment method according to schedule.</p><h2 id=\"the-risks-of-bnpl-programs\">The risks of BNPL programs</h2><p>Naturally, Apple users may be drawn to the convenience of a BNPL options during Apple Pay checkout. However, that convenience might just be the biggest risk. They can make it all too easy to spend more than you can actually afford. The <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-publishes-new-findings-on-financial-profiles-of-buy-now-pay-later-borrowers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a report</a> that shows BNPL users were more likely to have higher credit card debt, delinquencies on other credit products, and lower credit scores than non-users.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>If you are going to use any BNPL service, keep these tips in mind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Think about your current and future budget.</strong> When a bigger payment gets broken down into smaller installments, you might find yourself overspending in the long run because it \"feels\" like you can afford it. Stay on top of how much you’re actually spending, and how it will impact your overall budget going forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stick to the essentials.</strong> BNPL should really only be used on completely necessary purchases that you can’t afford upfront, but can afford in six weeks. </p></li><li><p><strong>Keep an eye on your account balance.</strong> Klarna, Affirm, or an BNPL service are not credit cards. Even if Apple doesn’t charge fees for missed payments, your bank will still charge you overdraft fees. Plus, if you default on a BNPL loan, you’re at risk of damaging your credit score.</p></li></ul><p>The most important thing is that you know what you're doing. Before you pay for anything in installments, be thoughtful about why you’re taking on this debt in the first place.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>On Tuesday, Apple dropped <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-releases-first-ios-26-1-beta-with-some-subtle-iphone-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the first beta for iOS 26.1</a>. With it, we can see what the company is planning for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">the successor to iOS 26</a>, including new gestures in Apple Music, a new scrubbing bar for the video player, and Liquid Glass support for the keypad in the Phone app. It's a small update on the surface, but there's something quite interesting going on behind the scenes. </p><h2 id=\"notification-forwarding\">'Notification Forwarding'</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by Macworld</a>, code within the iOS 26.1 beta suggests that Apple is working on support for third-party smartwatches in future versions of iOS. Macworld found references to a new feature called \"Notification Forwarding,\" which supposedly would allows users to direct alerts from their iPhone to a device not made by Apple. It's a bit vague, as that could mean anything from a tablet to a PC, but Macworld believes it is intended to support notification forwarding to non-Apple smartwatches.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The code also seems to indicate that this feature supports notification forwarding to one device at a time. If you were to set your notifications from your iPhone to a Galaxy Watch, for example, it might disable notifications to your Apple Watch. In addition, there are references to an unfinished feature called \"AccessoryExtension,\" which might support pairing third-party watches to your iPhone. </p><p>Notification Forwarding and AccessoryExtension could be indicative of a big change for Apple. One of the things that makes the company so successful is its \"ecosystem,\" the idea that Apple's products are designed to work seamlessly together. If you have an iPhone, it connects to and works with iPads, Macs, and, of course, Apple Watches. When you try to connect to and work with third-party devices, however, you run into road blocks. </p><p>Smartwatches might be among the biggest hurdles here. Apple's smartwatch, of course, does everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do with your smartphone. But if you're thinking of picking up a Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch, it's a different story. In fact, there's really no way to pair one of these to your iPhone. If you're coming from Android and you try to use your Pixel Watch with your iPhone, you're going to have a bad time. \"Notification Forwarding\" could offer a bridge.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Some smartwatches, like those from Garmin, do offer notification forwarding support already, so the feature wouldn't necessarily be groundbreaking. But it could expand smartwatch options for users beyond the limited devices that currently work with iOS' notifications. </p><h2 id=\"two-reasons-you-might-not-see-these-changes-on-your-iphone\">Two reasons you might not see these changes on your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get too excited, there are a couple of caveats here. First, these changes are not an active part of iOS 26.1; rather, they are simply references within the code. That indicates this is something Apple is working on, but not necessarily something that will definitely launch. Until we see the features appear in a future beta update, it's possible this will simply remain an experiment. </p><p>And even if Apple does roll out these changes, it might only be to a select group of users. There's a chance third-party smartwatch support is solely targeted towards the EU, following the union's <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-dma-eu-connectivity-interoperability-proceedings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Digital Markets Act</a>. That legislation requires Apple to open up iOS to third-party devices, which, notably, includes smartwatches. Apple doesn't tend to open up when it doesn't have to, which is why the EU has third-party app stores on iOS and the rest of the world does not. We could see yet another EU-specific feature in this case: Europeans might be able to use their Android watches with iOS, while the rest of us are stuck with Apple Watches. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/seven-changes-that-helped-me-stick-to-my-home-fitness-routine\" target=\"_blank\">ever-expanding quest to get better at working out</a> at home. I wanted to put it into action right away, so naturally, I turned to my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Peloton app</a>, where I figured I'd load up a Pilates workout and get to work. Weirdly, though, that wasn't as easy as it is when I, say, want to follow along with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a> class. Eventually, I figured it out and the Pilates workout (which did incorporate my hoop, thank you very much) was great—and challenging, which is how I like it.</p><h2 id=\"where-to-locate-pilates-classes-on-the-peloton-app\">Where to locate Pilates classes on the Peloton app</h2><p>I knew Peloton had Pilates classes. But when I opened up the app, there was no designated Pilates button the way there are buttons for <strong>Meditation</strong> and <strong>Cycling</strong>. I typed \"Pilates\" into the search bar at the top of the mobile app and it brought up 95 class results, some of which were actually categorized as yoga and others which were listed under strength. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>So, there <em>are</em> Pilates classes, but they're listed on different landing pages. Across the top of the search results page, you see <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Programs</strong>, and <strong>Music Artists</strong>. Tapping <strong>Collections</strong> yields a landing page called \"Pilates with Equipment,\" which has subcategories: Pilates with a Ball, Pilates with Sliders, Pilates with a Band, and—crucially, for me—Pilates with a Ring. There are only a handful of classes in each and they're all technically filed as \"strength classes\" in Peloton's system. I selected \"15 min Pilates\" from the section that incorporates the magic circle. </p><p>Things got harder from there. I wanted to play the class on my TV, which is possible because Peloton has an app on the Roku, but there is no search function on the Roku app. Instead, you have to look through the categories to find a class—which I couldn't do, since there is no Pilates category. I ended up getting the one I wanted by adding it to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">my Peloton Stack</a>, which is like a personal class playlist; deleting everything else from the Stack; and running the Stack on the Roku app. It wasn't efficient or ideal, but ultimately, it worked. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-pelotons-pilates-classes-are-like\">What Peloton's Pilates classes are like </h2><p>As much trouble as I had actually finding a class, I hadn't even technically done the \"hard\" part yet. Pilates is supposed to be challenging, after all, and the intermediate-level class I took definitely was. Armed with my mat and my hoop I followed along with some standard moves, like \"hundreds\" and clam shells. It was difficult, but not impossible, which is exactly what I was looking for. </p><p>Again, there are only 95 of these types of classes available and some are more about stretching while others are more strength-focused. That's a small selection compared to how many other types of classes Peloton offers. But what <em>is</em> available is solid. The instruction is clear and precise, modifications are offered, and the audio/video quality is top-tier, making it easy to hear and see what you're supposed to be doing. </p><p>I did the Peloton class last night and took an in-studio reformer class this morning. Granted, my in-person class was four times longer than the one I did from Peloton, but I'd say that adjusted for time, they were both equal in challenge. Because I am now the proud owner of a hoop <em>and </em>the knowledge of how to find high-quality, expert-led Pilates classes to play through Peloton, I'll certainly be doing more of these. Here's hoping we get a dedicated Pilates page on the Peloton app soon.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

The new \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>\" design, while controversial, offers the first major UI overhaul since iOS 7, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">new features</a> like call screening and hold assist might change the way your make and receive phone calls. </p><p>If you have an iPhone, you may be tempted to install the new update—and, seeing as it has been out for a week and a half now, you might have updated already. If you haven't installed iOS 26, yet, however, think twice before you do, because you're going to be stuck with it: Apple has made it impossible to downgrade and return to iOS 18.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-go-back-to-ios-18\">You can't go back to iOS 18</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple stopped \"signing\" iOS 18.6.2 on Monday. When Apple signs a particular piece of software, it means you can download that software to your compatible device. Apple stops signing software shortly after it releases a new version. It's a system meant to block users from installing old software versions on their Apple devices, intended to protect those users from insecurities in operating systems that haven't been patched.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As such, now that iOS 18.6.2 is no longer being signed, there is no way to downgrade to that software version from iOS 26 if you change your mind. Though the process was tedious, previously, <a href=\"https://x.com/badboychadhoy/status/1970549101973418116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you could downgrade from iOS 26</a> by putting your iPhone in recovery mode, erasing it completely, and installing a new version of 18.6.2. Now that Apple has stopped signing 18.6.2, however, there's no way to install it, so a factory reset will only leave you with an iPhone running iOS 26, and none of your data.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You might be wondering why you can't downgrade to iOS 18.7, since that's a newer version of iOS 18 than 18.6.2. <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/post-34169189\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As users on the MacRumors forum point out</a>, you need an IPSW file in order to downgrade your iPhone, but Apple hasn't provided an IPSW file with iOS 18.7, as that update is only available over the air for uses already running iOS 18. That is to say: Unless your iPhone is already running 18.6.2, you can't install iOS 18.7.  </p><p>If you haven't updated your iPhone yet, you have two options. First, there's nothing<em> forcing </em>you to install iOS 26 on your device. You can keep running iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.7 as long as you want, and take advantage of any future security updates Apple provides to keep your iPhone protected. Alternately, you can go ahead and install iOS 26, with the understanding that you won't have the option to undo it—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">though you will be able to undo many of the UI changes</a>, at least. And if your main concern is performance and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">battery life</a>, it might be smart to wait for iOS 26.1, which is currently in beta testing. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

We are giving you a $5 credit towards your next month of service that can be redeemed after Jan 16 when paying with a credit card online. This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us. If you’re still having trouble connecting, please restart your device (power down and power back on).The amount may be smaller, but it does seem to be a bit more convenient to claim, since it sounds like you can apply it while paying your bill (although I can't make any promises for people using auto pay). Like Verizon's offer, it also doesn't seem to be discriminating between those affected by the outage and those who weren't, as noted by a user on Reddit.\nSome comments from other Visible subscribers on Reddit did point out that they had yet to receive the text, although I'm assuming that's due to a slow rollout more than anything else, as textless users who reached out to customer service were able to confirm they were offered the $5 credit as well. I've reached out to Visible to confirm if the $5 credit applies to everyone, and will update this post when I hear back (I also asked if it would be applied to automatic payments).As for why the payment is so much smaller, it's probably due to the difference in cost between Verizon and Visible. Verizon said it based its $20 payout on the price for \"multiple days of service,\" and frankly, those same days cost much less on Visible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile Visible uses the same network as Verizon, it sets itself apart by giving its users lower priority while connecting, which lets it offer unlimited plans starting at $20/month. Prices range to $33/month, but essentially, $5 goes a lot further on the low cost network, meaning it represents a similar value to $20 for a proper Verizon plan.Whether that's a fair price for an unexpected day of spotty connectivity, I'll leave up to you.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you enter your debit or credit card into one of these fake card readers, your data is stored for later download or transmitted wirelessly in real time to a device controlled by scammers, who will use the information to steal from your accounts. Unfortunately, online shoppers aren't immune from this scheme. Web skimming is a type of cyberattack that uses malicious code to steal card data during checkout, and researchers have identified an ongoing campaign targeting major payment providers and, by extension, consumers. Online credit card skimmingWeb skimming attacks, broadly referred to as \"Magecart\" campaigns, are initiated when malicious JavaScript is injected into e-commerce websites and payment portals. When a checkout page loads, the skimmer replaces it with a spoofed form that collects card numbers, expiry dates, card verification codes, and billing or shipping addresses—everything threat actors need to turn around and use your card for fraudulent purchases. \nThe fake payment forms use legitimate-looking branding and styling to minimize suspicion. Once payment details are transmitted to the attacker, the user gets an error message and is redirected to the real checkout page, a flow designed to make you believe that you've simply entered your information incorrectly. Web skimmers are typically designed to avoid detection and may even self-destruct, making them difficult to identify even for site admins. They also utilize bulletproof hosting, which shields cyber actors from takedown requests and law enforcement action. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect your payment cardUnfortunately, consumers can't do much about the presence of web skimmers, but they can play defense against them. Red flags of an online shopping scam are also red flags for skimming—for example, deals and discounts that are too good to be true are indicators of a possible fraudulent vendor or malicious site, where you may be more likely to have your card details stolen. Shopping with reputable vendors will reduce (though not entirely eliminate) the risk. You should also be vigilant about any unusual steps during checkout, such as redirects or error messages, and abandon any suspicious transactions. If you suspect that your payment details may have been stolen, keep an eye on your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized activity, and enable transaction alerts for real-time updates. Remember that credit cards offer more security protections than debit cards. You could also use virtual cards for online purchases, which allows you to keep your actual card details private and protect you from further fraud. (Note, however, that virtual cards have some drawbacks. For example, you may lose some protections offered by your primary card provider and have a tougher time obtaining refunds.)\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The wireless carrier's coverage was down for large swaths of the country for much of the day, leading to confusion, frustration, and, for some, conspiracy theories. I saw some users on X post cryptic messages like \"This is how it starts,\" and \"These are the end times.\" It's good to know in times of service disruption, we can all keep a level head. But despite claims to the contrary, the world didn't end yesterday, and Verizon fixed the issue. The company issued a statement at 10:20 p.m. ET, confirming the outage had been resolved, and that Verizon would contact affected customers directly to issue account credits. While that doesn't necessarily make up for a full day of network downtime, at least Verizon users can get back online and make calls when not connected to wifi.But some customers out there aren't back to normal. In fact, they're still seeing the same \"SOS\" alert on their phones they saw yesterday. For these users, the outage is very much still happening, as they cannot access the internet or communicate with others without either going through satellite connectivity, or finding a wifi connection. When you need to be out and about, especially on the road, that isn't an option. \nHow to get your Verizon phone out of SOS mode Luckily, there's a simple solution here, one that Verizon shared in its post about the outage's resolution: restart your phone. It doesn't matter if you already restarted your phone yesterday during the outage: In order to see results, you'll need to power off your phone and turn it back on after Verizon implemented its fix. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDifferent smartphones have different restart methods, but here are some tips for the most popular models:Restarting an iPhone: Press and hold one of the volume buttons together with the side (power) button, until you see the power-off slider. Slide to power off, then wait for the screen to go totally black. After about 30 seconds, you can press and hold the side button to power it back on. Note: If your iPhone has a Home button, you can simply press and hold the side button to pull up the power-off slider.  Restarting a Samsung Galaxy: Press and hold the volume down button and side button until you see power options appear. Here, choose \"Restart,\" then tap \"Restart\" again. Restarting a Pixel: If you have a Pixel 6 or newer, press and hold the volume up button and side button for a few seconds, then tap \"Restart\" when it appears. If you have a Pixel 5 or older, simply hold the side button until the phone restarts.If your phone model isn't listed here, you can search the internet for specific instructions on how to restart it. Typically, though, the process involves holding both the side button and one of the volume buttons.   \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

According to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments. The scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic). \nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers. A nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBetterment data hackedCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. If you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For example, that seemingly endless time spent shivering in the shower while you wait for the water to heat up. Or that painful moment when you go to wash your hands and water that feels like it’s being pumped directly from the Arctic splashes you.Waiting for the water to heat up is an age-old problem caused by simple laws of physics: Your water heater is far away from the tap or shower head, and it takes time to flush out the cold water in the pipes. But there are ways to speed up your hot water delivery. The easiest is to install a tankless water heater, but those can cost thousands of dollars to install, and require a lot of space your house may not have. If you want to speed up your hot water without taking on that much of an expense, you have a few more affordable choices.Install a recirculating pumpOne reason it takes a while for hot water to arrive is time: When you turn off the faucet, the hot water sitting in the pipes starts to cool off. The next time you turn on the tap, that cooled water has to be pushed out of the hot water pipes before the hot water can arrive.\nTo solve this, you can have a recirculating pump installed at a cost typically under $1,000. These pumps are installed on your existing water heater, and work by continuously circulating the water in the pipes so it never sits there, cooling off. Because it’s installed at the water heater, it speeds up hot water to your appliances, as well, including washing machines and dishwashers, which can help them operate more efficiently.Point-of-use tankless heatersWhile a whole-house tankless water heater can be a big and expensive project, what’s known as a “point-of-use” tankless water heater can be a more manageable and affordable solution. These are small enough to install under a sink, and are designed to provide hot water on demand just at that point of use. The heaters themselves typically run a few hundred bucks, with installation typically running less than $1,000. Because of their small size, it’s feasible to install one of these yourself if you’re comfortable with plumbing and electrical work, but they can require careful calibration, so hiring a professional plumber is probably your best move.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInsulateSince part of the problem with slow hot water is heat loss as the water sits in the pipes, you can sometimes improve the situation just by insulating your hot water pipes thoroughly. This is definitely a DIY job if you can identify and access your hot water pipes, and it’s not a terribly expensive job to hire out, costing as little as $350 on average. It’s just a matter of wrapping the pipes with insulating cuffs, then taping everything off so it’s sealed up nicely. This can help keep water hot while it sits, so the next time you turn on the faucet, you get the hot water you expect.Adjust restrictorsCold water has to drain out of your pipes for the hot water to hit your faucet or showerhead, so one possible way to speed things up is to remove any flow regulators/restrictors that have been installed. These simple devices do exactly what it sounds like: They restrict the flow of water, conserving energy and water and keeping your utility bills lower. But since they restrict flow, they also mean it can take longer for cold water to drain off and hot water to arrive, so removing or adjusting them can reduce the time it takes for that hot water to get to you.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications. Maybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.The application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).The whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.It's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.I don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That was due to Verizon's nationwide outage, which affected roughly two million customers across the United States. If you were among them, you couldn't use your phone on the go, which is sort of the idea behind cellphones in general. This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send work emails or messages, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or perhaps because of it), the company seems keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced it had resolved the outage, it also said it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowVerizon made a post on X, once again apologizing for the outage and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive. If you're among them, Verizon says they will text you when the credit is available. When it is, you can log into the myVerizon app to claim your recompense.        \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

But keeping track of which applications are using the internet—and how much data they're using—is still useful at times, as is blocking apps from accessing the net entirely.While you're traveling, for example, internet access might be limited, so it's a good idea to cut off applications that constantly churn through data. But even while at home, it's a good security practice to review which applications are connecting to the internet. And while macOS comes with a firewall, it's not really a useful tool for that.Which is why I like FireWally. This totally free application, offered by the Ukraine-based indie Mac developers Nektony, isn't a tool for power users—it's streamlined and user friendly. Click the menu bar icon and you'll see a list of applications using the internet. You can see a summary of all traffic today, in the past hour, or monitor incoming traffic in real time.\nBeside every application is its data usage. You can see a breakdown of inbound and outbound traffic for any application by hovering the mouse over it. You can block any application from accessing the internet by toggling the switch.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWhat if you don't recognize an application? I, traditionally, ended up copying the name of the application and pasting it into a search engine. FireWally tries to save you some time by providing AI-generated summaries of each application using Apple Intelligence (assuming your Mac supports that feature). It's a useful way to quickly remind yourself what a particular application is, or to identify one you don't recognize.It's a very streamlined application, but perfect for anyone hoping to understand a bit more about how much data their various Mac applications are using. Give it a spin if you're looking for a simple firewall application.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great. Microsoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless. Microsoft's \"Handoff\" moment is coming   As spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps. \nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board. As Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.  It's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability. How to enable Resume on WindowsThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The entire ecosystem seemingly exists to manipulate you, which can make finding clarity hard. I've written about how to avoid anxiety bait, which can be an important step toward healthy and productive engagement, but an important step is recognizing when you're being manipulated. RageCheck is a potentially useful tool here.Built using concepts from social science research, this website can analyze any link or screenshot. It points out examples of potentially manipulative language, from us-versus-them framing to emotionally loaded phrasing. \"The system analyzes text for linguistic patterns commonly associated with manipulative framing—language optimized to provoke high-arousal reactions over understanding,\" says the methodology page. \"It does not assess factual accuracy or political bias.\"Using the site is simple: just paste a link to an article and hit Enter. After a few moments, you'll see a statistical breakdown of the potentially manipulative language in the piece across five categories—emotional heat, us versus them, moral outrage, black-and-white thinking, and fight picking. The article is excerpted below, with examples of these tactics highlighted. In the left panel you'll see a \"Bait Score,\" which is an attempt to calculate how manipulative the article is being. Below that, you'll see a list of the potentially manipulative techniques employed in the article.\nNone of this is intended to be used as an alternative to fact checking or serve as some kind of truth-detecting machine. \"A high score means content uses manipulative framing—it doesn't mean the underlying claims are false,\" says the about page. \"Conversely, a low score doesn't mean content is true.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's worth pointing out that the techniques this tool detects also aren't necessarily bad. Some news stories really should inspire moral outrage, especially in the context of an opinion piece or editorial. Regardless, there's still value in identifying those techniques.Basically, this is a tool that can help you think critically about the media you're consuming, not do that critical thinking for you.

While some users love the new Liquid Glass design across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, others decidedly do not—which is likely what led Apple to introduce a dedicated setting to control the intensity of the effect. I'm partial to it, but I understand for some users, it's a tad too much, especially if it makes certain UI elements more difficult to see. But Liquid Glass isn't the only thing Apple users have complained about, especially with regards to macOS Tahoe. Mac users reported various problems with performance and stability across macOS 26.0 and macOS 26.1, and have criticized design choices like overly rounded corners. Myself, I held out on updating my M3 Pro Mac until macOS 26.2, where many of these issues appeared to be fixed, but my M1 iMac is still on macOS Sequoia for the time being. All that to say, macOS 26 hasn't had the smoothest start compared to some of Apple's previous Mac updates. If you've been noticing, for example, that your Mac's window management isn't as cooperative as it's been in the past, you're not alone. In fact, there seems to be a clear explanation for what's behind the issues. The issue with windows on macOS TahoeAs with other versions of macOS, you can resize and adjust your Mac apps' windows by clicking and dragging from the bottom corners. The issue, however, is that as of Apple's newest update, it can be fairly difficult to grab the corner of the window. You might, instead, find you click on the bottom corner of the app or website instead, leading to unintended actions. Clicking the top right corner of Chrome, for example, will drag the whole app window, rather than resize it. Clicking the bottom left corner and dragging will start to highlight everything in the app window instead, perhaps sending you all around the screen as well. \nIf you slowly hover your cursor over the corner of the window, eventually you'll find a spot that turns your cursor into a resize icon, and you'll know you're good to click and drag to resize. But why is this so much more difficult to do quickly than it was in macOS Sequoia or beyond?Norbert Heger, a software developer, seemingly has an answer. In a blog post on Sunday, Heger explains that those rounded corners Apple designed for Tahoe are having a negative impact on the clickable area of the window. With a square corner, most of the clickable area—Heger says 62% of it—lies within the corner of the window itself. That gives users a relatively large area to click within the corner in order to grab onto the window, and a little bit of room outside the window to click, as well. But these new rounded corners don't seem to take that into consideration. Instead, they're relying on the same click area as before, but because there's less corner to work with now, the actual clickable area of the window is far less. Heger says about 75% of the clickable area now exists outside the window itself, giving users just 25% to work with in the actual corner of the window. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're running macOS Tahoe, you can try this out for yourself right now: Move your cursor to the corner of the window, and wait for it to change into the resize icon. If you're hovering within the window itself, it won't change until you're just about to move outside the window. You can keep going a bit, and see you can get pretty darn far outside the window before the cursor changes back. \n    \n            \n            Why am I able to resize the window from outside the window, Apple?\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThis seems like a relatively easy fix on Apple's part, assuming they're aware of the issue. Maybe a patch will even make it into macOS 26.3. That said, the company has not publicly acknowledged the quirk, so it's anyone's guess. Until a potential fix, those of us on macOS Tahoe will just need to retrain our muscle memories around window resizing. For anyone who hasn't upgraded yet, you can simply carry on as usual. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.POP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.How to keep your third-party accounts working in GmailIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.Use IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.The IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Do you wish you could take care of all those updates at once? Updatest is an application made for exactly this.I've talked about Homebrew for Mac, which is a command line tool for installing and updating Mac software. Updatest scans all the software on your computer and updates it using Homebrew, even if you didn't initially install it that way. But there's more. Many applications use an open source tool called Sparkle to offer updates, and Updatest can find and update all of them. The application can also identify applications downloaded from GitHub that have newer releases, along with any application you downloaded from the Mac App Store.Basically, if an application has updates, Updatest can find them and install them for you. To get started, click the download button on the app's website (you can also install using Homebrew, if you've already set that up). The application will tell you a bit about how it works, ask you which categories of applications you want to update using the tool, and offer to install Homebrew if you haven't done that already.\nOnce you're done with all of that, you will see a list of all the applications on your system. You can filter to see only the apps that need updates, if you want.Click any application to learn more about the update. From here you can install the update. Alternatively, you can click the Bulk Update button below the search bar to update all of your outdated applications at once. You can watch the updates happen by clicking the Terminal button in the top-right corner, or you can let the application do its thing while you work on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome updates require passwords, in which case you'll be asked to run the update command in the Terminal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd in some cases, applications from the Mac App Store won't update—in my tests, this was mostly iPad apps I've installed. The application will instead give you a link to open the App Store and install the update.These minor annoyances are inevitable, and not too burdensome. And it's nice to be able to check all of my applications for updates in once place. If you're interested, there's a 15-day free trial, allowing you to get a feel for how the application works. After that you can buy a personal license, which works on up to three Macs, for $9.99; a household license, which works on up to 10 Macs, costs $19.99.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

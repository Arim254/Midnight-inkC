The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        It's Christmas time, and people believe a lot of inaccurate things about the holiday, so for the next few weeks, I'm going to take a look at the truth behind Christmas mythology, starting with the biggest misconception of them all: Not \"how can the North Pole support an industrial infrastructure large enough to build toys for all the world's children,\" but whether Jesus was really born on Dec. 25.  Was Jesus born on Dec. 25?Most Christians celebrate the Baby J's birthday on Dec. 25, but he probably wasn't born on that day. The Bible doesn't provide a specific date, neither does any historical document, and early Christians didn't even celebrate Christmas. So Jesus could have been born on Dec. 25, but he could have been born on March 7, or any other date. Here are some popular alternatives for Jesus' birthday:January 6 or 7—favored by  Orthodox ChristiansNovember 18—according to Clement of AlexandriaMarch or April—based on Biblical passages describing shepherds watching their flocks.September or October—based on John the Baptist's father's membership in \"The Order of Abijah.\" This theory is too complex to explain here, but it's fascinating, and I urge you to fall into the priestly division of Abijah rabbit hole like I did. If Jesus wasn't born on Dec. 25, why is it Christmas?No one knows for sure why we have mostly landed on Dec. 25 as Jesus' birthday, but there are theories. Here are two of the most common:\nSolar Theory: The first solid reference to Jesus being born on Dec. 25 was in the Calendar of Filocalus, a Roman almanac written in 354. The calendar denotes Dec. 25 as both Christ's birth date and the date of an older holiday, \"The Birthday of the Unconquered Sun,\" suggesting both holidays were celebrated on the same day in Rome (or were at least listed that way by the 4th century). The theory is that Romans were like \"we celebrate the day anyway\" and early Christians were all \"we got your unconquered sun right here\" and accepted the 25th to celebrate, eventually outlasting the Romans and leaving the pagan holiday a footnote that no one celebrates besides my friend Gary.Calculation Theory: Early Christians believed that prophets and martyrs died on the same day they were conceived—I assume a second-century skeptic carved a scathing tablet debunking this, but it's what many early Christians believed. Jesus' martyrdom/conception was said to have happened on March 25, so his birth would be on Dec. 25 (assuming he was punctual.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are other theories—the date was chosen to coincide with Hannukah, Saturnalia, the re-dedication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, or the Eagles/Bears game in 2006. The point is we don't actually know, but it's probably a \"little from column A, a little from column B\" situation. The Calculation Theory provided a theological justification for the date, and the Solar symbolism provided cultural relevance; both Jesus and Santa like when we work together, after all. What is the true meaning of Christmas?Ultimately, the murkiness around Jesus' exact birthday isn't important. Christmas doesn't exist because a Roman bureaucrat wrote it on a calendar or some pagans wanted to blow off steam. Whether you celebrate Christmas as the birthday of Christ or a mid-winter celebration of light, the holiday's meaning was been built collectively over centuries, and is molded and changed constantly to fit the needs and desires of the people who celebrate it. Whether that celebration is a somber religious expression or listening to Mariah Carey while drinking eggnog, it's all good. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The consequences are high: With stolen credentials, scammers can gain full control of your accounts and your money. According to the FBI advisory, criminals will quickly wire funds from your bank to cryptocurrency wallets, making the money nearly impossible to trace and recover, and lock you out of your account in the process. Here's how account takeover scams work—and how to avoid becoming a victim. \nAccount takeover scams may impersonate your bankMost account takeover scams use social engineering: a series of tactics designed to manipulate you into giving up personal information, downloading malware, or paying money to bad actors. Scammers impersonate financial institution employees as well as customer support and technical support staff and reach out to targets via text, call, or email to say that their account has been compromised in some way.They may tell you that there have been fraudulent charges on your account and send you a link to report the fraud—but this is actually a phishing site designed to harvest your login credentials. They may ask directly for your username, password, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) code over the phone. In some cases, they may even claim that your information was used to buy firearms and pass you off to a second scammer impersonating law enforcement. They're counting on you to feel fear and confusion and act quickly to \"resolve\" the issue by handing over your information. The FBI has also identified a version of account takeover using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, in which scammers buy ads that appear to be for legitimate businesses but actually allow them to place malicious links to spoofed bank websites higher in search results. How to avoid falling for account takeover scamsWhile being targeted for an account takeover may be unavoidable, there are a few red flags that can help you identify the fraud before it goes south. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you should always be wary of calls, texts, emails, and other communication (such as social media messages) from someone claiming to be from your bank or creditor, especially if they ask for personal information like your username, password, or time-based one-time password (TOTP). Reputable institutions will not contact you to request your credentials or other sensitive data—so these are almost certainly phishing attempts. You should also be wary of trusting websites that look like they belong to your financial institution, especially if you click to them from a browser search. Cybercriminals can easily build convincing (but spoofed) websites and place the malicious links at the top of search results. Bookmark the trusted link rather than going through a search engine, or use the verified app on your mobile device. Always avoid clicking directly from unsolicited communication, and check URLs and email addresses carefully, as scammers can also use homographs to hide malicious links.  Finally, protect your personal information. Use complex, unique passwords stored securely (such as in a password manager), enable a stronger form of MFA (and never give away codes), and limit what you share online. Scammers may use what you've posted—like your date of birth, pet's name, or information about family members—to get past your security questions, guess your password, or make an impersonation attempt sound more convincing. The IC3 also recommends monitoring your financial accounts for irregularities, such as unauthorized withdrawals or transfers, which may be a sign of an account takeover. Consider setting up transaction alerts with your financial institutions to be notified immediately of any suspicious activity. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Android 16 officially started rolling out back in June, with most of the Material 3 Expressive visual overhaul added in a major update in September. Now, the second big Android 16 update is here, ushering in a host of new features across notifications, customization, accessibility, and device restrictions.As is the norm, this update will arrive on Pixel devices first. For other Android devices, including those made by Samsung, it's up to each phone and tablet manufacturer to adjust the software update as needed and push it out to their users. Despite the limited rollout, Google says this marks a \"new chapter\" for Android releases, which, going forward, will be \"more frequent\" rather than once a year. In other words, we might be seeing Android 17 much sooner than expected. But we won't see it today. We're still in the Android 16 era, which is about to get the following new features and changes:\nMore interface customization\n    \n            \n            You now have more control over home screen icons.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nCustomization has always been one of the strengths of Android, and this Android 16 update brings with it a bunch of features to help you change the interface in a more flexible and consistent way. Home screen icons can now have custom shapes, while themed icons are auto-applied across apps.Both of those changes should mean that when you play around with the visual look of Android, there isn't a jarring icon or two that stands out from the rest—everything should look more uniform. \"Your phone should reflect your own unique aesthetic,\" Google says, and these tweaks should help.There's also an improvement to dark mode: Dark mode will now be applied across all apps, even those that haven't been coded to include a dark mode by their developer. Again, the end result should be a more consistent visual look, plus extra savings on battery life if more of the screen is dimmed more often.Improved parental controls\n    \n            \n            More parental controls can now be managed on-device.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIf you have kids who use an Android device, you'll know the current parental controls are a little bit clunky, and mostly managed remotely. Going forward, more of these controls will be available on the actual devices your youngsters are using, which should mean they're easier to access and manage.The new on-board settings will be protected by a PIN, so your kids can't change them, and will cover screen time, downtime schedules, and app usage. You'll also be able to add more time for app and device usage from the phone or tablet that's being used, which is more convenient if you're actually with a child.Additionally, Google is making it easier to set up a Google Family Link from Android 16 phones and tablets, which is where the family connections and device rules are set to begin with. Other key parental controls, including protections over purchases and location tracking, are still managed remotely.AI in your notifications\n    \n            \n            AI will group and summarize your notifications.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nTechnically launched in last month's Pixel Drop, Android 16 now summarizes your notifications for you through the power of AI—something that tech companies are continuing to push, in an effort to save us all time and avoid notification fatigue, even if the results have been mixed so far. Why Google is announcing it alongside these other new features isn't clear, but it's a good reminder for any Pixel users who might be interested in trying it out.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI summaries are something Apple introduced for the iPhone, then partially pulled for certain apps, then brought back. According to Google, these AI summaries will give you \"quick understanding and context at a glance\"—so let's hope they understand what's important in your group chats and what isn't.On top of that, we're getting AI-powered notification organization too, with \"lower-priority notifications\" (which Google says include promotions and social alerts) silenced and grouped together so they're not so much of a distraction. As yet, it's not clear exactly how much control you'll get over how all this works.And even more updates\n    \n            \n            You'll be able to mark your calls as urgent in the future.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThere are plenty of other minor updates rolling out to a broader selection of Android devices too, not just those running Android 16. They include more expressive closed captions; ease-of-use improvements to accessibility features, such as TalkBack (voice dictation) and Auto Click (using a mouse with Android); and pinned tabs in Chrome for Android.Emoji Kitchen is getting more features and more ways to combine emojis, Circle to Search is adding a scam detection feature (just point it towards a suspected scam message), and group chats in Google Messages will now come with options for reporting issues—chats can be easily left, blocked, and reported.We'll also soon be getting a beta version of a feature Google has named Call Reason, in the Phone app. This lets you mark your outgoing calls to saved contacts as urgent, which they'll see when you ring them (and might encourage them to pick up. For more details on this and everything else rolling out to Android from today, see the official blog post.\n            ",

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday or Cyber MondayWhen you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ \"Black Friday\" or \"Cyber Monday\" tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it's the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, impulse buyers may not fully realize what they're buying.How to tell if a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.To avoid a low-key scam, do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The deal runs through Cyber Monday. The standout here is that you’re not just getting a license for Visual Studio, which is already a powerhouse development environment, but also lifetime access to more than 60 hours of beginner-to-advanced coding instruction.Visual Studio Pro 2022 itself is widely used in professional environments, built for serious dev work—think C#, Python, .NET, and more. You get tools like IntelliCode for AI-assisted coding suggestions, built-in Git support, debugging, and advanced testing features, all of which are useful whether you're building a small app or working on enterprise-level projects. Normally, licenses for just the IDE can get expensive, so getting it bundled with a full curriculum covering JavaScript, React, Python, CSS, and more is the kind of package that feels designed for someone starting out with ambition or a side hustle in mind.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this is a Microsoft-centric deal. If you’re aiming to become a Mac-based developer or work heavily with Xcode and iOS projects, this probably won’t be your best fit. The same goes if you’re already deep into development and just looking for a few advanced certifications, as some of the coursework may feel too foundational. But if you’ve been stuck in tutorial limbo, this bundle provides structure, software, and real-world tools at a reasonable price.

We had new albums from Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Tyler the Creator, and, of course, Huntrix (of KPop Demon Hunters fame), just to name a few. You may have listened to any number of new albums that came out this year, mixed in with music that released any time over the last century. You might not even remember what you were listening to back in January. But Apple Music remembers, and will serve in up to you in your 2025 Apple Music Replay. Like last year, your Replay is available in your Apple Music app. If you're relatively new to the streaming service, that might sound obvious—especially if you've previously used a service like Spotify that offers a similar annual wrap-up. But this wasn't always the case: For much of Apple Music Replay's brief history, you had to visit a separate website, music.apple.com/us/replay, and log into your Apple Music account in order to access your recap. It seemed silly, considering Spotify Wrapped is very much an in-app experience, but it took Apple until 2024 to get with the program.That said, it seems Apple has made additional improvements this year. In 2024, the experience was essentially contained in an in-app browser, where it loaded your Apple Music Replay with the same UI as the website. This year, Replay is a native function of the Apple Music app, at least on iOS. \nHow to access your 2025 Apple Music Replay \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can still access your Replay from the official website, but the easiest way to review it is from the app on your iPhone or iPad. Open the app on your device of choice. Make your way to the Home tab if the app doesn't open there automatically, then tap or click on the large Replay option, which should appear at the top left. (This option also shows up in the Music app for Mac, but it will automatically direct you to the website in your browser.) Whichever way you access it, you'll be able to see all of your Replay months here (excluding December, of course, since the month just started), but let's focus on 2025 as a whole.Unpacking your Apple Music ReplayAt the top, you'll find a Replay your year in music tile. Tap Play Your Highlight Reel and Apple Music will walk you through your year. Here's what you can expect, at least based on my results: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you'll see your total listening minutes, complete with both a collage of the albums you listened to most, and one of your top-played songs playing in the background. Next, you'll see your top artist of the year, with a collage of their images and a relevant song playing in the background. The following slide is a breakdown of your top artist by monthThe next will show if any artist was your number one for multiple months. Next, you'll see the number of songs you listened to, complete with your top song of the year. Then you'll see the number of albums you listened to, and which one was your top choice. Second to last, Apple Music tells you your top genres of the year, including the one you listened to mostOne final slide summarizes the whole year.You don't have to watch the highlight reel to see these stats: Once out of the reel, you can scroll through the Replay page to see everything covered in the slides, plus additional stats. Mine shows top artists, songs, and albums by month—so I can see which artist defined March (Will Stratton), which song I listened to most in August  (\"The Subway\" by Chappel Roan), and which album I played on repeat in May (\"Tunnel Vision\" by Beach Bunny). I also see top playlists of the year; different listening milestones, like Minutes Listened, Artists Played, and Songs Played; stats from last year's Replay; and a playlist of my top songs of the year. Many of these stats, both in and out of the highlight reel, are easily sharable. You'll see a share icon next to any stat you can export, which makes it simple to share fun graphics with friends or on social media. I've already blown up the group chat with some of my stats here, and I expect many of you to do the same. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You download the apps you want to use, log into your accounts, and presto: You can stream anything with a few clicks of your remote. But smart TV apps aren't the only way people watch shows and movies on platforms like Netflix. Among other methods, like plugging a laptop directly into the TV, many people still enjoying casting their content from small screens to big screens. For years, this has been a reliable way to switch from watching Netflix on your smartphone or tablet to watching on your TV—you just tap the cast button, select your TV, and in a few moments, your content is beamed to the proper place. Your device becomes its own remote, with search built right-in, and it avoids the need to sign into Netflix on TVs outside your home, such as when staying in hotels. At least it did, but Netflix no longer wants to let you do it.\nNetflix no longer supports casting on most devicesWhile you can still cast to your TV from other streaming platforms, there's bad news for Netflix fans: The company has abruptly dropped casting support for most devices. Android Authority was the first to report on the change, though you might have stumbled upon the development yourself when looking for the cast button in the Netflix app. In fact, Netflix has prepared for your confusion, as you can see from this Netflix Help Center page titled \"Can't find 'Cast' button in Netflix app.\" This page might offer a glimmer of hope at first, as you think \"Oh good, Netflix has a solution if the Cast button is missing.\" Unfortunately, the response isn't going to make you happy: \"Netflix no longer supports casting shows from a mobile device to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. You’ll need to use the remote that came with your TV or TV-streaming device to navigate Netflix.\"The exception here is for \"older\" Chromecast devices or TVs that work with Google Cast—but only if you pay for an ad-free Netflix plan. If you took Netflix up on its lower-cost subscription offer, those ads not only cost you extra watch time, but also your ability to cast—assuming you even have the older hardware to cast to. While Android Authority was the first major publication to report on the issue, some Netflix casters have been living with the change over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 14, this user posted on the Chromecast subreddit voicing their complaints about the change. They were particularly frustrated with the lack of communication from Netflix, as the Cast button was removed \"with zero warning.\" Other users in the thread noted their frustrations, too, with some threatening to cancel their subscriptions over the issue.  Why is Netflix removing support for casting?Netflix doesn't explain why it's making the change, so I can only speculate. First, it's totally possible this is simply a tech obsolescence issue. Many companies drop support for older or underused technologies, and perhaps Netflix sees now as the time to largely drop support for casting. Streamlining the tech the app has to support means less work for Netflix developers, and it wouldn't be the first time the company dropped support for older platforms. However, that doesn't really explain why the company still supports some devices for casting. Maybe it took a look at its user base, and made the calculation that enough subscribers relied on Google Cast devices for casting, but not enough relies on newer hardware for casting. We might not really know unless Netflix decides to issue a statement.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, I can't help but feel like this is related to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing. The company clearly doesn't want you using its services unless you have your own paid account—or have another user pay extra to have you on their account. Casting, however, makes it easy to continue using someone else's account without paying for it. Since Netflix only requires mobile users to log into the account owner's home wifi once a month to continue watching on a device, you could theoretically cast Netflix from your smartphone to your TV to continue enjoying your shows and movies \"for free.\" By removing casting as an option for most users, those users will either need to connect a device to the TV by wire—like a laptop connected via HDMI—or log into the smart TV app. And if those users don't actually have permission to access that account via that app, they won't be able to stream. If this really is the company's intention, it's doing so at the inconvenience of paying users, too. If you're traveling, you now need to bother with signing into your account on a TV you don't own. If you don't like using your smart TV apps, you're kind of out of luck, unless you want to deal with connecting a computer to your TV whenever you want to catch up on Stranger Things. How to fix Netflix casting issues with compatible hardware If you do meet the new requirements for casting on Netflix, and the cast button still isn't appearing, Netflix does have some troubleshooting steps you can take on its Help Center page. It's device-dependent, but generally, here's what you should do:Check your Chromecast's wifi network: You can ensure your Chromecast is actively connected to your wifi network from the Google Home app on your iPhone or Android device. Turn your device off and on again: If you're casting from your phone or tablet, power it off completely, then turn it back on again. Turn your Chromecast off and on again: If your device boots back up but the Cast button is still missing, power off and unplug your Chromecast for at least 15 seconds before turning it back on again. Sign out of Netflix: Log out of Netflix on the device you're trying to cast from. Turn off Chrome extensions: If you're using Chrome on a Mac or PC for casting, Netflix recommends turning off your browser extensions. (This seems like an extreme step in my opinion, especially if you're someone who relies on Chrome extension—but if it works, it works.)    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

By choosing to engage with the digital world, you often must give up your anonymity: trackers watch your every move as your surf the web and scroll on social media sites, and they use that information to build profiles of who (and where) you are and deliver you more \"relevant\" ads.It doesn't have to be this way. There are a number of tactics that can help keep your browsing private. You can use a VPN to make it look like your internet activity is coming from somewhere else; if you use Safari, you can take advantage of Private Relay to hide your IP address from websites you visit; or, you can connect the internet across a different network altogether: Tor.What is Tor?The whole idea behind Tor (which is short for The Onion Router) is to anonymize your internet browsing so that no one can tell that it is you visiting any particular website. Tor started out as a project of the U.S. Naval Research Lab in the 1990s, but developed into a nonprofit organization in 2006. Ever since, the network has been popular with users who want to privatize their web activity, whether they're citizens of countries with strict censorship laws, journalists working on sensitive stories, or simply privacy-focused individuals.\nTor is a network, but it's commonly conflated with the project's official browser, also known as Tor. The Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox that connects to the Tor network. The browser removes many of the technical barriers to entry for the Tor network: You can still visit your desired URLs as you would in Chrome or Edge, but the browser will connect you to them automatically via the Tor network automatically. But what does that mean?How does Tor work?Traditionally, when you visit a website, your data is sent directly to that site, complete with your identifying information (i.e. your device's IP address). That website, your internet service provider, and any other entities that might be privy to your internet traffic can all see that it is your device making the request, and can collect that information accordingly. This can be as innocent as the website in question storing your details for your next visit, or as scummy as the site following you around the internet.Tor flips the script on this internet browsing model. Rather than connect your device directly to the website you're visiting, Tor runs your connection through a number of different servers, known as \"nodes.\" These nodes are hosted by volunteers all over the world, so there's no telling which nodes your request will go through when you initiate a connection.But Tor would not be known for its privacy if it only relied on multiple nodes to bounce your traffic around. In addition to the nodes, Tor adds layers of encryption your request. When the request passes from one node to another, each node is only able to decrypt one layer of the encryption, just enough to learn where to send the next request to. This method ensures that no one node in the system knows too much: Each only knows where the request came from one step before, and where it is sending the request to in the following step. It's like peeling back layers of an onion, hence the platform's name. Here's a simplified example of how it works: Let's say you want to visit Lifehacker.com through Tor. You initiate the request as you normally would, by typing the URL into Tor's address bar and hitting enter. When you do, Tor adds layered encryption to your request. The first node it sends it to, perhaps based in, say, the U.S., can unlock one layer of that encryption, which tells the node which node to send it to next. The next node, based perhaps in Japan, decrypts another layer of that encryption, which tells it to send it to a third node in Germany. That third node (known as the exit node) decrypts the final layer of encryption, which tells the node to connect to Lifehacker.com. Once Lifehacker receives the request, the reverse happens: Lifehacker sends the request to the node in Germany, which adds back its layer of encryption. It then sends it back to the node in Japan, which adds a second layer of encryption. It sends it back to the node in the U.S., which adds the final layer of encryption, before sending the fully encrypted request back to your browser, which can decrypt the entire request on your behalf. Congratulations: You have just visited Lifehacker.com, without revealing your identity. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTor isn't perfect for privacyWhile Tor goes a long way to anonymizing your internet activity, it won't protect you entirely. One of the network's biggest weaknesses is in the exit node: Since the final node in the chain carries the decrypted request, it can see where you're going, and, potentially, what you're doing when you get there. It won't be able to know where the request originated, but it can see that you're trying to access Lifehacker. Depending on what sites you're accessing, you might give enough information away to reveal yourself.  This was especially an issue when websites were largely using the unencrypted HTTP protocol. If you connected to an unencrypted website, that final node might be able to see your activity on the site itself, including login information, messages, or financial data. But now that most sites have switched to the encrypted HTTPS protocol, there's less concern with third-parties being able to access the contents of your traffic. Still, even if trackers can't see exactly what you're doing or saying on these sites, they can see you visited the site itself, which is why Tor is still useful in today's encrypted internet.  Who should use Tor?If you've heard anything about Tor, you might know it as the go-to service for accessing the dark web. That is true, but that doesn't make Tor bad. The dark web is not inherently bad, either: It's simply a network of sites that cannot be accessed by standard web browsers. That includes a number of very bad sites filled with very bad stuff, to be sure. But it also encompasses a number of perfectly legal activities as well. Chrome or Firefox cannot see dark web sites, but Tor browser can. But you don't need to visit the dark web in order for Tor to be useful. Anyone who wants to keep their internet traffic private from the world can benefit. You might have a serious need for this, such as if you live in a country that won't let you access certain websites, or if you're a reporter working on a story that could have ramifications should the information leak. But you don't need to have a specialized case to benefit. Tor can help reduce anyone's digital footprint, and keep trackers from following you around the internet.One big drawbackIf you do decide to use Tor, understand that it won't be as fast as other modern browsers. Running your traffic through multiple international nodes takes a toll on performance, so you may be waiting a bit longer for your websites to load than you're used to. However, it won't cost you anything to try it, as the browser is completely free to download and use on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Android. (Sorry, iOS fans.) If you're worried about what you've heard about the dark web, don't be: The only way to access that material it is to seek it out directly. Otherwise, using Tor will feel just like using any other browser—albeit just a tad slower. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Simply called YouTube Recap, this feature will break down your watching habits across all categories in 2025.According to YouTube, YouTube Recap will show \"a set of up to 12 different cards,\" with spotlights on \"your top channels, interests, and even the evolution of your viewing habits.\" It'll draw its data from both long-form and short-form videos as well as downloaded videos, but it'll only track videos you watched while signed in to your account.The company is also dividing its viewers into \"personality types\" based on what they watch, such as \"the Trailblazer\" or \"the Skill Builder.\" There's a whole breakdown of what these mean over on a support page, but as an example, if you're a \"Sunshiner,\" that means \"You're drawn to content that spreads positivity and good vibes.\" Google says that the most common personality types this year were \"the Sunshiner,\" \"the Wonder Seeker,\" and \"the Connector,\" and that personalities like \"the Philosopher\" and \"the Dreamer\" were more rare. So I guess you can brag about that if you get one of those.\nIf you listen to a lot of music on YouTube, meanwhile, YouTube Recap will also pull some data from YouTube Music, and can show you your top artists and songs of the year. For more detail, you'll need to visit the YouTube Music app and look at your YouTube Music recap proper.YouTube Recap should be available in North America starting today, although it might take some time until you see it—I can't seem to access mine yet. For global viewers, YouTube says it will \"roll out to the rest of the world this week.\" You'll be able to view it in 17 languages, with a full list available here.I'll keep checking for mine throughout the day, but for now, here's how to find your YouTube Recap once it goes live.How to view your YouTube RecapAccording to YouTube's instructions, YouTube Recap is available on both desktop and in the mobile app, and will show up as a banner either on your homepage or in your \"You\" tab. \nOn mobile, you can get to your \"You\" tab by tapping the button in the bottom-right corner with your profile picture on it, while on desktop, you'll need to click the \"You\" subheading in the pane on the left-hand side of your screen. Or, you can just navigate to youtube.com/recap and let your browser do the work for you (if on mobile, it'll direct you to the appropriate section of the app). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNote that you'll need to be signed in for any of this to work. You might also need to update your YouTube app if you're still having trouble. Google says you need version 18.43 or newer to see your Recap.Once you've viewed your recap, you'll also be able to share it, by tapping or clicking the Share button in any of your recap cards. Or, you can save it by tapping the download button to the left of the Share button.YouTube's most popular topics and creators in 2025\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: YouTube\n                    \n    \nAlongside YouTube Recap, YouTube has also released a more general look at trending topics, creators, and songs in 2025. The most popular topic in 2025 was apparently Squid Game, while MrBeast was the top creator (I have a feeling those might be connected). The Joe Rogan Experience is at the top of the podcast list, and interestingly, there are separate trending lists for shorts and full-length videos, with Forrest Frank's YOUR WAY'S BETTER topping Shorts and Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With a Smile taking the crown for full-length videos. KPop Demon Hunters is the only topic where you'll see overlap between the Shorts and full-length lists, with Soda Pop appearing on both.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've always enjoyed keeping useful menu bar apps there, such as clipboard managers, app launchers, or apps that update other apps. But unfortunately, if you've installed more than a few third-party apps on your MacBook, your menu bar might be pretty cluttered. It's nothing a quick clean-up can't fix, though, and now macOS ships with a few ways to help fix your messy menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nJust as you'd remove unwanted items from your desk, you should periodically declutter the menu bar by removing apps that don't need to be there. This doesn't uninstall those apps, but it does free up some space in your menu bar. I do this for menu bar icons I never end up clicking. macOS 26 Tahoe has an easy way to remove apps from the menu bar. Follow these steps to do it:Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen.Go to System Settings > Menu Bar.In the right pane, navigate to the section called Allow in the Menu Bar.You'll see a list of apps that have a menu bar icon. You can uncheck any app you want to remove.Some apps also offer a way to remove their icons from the menu bar. Try checking your apps' settings to see if they let you remove their menu bar icons.\nNote that removing a menu bar icon for an app can sometimes cause the app to become \"headless,\" which means that it'll be running in the background but its icon won't show up in either the menu bar or the dock. This is fine for apps that you only need to configure once, but it can become a problem if you want to use the app regularly. In such cases, you can use a Spotlight search (Cmd + Space, or the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar) or alternatives such as Alfred or Raycast to search for the app's name and open it.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm sure you've noticed that the menu bar has more than just app icons. It's also home to the clock, wifi, volume controls, and more. You can easily add or remove these controls from the menu bar, as long as you're running macOS Tahoe. Here's how:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGo to System Settings > Menu Bar.Head over to the Menu Bar Controls section.Uncheck any control you want to remove from the menu bar.You cannot entirely remove the clock from the menu bar, but you can click Clock Options… and switch to Analog to make its icon a lot smaller.Drag and drop icons to rearrange the menu bar\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou also have the option of dragging and dropping your app icons around the menu bar, or using drag-and-drop to remove them from the menu bar. Just hold the Command key and drag any menu bar icon to a different position within the menu bar to rearrange it. To remove icons from the menu bar using drag-and-drop, hold Command and drag-and-drop them outside the menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTo tame the chaos at the top of your Mac's screen, I strongly recommend using a menu bar manager app. These apps will automatically show or hide menu bar icons based on triggers (eg: the battery icon will only show up when your MacBook's charge is below 25%), or add a second row of icons that's visible only when you click the menu bar. You'll need to try a couple of menu bar managers to decide which one works best for you.

The concept of unfolding a smartphone to reveal a tablet-sized display was simply too cool to be possible. Of course, not only are foldables a reality today, there are a number of models out there to choose from. Samsung released its first Galaxy Z Fold back in 2019, and while the foldable market isn't nearly as hot as traditional smartphones, they are very much an option for anyone who isn't afraid of the inflated MSRP.   On Monday, Samsung unveiled its latest foldable smartphone: the Galaxy Z TriFold. Unlike the Z Fold, however, this new device doesn't have two displays: It has three. The appropriately named TriFold unfolds twice to reveal \"one\" large 10-inch display. That's an additional two inches when compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 7's unfolded display size. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nSamsung claims when the TriFold is fully open, it performs on par to three 6.5-inch smartphones lined up in a row. The company has some examples of how you can take advantage of that screen real estate: You could have three windows open at once, all the same uniform design; two windows, one smaller and one larger; or one huge window with multiple on-screen elements of its own. You can also watch videos on platforms like YouTube while reading comments at the same time. \nPlus, the TriFold acts as its own Samsung DeX workstation. You can treat it like a small personal computer, saving up to four workspaces that can each run five apps at once. That means you can switch between as many as 20 apps all running at the same time, across four preset workspaces. You can also connect the TriFold to an external monitor, plus pair the foldable with a mouse and keyboard for a more traditional computing experience.  TriFold Samsung says the TriFold uses a \"refined\" version of its Armor FlexHinge to support the new triad displays. It uses two hinges of different sizes to stabilize folding and to reduce the gap between them, and adds a thin piece of metal to protect the folding mechanism. The design prevents the displays from actually touching each other when closed, which should reduce the chance of cracks or damage.Galaxy Z TriFold specsWhile we haven't seen much of the phone in action yet, we do have the device's on-paper specs. Here's what you can expect:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMain screen: 2160 x 1584 10-inch AMOLED, 120 Hz refresh rate, 1600 nits of peak brightnessCover screen: 2520 x 1080 6.5-inch AMOLED, 120 Hz refresh rate, 2600 nits of peak brightnessDimensions: 159.2 x 75.0 x 12.9 mm (folded); 159.2 x 214.1 x 3.9 mm (unfolded) Weight: 309gProcessor: Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for GalaxyRear cameras: 12MP, Dual Pixel AF, F2.2 (Ultra-wide); 200MP Quad Pixel AF, optical image stabilization (OIS), F1.7, 2x optical zoom (Wide); 10MP, OIS, F2.4, 3x optical zoom, 30x digital zoom (Tele)Front cameras: 10MP selfie camera, F2.2 (cover screen); 10MP main camera, F2.2 (main screen)Memory and storage: 16GB RAM, with either 512GB or 1TB of internal storageBattery: 5,600 mAhCharging: Super-Fast Charging 2.0 (45W); Wired charging up to 50% in 30 minutes (45W); Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 (15W)Water resistance: IP48Network and connectivity: 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4  When is the Galaxy Z TriFold available?Again, this isn't a concept or prototype: The TriFold is just about ready for launch. Customers in South Korea are the first to get a chance to try the TriFold, as Samsung is planning on a Dec. 12 release.This is the only firm release date that Samsung currently has for the TriFold, but that doesn't mean the rest of the world is in the dark. Samsung says users in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the UAE will have access shortly after that Dec. 12 release, while those of us in the U.S. will have our shot in the first quarter of 2026.Release dates can change, but if Samsung sticks to this plan, we should be able to check out the TriFold here by the end of March. We don't know the U.S. price at this time, but we do know the Korean price: KRW 3,590,400. That converts to just shy of $2,450. For reference, the Z Fold 7 lists for $1,999.99. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In the past, I've hyped up the beloved Dyson Airwrap, but recently, I've actually been using the Shark FlexStyle instead. Forget the Dyson hype—this thing is fantastic, and right now, it's also a lot cheaper. The Shark FlexStyle is still on sale for Cyber Week, knocked down to $200 from the usual $350. If you're looking for a tool that can do it all but you don't have an unlimited budget, this might be the one for you, and it won't even feel like a compromise. The Shark FlexStyle is a steal right nowRight now, you can get the FlexStyle, which is essentially a large wand that shoots air out of five different attachments, for $199.99 instead of $349.99, its lowest price ever according to price trackers. For comparison, the base model of Dyson's Airwrap is also on sale—for $500. In short, this is the best deal you're going to get on an airstyler, and this one is also perfectly comparable to pricier models and brands.\nHere's what you get with the FlexStyle: Two 1.25\" curling barrels (one clockwise and the other counterclockwise); an oval brush attachment; a paddle brush attachment; and, a hair dryer attachment. It also has four heat and three airflow settings, plus a unique feature that allows you to rotate the top half, so the device forms a right angle (like a traditional blow dryer) or remains straight (like a standard curling iron). Why I love the FlexStyle (even compared to my Dyson)A few weeks ago, my Airwrap went on the fritz. I haven't had a chance to bring it in to be serviced yet, but it's four years old and was already a refurbished model when I got it, so its time may have come. The thing about this machine is that its time seems to come frequently: At Thanksgiving, I was bemoaning my Airwrap's fate and two other women at the table piped up to say they're dealing with the same thing—theirs too just aren't functioning properly anymore. Given the top-of-the-line version is $750, replacing mine wasn't in the cards.Instead, I decided to give the FlexStyle a shot, and it has been at work in my apartment for the past week. Surprisingly, I found it works exactly like my Airwrap, save for a few key differences. First, it's more powerful than my four-year-old Dyson, though to be fair I can't exactly compare it to a brand-new model. Second, the rotating head make the process of drying my hair a lot faster—the first night, I did standard ringlet curls with the 1.25\" barrels but did not set them, hoping to see how they held up all on their own. They maintained their original shape for about a day, which is more mileage than I was getting out of my Airwrap and better than I expected for curls I did not set. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nSince then, I've tested the different attachments. I used the round brush for a traditional blowout that stayed frizz-free for over a day (granted, with help from products like Color Wow and K18), and I curled the ends of my hair under with the barrels and then set them for hold and volume. This is where I was truly impressed: The swiveling top made that style significantly easier to achieve than I'm used to with the Dyson. I am happily on day two of that style, with no issues to report. A cheaper but worthy Dyson alternativeIn my opinion, you do not need to pay $750 for an airstyler. You do not even need to pay $500. And with the current deal on the FlexStyle, you do not even need to pay $350. This thing works well, produces styles that can last (though you still have to use products and set the curls, since it's not running on magic and wishes), and is lightweight and simple to use. Consider it highly recommended. What stores have the best sales on Cyber Week?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Week shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through and beyond Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Week deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Week still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Week deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It has the same polished design and high-quality build Samsung brings to its flagship phones, with a sturdy Armor Aluminum frame, water and dust resistance (IP68), and a bright 11-inch Dynamic AMOLED display that’s crisp, color-rich, and plenty bright even outdoors. It also comes with the redesigned S Pen included at no extra charge, unlike the Apple Pencil.In terms of performance, the Tab S11 holds its own. It’s powered by MediaTek’s 9400+ chip with 12GB RAM and Android 16, which keeps things snappy across multitasking and Samsung’s DeX mode (basically a desktop experience on a tablet). You get 256GB of onboard storage, expandable up to 2TB with a microSD card, which is handy for offline media or large files. Battery life clocked in around 9.5 hours in PCMag’s rundown test, which means real-world use lands somewhere in the all-day range unless you keep brightness maxed out. As for the audio, the stereo speakers are loud and clear enough for small rooms, but the bass is underwhelming—if audio quality matters to you, a solid pair of wireless headphones or earbuds might be a better bet.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCamera-wise, the 13MP rear camera and 12MP front cam handle video calls and quick snapshots fine, but don’t expect smartphone-level sharpness or dynamic range. The real edge lies in the software: Samsung’s One UI 8.0 and Galaxy AI tools like Notes Assist, Transcript Assist, and Circle to Search help streamline everyday use.

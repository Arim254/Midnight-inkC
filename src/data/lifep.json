But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Naturally, scammers are using this model to collect your personal data and promising huge rewards that never materialize. According to a report from Malwarebytes Labs, bad actors are luring users into taking surveys through malvertising ads claiming you've won a Walmart voucher for hundreds of dollars. All you have to do is answer a few questions—easy enough—but you're actually handing over information that can be used to target you even further. Surveys promising big rewards are a scamThese scams start with malvertising (malicious advertising) like website pop-ups and banners, spam emails, and social media ads stating that you've been selected to receive a \"free\" gift card worth hundreds of dollars. The fake ads use official logos from recognizable brands, which build trust, along with countdown timers, which promote urgency. You may think you've gotten lucky, and all you have to do is take a short survey to earn a big payout. When you click through, though, you're redirected to a fake rewards page, which may also look credible thanks to stolen branding. You'll be prompted to provide personal information, such as your name, phone number, email, and address, as well as indicate interest in topics like home repair and insurance. You may be redirected again based on your answers—to a spoofed home improvement site for FindMyWindowPro or Renewal By Anderson, for example—where you're prompted to provide even more data. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis endless loop of surveys doesn't end with a gift card payout, and along the way, you've handed scammers a lot of information that can be sold and used to target you with much more personalized scams in the future based on interests you've handed them. Survey scams may seem like simply a waste of time rather than a real threat, since you don't lose any money right away. But you may see more spam calls and believable phishing emails as a result. Avoid fake survey scamsLike all scams, this one plays on emotion: notably, the excitement of getting lucky and winning big. You're lured in with a sense of urgency and the illusion of low effort. Scammers also use real branding to make the scheme seem more credible. As always, these elements should raise suspicion. Retailers are almost never offering promotions that are too good to be true, and you should never provide personal information in exchange for a \"free\" prize. If you do click through one of these ads, look carefully at the URL, which is almost certainly not the retailer's official domain. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to actually get paid for taking surveysYou can get paid to take surveys or test apps and games, though you certainly won't earn the hundreds of dollars promised in survey scams. The pay is low for the time invested (in most cases, a few dollars per hour) and some survey platforms require you to hit a minimum amount earned to request a payout. You typically have to engage consistently and across multiple platforms to make it worthwhile. NerdWallet compiled a list of popular survey-for-money apps, including Make Money, Eureka, InboxDollars Surveys, Google Opinion Rewards, and Swagbucks. Reddit users also suggest Survey Junkie and Branded Surveys. Prolific is a relatively high-paying platform, though you have to join a waitlist to gain access. Of course, you should know that even legitimate survey sites collect a lot of personal information, such as your birth date, zip code, phone number, and health history. All of this may be sold to data brokers, and there's always a risk of a data breach that could lead to identity theft. Be sure to weigh the risks and rewards of signing up for these platforms. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

On Wednesday, the company announced the latest versions of GPT, the model that power ChatGPT: GPT-5.1 Instant, and GPT-5.1 Thinking. OpenAI says Instant is the company's most-used model, but is \"now warmer, more intelligent, and better at following your instructions.\" Thinking, on the other hand, is the company's reasoning model, and is both faster and \"easier to understand\" with simple tasks, as well as more \"persistent\" on complex requests.It seems like mostly minor updates to me, but here's what's new, according to OpenAI:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGPT-5.1 InstantLet's take a look at Instant first. OpenAI claims the model is \"surprisingly\" playful. For the prompt \"I'm feeling stressed and could use some relaxation tips,\" OpenAI shows two sample answers for GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 Instant, respectively: GPT-5: \"Here are a few simple, effective ways to help ease stress — you can mix and match depending on how you’re feeling and how much time you have.\"  GPT-5.1 Instant: \"I’ve got you, Ron — that’s totally normal, especially with everything you’ve got going on lately. Here are a few ways to decompress depending on what kind of stress you’re feeling.\"I can see the differences, of course: GPT-5 is a bit more serious in tone, while 5.1 offers that classic AI overly friendly approach, and makes sure to include the user's name. How human. But scrolling through the rest of the comparison, I'm not so sure I see a huge difference. Both break down their various suggestions into bullet points, though 5.1 occasionally includes more flowery language like \"bonus points.\"Another change OpenAI touts is improved instruction following. The presented examples show the user prompting the bot with the request \"Always respond with six words.\" GPT-5 follow suit for its first response, but when asked where the user should travel to this summer, the bot completely ignores the six-word answer mandate, and offers a full response instead. GPT-5.1, on the other hand, keeps up the bit throughout the exchange, regardless of how complex the questions become. I get that it's just an example, but why would someone need their bot to follow such an odd request? I suppose it implies that GPT-5.1 will maintain your original instructions throughout an interaction, but if so, why not show an application where that's actually useful? I'd rather receive a fuller answer to important questions than have all responses be exactly six words.  Finally, OpenAI says that Instant can still tap into reasoning models when appropriate, while still generating quick results. The company doesn't get into it much, but they must have tweaked something in the algorithm that lets the model \"think\" over complex suggestions, without going so deep that the response takes too long.  GPT-5.1 ThinkingGPT-5.1 Thinking is a direct upgrade to the existing GPT-5 Thinking model. Like GPT-5.1 Instant, OpenAI says the model can adjust its processing according to the task at hand. In theory, that means 5.1 Thinking can respond to simpler prompts more quickly, while taking more time \"thinking\" through complicated tasks. OpenAI claims that GPT-5.1 Thinking is about twice as fast when responding to the \"fastest tasks\" and twice as slow on the \"slowest tasks\" when compared to GPT-5, when both models are set to Standard.OpenAI says 5.1 Thinking uses less specialized language, and doesn't necessarily assume you understand complex terms. The company shows an example of someone asking the bot to explain BABIP and and wRC+ (Batting Average on Balls in Play and Weighted Runs Created Plus, respectively). GPT-5's explanation includes abbreviations, formulas, and insider concepts that I certainly wouldn't pick up as someone who knows next to nothing about baseball. The 5.1 Thinking result, on the other hand, spells out those abbreviations, walks the user through the formulas instead of simply displaying them, and goes into more detail about certain complex topics. I can see how that would offer some improvements in clarity, even though you always need to watch out for hallucinations. Sure, it's great to make responses more clear, but that won't help if the responses themselves are completely inaccurate.Adjusting ChatGPT's tone\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nAs part of these new models, OpenAI is changing the way you customize ChatGPT's tone and style. The new Personalization options include the usual \"Default\" tone, but \"Listener\" is now called \"Friendly,\" while \"Robot\" is now \"Efficient.\" (Perhaps GPT took offense to the latter.) OpenAI says these options all have updates, but doesn't specify what those are. In addition, you have new options to choose from as well. These include \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); and \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLastly, the company says it is currently testing a new settings option that lets you fine-tune the tone and style of the bot to your liking, but is launching the experiment with a limited pool of users only. What else is newOpenAI says that by default, you won't need to choose between these two models: GPT-5.1 Auto will decide which model makes sense for you based on your query. That's been the case since the company launched GPT-5, though paid subscribers can still manually choose their model. Speaking of paid subscribers, GPT-5.1 is rolling out first to Pro, Plus, Go, and Business users. The company started shipping the model on Wednesday, and says it will gradually appear over the next few days. The model will arrive to free and logged-out users soon, though there's no specific timeline yet. Paid subscribers will also have access to GPT-5 for three months, as OpenAI takes it time winding down the older model. The company likely doesn't want to repeat the issues caused when it immediately removed models like GPT-4o and older from ChatGPT, as users who were quite literally attached to the model were upset to lose it. OpenAI is careful to note that GPT-5's sunsetting period has no impact on existing legacy models like 4o, which are still available for the time being. For a new update to GPT, this really isn't all that flashy. Maybe that's a good thing: OpenAI overhyped GPT-5, which was a let down for many fans of GPT-4o—especially when the company subsequently took that model away. Keeping expectations in check for GPT-5.1 is likely a smart move, but I can't help but wonder if it's a sign that AI advancements are starting to slow down. We know AI companies are running out of data to train their models on, we just don't know how soon the impacts will be felt. GPT-5.1 probably isn't a harbinger of doom for OpenAI, but it is interesting that it isn't an exponential improvement, either.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

From roof leaks to burst pipes—water damage is the second-most claimed loss on home insurance policies, just below “wind and hail.” In fact, there are way more losses due to water damage than fire.And the most troubling aspect of water damage is how silent it can be. You can have a leak for a long time before the damage becomes bad enough to notice. And even if you know you have a water leak somewhere, locating it can often be difficult because water can travel a long way from the source before making its presence known. That’s why you need these five kinds of leak detectors on hand, so you’ll know when a damaging water leak erupts, and be able to find it quickly to minimize the damage.Moisture alarmsStep one is to have water detectors with alarms set up around the house in places where leaks are probable. These alarms are typically wifi-connected and simply detect moisture beyond a normal level, ringing out an audible alarm and sending a message to your devices warning you of a leak. Having them placed in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, basements, attics, and anywhere else where the home comes into contact with water means leaks will be noticed right away instead of slowly destroying your property over weeks, months, or even years.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThese alarms can often be combined with networked shutoff valves that will automatically turn off the water supply when a leak is detected. That way, even if you’re not home, the damage from a leak will be minimized.Moisture meterAs useful as leak alarms are, they can only help if present where a water leak occurs—and they only tell you that there’s water, not where the water is coming from. Sometimes the source will be obvious, of course—if the alarm placed near your toilet goes off, chances are good that it’s your toilet doing the leaking. But if the leak begins with a pipe in your wall, one tiny spot on a large roof system, or underground, you’ll need some help locating it.A moisture meter is a must-have for finding leaks. It’s a simple device that measures the amount of moisture trapped in a material, like drywall or flooring. By taking multiple readings throughout an area, you can pinpoint where the water is concentrated before you start tearing things open to effect a repair, saving you time and money.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEndoscopesSometimes you need to see inside the spaces and voids of your home to find a water leak. If you suspect a pipe is leaking in the walls, for example, and you’re getting some confusing moisture meter readings, it might be time to reach for one of the most useful tools you’ll ever own: an endoscopic camera (aka, a borescope). This is a small, flexible camera that can be inserted into a small space and fished around, allowing you to see what’s behind a wall, under a floor, or inside a soffit in your home without ripping everything open. If there’s no obvious way to insert the camera, you can usually drill a small access hole that can be easily repaired later, and the video feed will let you inspect all those pipes to see where the water’s coming from.Pipe locatorA pipe locator is exactly what it sounds like: It locates the hidden pipes feeding water into and taking water out of your house, which are often inside walls, under floors, or buried underground. If you’re trying to figure out where a leaking pipe might be located, this tool can be invaluable, especially if other options haven’t worked.They’re not cheap—this one from Rigid is one of the more affordable options, and it’s about $1,800 at the time of this writing. But you can easily spend $1,000 or more if a plumber comes out to locate and fix your leaking pipe, so if you’re comfortable fixing the leak yourself, a tool like this will pay for itself eventually because you’ll be able to isolate the leak, turn off water to just that area, and effect the repair.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n            Features editor\n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

On the one hand, these features have the potential to make shopping more convenient—on the other hand, maybe lowering friction isn't the best idea when it comes to spending money. Beyond selling you on convenience, these features all share something else in common—helping businesses up their clickthrough rates.It starts with AI Mode and Gemini, which can now access all the same information as Google Search's shopping tab. That means you'll start to see product cards alongside your AI answers, which you can click on for a bunch of shopping links, or hit a checkmark to compare the selected products. They won't show up on every question, but on about half of the prompts I tried, I got the option to spend money right away.Then, if you're still not sure you want to buy yet, now you can have Google's AI robocall local businesses for you to check on product availability and pricing, as well as any deals or bundles you might not know about. There are a few caveats—businesses can opt out, and Google will avoid calling them at odd hours or too frequently—but the idea is that if you're on the fence, you can have an AI help you know which stores to go to.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFinally, when it comes time to actually purchase whatever you're shopping for, you can have Google's AI check out for you. This feature is an extension of the existing price tracking feature, and will add a \"Buy for me\" button to any price tracking notifications you get from certain participating stores, like Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, or certain Shopify merchants. You'll get a link to the product you'd be buying from your notification, and the price will be pulled from that, so the company says you won't have to worry about the AI getting the price wrong. Instead, it's just supposed to remove any hesitation you might feel from having to enter your shipping or payment details into a checkout form.I won't deny that, when holiday shopping, I usually won't turn down assistance. But a continued refrain I had while hearing about these new features was \"Why?\"Personally, I'm mortified at the idea of sending employees at local businesses robocalls to deal with. And if I'm researching products, while it might be helpful to be able to involve an AI so I could ask specific question, I think I'd still prefer full access to all the filters and hundreds of links available in Google Shopping. The big thing for me, though, is agentic checkout. While I'm actually willing to trust Google that it won't make mistakes (and you do get a reference ID to hand to support in case it does), I'm also not sure why I'd want to go right from getting a price drop notification to having an AI spend money for me. It doesn't take long to fill out a checkout form, and while Google Shopping is a useful price tracking tool, it's not the only one around. I'd probably want to comparison shop a bit more before committing, at which point I might as well fill out the checkout form myself. But if you think about these features from the perspective of a business, the \"why\" behind all of this suddenly becomes a lot clearer. Turning people browsing web listings into actual paying customers has been a problem for about as long as the internet has existed, and all of these features introduce new opportunities for impulse purchases at every step of the buying process, while also erasing the opportunity for users to get caught up on a larger selection of options.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's not a conspiracy. Google charges companies for sponsored slots and ads, and the more people that buy products using a Google service, the more companies will want to pay for those. And for what it's worth, Lifehacker makes money on affiliate links. I won't deny that companies needs money, and that people need to buy gifts.What this does do, however, is reduce the friction that might pop up in between having an idle thought to buy something, and opening your wallet. While it plays at being a research buddy, it takes control out of your hands, obfuscates sources and other options, and instead encourages you to spend your money as quickly as possible, while discouraging skepticism.As someone who writes reviews and best-of lists, I like to think that my readers are a bit more savvy than that. Convenience is great, but taking the extra few minutes it takes to find an actual human opinion from someone who's used the product, or to double check that the price Google is serving you is really your best option, could save you from hours of pain down the line.Like most AI tools, there's potential here. But as much as AI will try to convince you that it's just some neutral buddy, remember that there are business motivations behind everything the companies behind these chatbots do. Keeping your whole shopping search in the same ecosystem as a company that's main profit still comes from ads and e-commerce probably isn't the best way to get your information.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Some phones are better than others, especially when paired with battery-saving settings, but in general, it's a universal anxiety to feel like your phone might die before you reach a charger again. There are many reasons your smartphone's battery might drain fast, but some of the likeliest culprits are poorly-designed apps. Some of these programs use too much processing power when you're actively using them, while others needlessly run in the background. You can always check your device's battery stats to see which apps are the worst offenders, but what if you know know an app was a battery anchor before downloading it in the first place?The Play Store's new battery warningsAs of March 1, 2026, that will be the new reality. In just a few months, when you tap on an app in the Play Store, you might see a new alert that wasn't there before. Underneath the usual details, like the app's name, developer, reviews, and rating, you'll see a red warning, stating something to the effect of, \"This app may use more battery than expected due to high background activity.\" I don't know about you, but that would get me thinking twice about downloading it. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccording to the Android Developer Blog, this has been in the works for some time. In partnership with Samsung, the company rolled out a new metric in beta earlier this year called \"excessive partial wake locks,\" which aimed to reveal to developers when their apps \"excessively\" wake the display. Following this beta program, Google says it refined the algorithm it uses to calculate this rating, and has now rolled out the metric to all developers. Going forward, if an app wakes the screen for a total of two hours in any given 24 hour period, Google will note it as excessive. If 5% of an app's user sessions are excessive over a 28 day period, it crosses the \"bad behavior threshold.\" This can result in a number of different consequences for the app: Google may first pull it from discovery surfaces in the Play Store. That could seriously impact an app's total installs, as users won't find it without searching for the app directly. Of course, Google may also affix the app's Play Store page with the aforementioned battery alert, which will also discourage users from downloading it. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe onus is now on app developers to correct this \"bad behavior\" in their apps by March of next year. Hopefully, any battery hogs on your smartphone will be fixed in the next few months, but if not, keep an eye on their Play Store pages. If you see this alert, you might want to uninstall the app entirely. This isn't the first time the Play Store rolled out a feature to root out bad apps. Last year, the marketplace launched live threat detection to highlight apps that might be spreading malware. The Play Store has also tested alerts that would warn you about apps that are frequently uninstalled, or that have a significantly lower active user count than competitor apps.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The new feature is powered by Google's \"Shopping Graph,\" a list of 50 billion products that also informs Google's Shopping tab, and it's available to everyone on both desktop and mobile starting today.Here's how it works: In Google search's AI Mode or the Gemini app/website, you can ask a question or send a prompt about a physical product, like \"Help me find an espresso maker that has a steam wand, is affordable, and is good for beginners.\" If the AI can find relevant product information in the Shopping Graph, it'll then give you a short writeup and pop up a few product suggestions along with shopping information, like pricing and user reviews. Clicking on any of these tiles will then open a sidebar with sites where you can purchase the item.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nEssentially, it's like using Google's Shopping tab, but with a virtual shopping assistant (or, let's be real, a salesperson) you can turn to for more context about what you're seeing. Some queries will even let you click a checkbox on their product tiles so you can mark off to ask follow-up questions. For instance, you could check off two product tiles and ask the AI to compare them, or ask which is cheaper or has better reviews.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccording to Google representatives at a press event, the company is hoping this will make it easier for shoppers to buy gifts for friends or relatives that are traditionally hard to shop for, and that it will make shopping easier by letting people search using natural language.My hands-on experienceWhen I tested out this new tool, it generally worked out, but I did encounter a few hiccups. The biggest was that it was hard to get the AI to recognize certain products as topics it could surface tiles for. For instance, asking for \"Popular Nintendo Switch games under $60\" just gave me a list of games, but no links to purchase them. I assume this is because the AI thought I was simply asking for general advice about what to play instead of shopping, but no amount of rewording would prompt the tool to show me product tiles, even when I explicitly asked for them.I also ran into problems when it came to natural language searches. At the aforementioned press event, Google gave journalists example questions to ask the AI in order to try the new feature, but I found only the questions that called out specific types of products would give me tiles to click on. For instance, a question like \"Give me Christmas gift ideas for my sister who loves knitting and reading\" wouldn't trigger the new feature, but \"show me ottomans that can be used as coffee tables\" would. Even the example Google used in its blog announcing the feature wouldn't work for me—asking for Christmas gift ideas for a college student who likes to run gave me generic answers like \"running shoes\" and \"moisture-wicking socks,\" but didn't show any specific examples that I could buy.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat shouldn't stop you from getting gift ideas from the AI, but it does mean that when you're ready to buy, you'll want to ask a fresh question that asks for a specific type of product, rather than ideas for a specific person. It's a bit of an extra step for something that's supposed to take the guesswork out of the buying process.With those caveats in place, I still see most users still sticking to the regular shopping tab, where they can be sure they'll get product links every time. But Google's hoping that integrating shopping into AI Mode will eventually give users the best of both worlds, allowing them to make more specific searches than they could without AI, and also allowing the AI to call on training data the shopping tab doesn't have access to, like Reddit posts and website reviews.Now I just need to find a way to convince my family that all my thoughtful gift ideas didn't just come from a robot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It’s in your Gmail, it’s on your phone, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now rolling out to everyone—and getting a bunch of new features, too.If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select Gemini in Chrome to turn it on, assuming you want to.How to use Gemini in ChromeWhen you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAdditionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.More AI browsing is comingGoogle says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first. For now, Gemini in Chrome will start suggesting questions to ask it about whatever page you’re on, right in the address bar.The update includes a few security updates too, although they mostly seem to work in the backend, supposedly using AI to better block scammy ads and notifications. Now that’s the type of AI integration I can support wholeheartedly.How to turn off Gemini in ChromeAll that said, if you’re a bit skeptical about Gemini in Chrome, you can turn it off. Simply navigate to Settings > AI Innovations, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut. You can also restrict its permissions: Set everything to off, and it’ll be like it was never installed in the first place.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nNote, however, that if you're on a managed account, you might not see the menu. That's the case for one of my coworkers, but the solution there is simple. Right-click the Gemini icon and click \"unpin,\" and you won't see it anymore. However, you won't have the same controls over Gemini in Chrome's permissions here as you would when banishing it through the AI Innovations menu. Unpinning the feature will instead simply hide it, so to get rid of it further, you'll need to contact your account manager.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Hell, even when you're alone at your desk, are you locked in on that spreadsheet or graphics project for eight straight hours, or might you be sipping a drink or texting your spouse every once in a while? There are simply some hours that aren’t true work hours, even if they occur during the work day. Times like these are known as idle time or downtime—but there’s a difference between the two, and understanding that can actually help you work smarter and be more productive.The difference between idle time and downtimeThese terms don’t just refer to the time experienced by people in the workplace; they also refer to—and come from—the tools we use to get our jobs done. The terms come from the tech world. Essentially, idle time is any time when an asset is waiting to run or isn’t scheduled to run, and downtime is when the asset can’t run, due to an outage or planned maintenance. For example, idle time happens when you’re waiting for your computer to boot up; downtime happens when the computer just won’t turn on. Outside of tech, idle time happens as you wait for a coworker to formulate a response to a question you asked, but downtime happens when they just don't respond and you're waiting in limbo, unable to work without their answer.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSo, for people, idle time is nonproductive time that occurs when there’s a lack of demand or an unforeseen work stoppage. When you have all the tools you need available to you, but no reason to use them, you’re in idle time. If you’re working on a pitch deck, for instance, and need approval from a higher-up before you move forward on it, you’re idle while you wait for that approval, even though you could open the program to work on it. The reason you don't do that isn't that you don't have the tools; it's that you don't want to waste time doing it wrong.Downtime isn’t necessarily bad. Throughout the day, you need to take breaks from working. In fact, taking regular breaks makes you more productive, but that's more if you intend to take them, instead of having them foisted on you by someone or something else's failure to provide the tools you need. You can run into idle time that is caused by what corporate psychologists call “the dead-time effect,” which is when you’re overworked and stop being productive. In the productivity world, this is known as Illich's Law: The more you work without a break, the less productive you eventually get as the quality of your work declines. It’s better to pre-plan downtime than let idle time occur because of burnout. The trick to making idle and downtime work for you and your company is scheduling.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nScheduling around idle and downtimeDowntime can also occur when too many people are away from the office, say, on vacations or out sick. In that case, unlike idle time, a job can’t just be done whenever everything is ready, as the key tools—in this case, the people—are completely offline. To avoid losses from idle time and downtime, you need a solid scheduling plan. First, you should personally schedule around idle time. For instance, if you work in an environment that depends on the delivery of certain assets or products, pad time into your schedule to account for how long that might take. If it should take one day, leave padding for two, and fill up any idle slots with work you can accomplish without the shipment, if any. Use time boxing and time blocking, or the complete filling of your calendar, for this, and set two deadlines: the ideal date the shipment (or whatever you need) will be there, and a flexible time that you could still make work.For scheduling around downtime, make sure that you update your company-wide calendar whenever you’re going to be out and check for others’ outages when you’re making your personal schedule. Others’ downtime could lead to yours if you don’t account for the things you’ll need from them and get those before they’re gone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

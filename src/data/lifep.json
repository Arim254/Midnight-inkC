It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.In the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time. But that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility. The researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own). The participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios. How a chatbot with “correct” information can lead people astrayAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information. Even if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.  The researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:The users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that. The bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).Responses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room. People varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.Correct answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options. Overall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChatbots are a risk for doctors, tooPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care. ECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”ECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”Even in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns. Clearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results. \n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Beth Skwarecki\n                                    Senior Health Editor\n                                \n                                            Covering health, fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Beth's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Beth\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

This latest \"Patch Tuesday\" fixes 58 vulnerabilities in total, six of which are zero-day flaws. As a reminder, a zero-day is a vulnerability that has been either actively exploited in the wild or publicly disclosed before an official fix is released by the developer. As BleepingComputer reports, security flaws were found in the following categories: 25 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, five security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 12 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, six information disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial of service vulnerabilities, and seven spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities and two of the information disclosure vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" (These numbers do not include the three Microsoft Edge vulnerabilities patched earlier in February.)Patch Tuesday updates are typically released around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of every month, and your device should receive them automatically. BleepingComputer reports that this month's release also includes Secure Boot certificate updates for 2011 certificates that are expiring in June. \nSix zero-days patched in FebruaryThree of the six actively exploited zero-days fixed in February are security feature bypass vulnerabilities: CVE-2026-21510: This is a flaw the Windows Shell that allows an attacker to execute content without warning or gaining user consent, though the user does need to open a malicious link or shortcut file. CVE-2026-21513: This MSHTML Framework vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network. Microsoft has not released details on how this flaw was exploited. CVE-2026-21514: This vulnerability in Microsoft Word allows an attacker to bypasses OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office once a user has opened a malicious Office file. All three of the above flaws have been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), Office Product Group Security Team, and Google Threat Intelligence Group along with an anonymous researcher for CVE-2026-21510 and CVE-2026-21514.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo of the zero-days are elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. CVE-2026-21519 is a Desktop Windows Manager flaw that allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges, while CVE-2026-21533 is a Windows Remote Desktop Services flaw that allows an attacker to elevate privileges locally. The former has been attributed to MSTIC and MSRC, while the latter was discovered by the Advanced Research Team at CrowdStrike.Finally, CVE-2026-21525 is a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager that allows an unauthorized attacker to deny service locally. This flaw was discovered by the ACROS Security team with 0patch—it was reportedly found in a public malware repository in December 2025. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men. Carefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight. Men can have eating disorders, tooBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness. Unfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"Unsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent. We all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.What’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.Unattainable beauty standards stay unattainableBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation.  “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty  regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor. What does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.As a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.The bottom lineThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement? Women have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.\n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

The company announced a number of updates this week, chief among them a new look for its Android and iOS apps—the former is getting a total overhaul, but iPhone users will still note some new UI elements when chatting with friends on Telegram. There are also some new features, including one I find a little odd. There's a new look for Telegram on mobile\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Telegram\n                    \n    \nPer the announcement, the biggest changes come via UI updates, particularly on Android. Telegram says that its Android app has a \"fully redesigned interface\" intended to make navigating the app quicker and more intuitive—Telegram notes the interface code itself was entirely rebuilt to meet these goals. Changes include a new iOS-like bottom bar that lets you switch between your chats, settings, and profile, among other functionality. If you find the new interface effects to be too much, or too big a draw on your battery, Telegram says you can adjust them from Settings > Power Saving. The company also updated its iOS app, though not quite in the same way. Telegram says it added \"even more Liquid Glass\" to its iOS app, Apple's new design language for iOS 26, including a redesigned media viewer, sticker and emoji pack preview panels, and new context menus in profiles when choosing messages.\nYou can now transfer a Telegram group chat to a new admin\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Telegram\n                    \n    \nAs of this latest update, if the owner of a Telegram group chat leaves that conversation, the ownership of the group will transfer automatically to one of the group's admins after a week. However, the departing group owner can also choose their own admin if they want to, as Telegram now presets an option to appoint another admin when leaving the group. The company adds that admins can transfer ownership at any time, even if they don't leave.    Telegram bots are now more colorful\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Telegram\n                    \n    \nA small change, but if you develop bots for Telegram, you now have the option to add colors and emojis to those buttons. It's far from a radical update, but it could make it a bit easier to tell options apart at a glance. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's a new send message shortcut on the Telegram iPad appA small but noteworthy feature for any Telegram users on iPad: Now, you can send a message using the shortcut \"Command + Enter.\"You can now \"craft\" gifts in TelegramAnd here's that weird new feature: I don't usually expect my chat app to offer collectible gifts, but apparently Telegram does. It previously introduced the ability to send gifts to other people, and even upgrade those gifts to collectibles that can be auctioned on NFT marketplaces (which requires real money).Now, Telegram is reportedly expanding this gift system in the latest update with the ability to combine existing gifts in a new \"crafting\" system to create \"Uncommon, Rare, Epic or Legendary\" versions. You can combine up to four gifts at once, and adding multiple gifts with the same \"attributes\" raises the chance the crafted gift will have that attribute as well. Again, this is the last thing I'd expect or want from a chat app, but, as it's part of this update, so I'm telling you about it.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

A new spyware platform known as ZeroDayRAT is reportedly being sold on Telegram, complete with customer support and updates. According to mobile security company iVerify, this aggressive spyware grants full remote control over devices running Android 15 through 16 and iOS versions up to iOS 26. Once deployed, it allows everything from user profiling and location tracking to live surveillance and financial theft. What ZeroDayRAT can gather from your deviceThis spyware has wide-ranging capabilities that, according to iVerify, have traditionally been found on platforms sponsored by state actors. Here's a look at what ZeroDayRAT can do: \nCollect information about the device, such as model, OS, battery, country, lock status, SIM and carrier info, app usage, live activity, and SMS message previews. This allows threat actors to develop user profiles for further targeting.Pull GPS coordinates, capture notifications from apps and systems, and harvest account information, such as usernames and emails. Send SMS messages and receive verification codes to bypass two-factor authentication. Log keystrokes (including biometric unlocks, gestures, and app launches), access the camera and microphone, and screen record.  Log crypto wallet addresses and target banking and payment app credentials via overlay attacks. How to protect against spywareZeroDayRAT can infect your device only if a malicious binary—an APK on Android or iOS payload—is downloaded and installed. These may be distributed through phishing, such as links sent via emails, texts, or messaging platforms, as well as in fake app stores. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll standard guidance for avoiding scams and malware applies: never click links in unsolicited communication, including conversations in apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, and only download apps and extensions from official, trusted sources. Users at high risk of being targeted and anyone who wants an extra layer of security can consider enabling Lockdown Mode (iOS) or Advanced Protection (Android). \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's not hard to move your following list over; you can upload (almost) all of your old tweets if you want; and the scrolling and posting experience is almost identical to what you'll remember from the old days of Twitter. The only feature I've missed? Drafts.Finally, drafts have arrived. In a post to the official Bluesky account, the company announced that it's added drafts to the platform, and that they're rolling out now. To create a draft, just start writing a post, and instead of tapping the Post button, hit Cancel or Drafts instead and choose Save draft. What you've written will be saved as a draft that you can return to later. The feature works for pre-written threads, too (made using the + button on the post screen). To see your saved drafts, open a blank post and hit Drafts before typing anything else. You'll see a list of your stored drafts, and you can either tap on a draft to open it, or hit the three-dots button to the right of the drift and then Discard to delete it.Drafts were a big part of Twitter for me—not just because they helped save posts if my connection dropped in the middle of writing them, but because they also gave me some time to consider if I really wanted to post something before taking it live. It's a handy feature for a platform with such a small character limit, where it might be easy to toss a stray thought out into the ether without really knowing how it might land or if you've expressed yourself as well as you could have. \nI'm not alone, here: A common trend on Twitter was posting screenshots of draft libraries, to give your followers a peak at the half-formed ideas you didn't think were quite ready for prime time. It's a bit of culture I've missed in moving over to the new site, and I'm glad it's now possible once agin.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for where Bluesky could go next, responses to the drafts announcement include requests for more robust DMs or an edit button, although Bluesky staffers have expressed both logistical and ethical concerns with implementing these. In the meantime, there are third-party tools that try to add some of this functionality, but they do come with wonky formatting that an official solution could probably avoid.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Malwarebytes Labs has identified a new scam in which threat actors are using party invites to trick users into installing a remote access tool (RAT) that gives them full control over infected devices. (This specific campaign seems to be limited to the UK, but similar tactics could easily spread.) These malicious invites contain a ScreenConnect installerThe scam starts with an innocuous-looking email invitation with an informal \"Save the Date\" vibe that may appear to come from a friend or acquaintance. The message contains a link to \"View Invitation\" for event details. If you click through, you'll end up on a landing page with a bold \"You're Invited\" header and a button to download your invitation, but you don't actually need to take any further action—your browser automatically triggers the download of a .msi file, which is not actually a party invitation or RSVP form but an installer. The MSI silently installs ScreenConnect Client, a legitimate IT support tool that allows remote access into the user's machine. Once this connection is established, attackers have the ability to see your screen, control your mouse and keyboard, and upload or download files—even if you restart your computer. All of this happens in the background with no obvious indicators that a remote access tool has been installed and is now running, so victims are unlikely to have cause for concern. \nYou should know these remote access red flagsAs Malwarebytes points out, this scheme is successful because it relies on normal human behavior around a seemingly low-risk situation: opening an event invitation. What's unusual is that there's little pressure or urgency in the initial message. Instead, the landing page has language like \"a friend has sent you an invitation\" and \"I opened mine and it was so easy,\" which is a form of social proof that guides users to take the desired action. You should always be alert to unsolicited invites sent via regular email with a link to an external site as well as any communication that prompts you to download or install software. These days, invitations are commonly delivered through apps and digital services like Partiful, Paperless Post, Evite, or Apple Invites, which are generally more trustworthy than random emails with hyperlinked text. If you're unsure whether the invite is real, verify with the sender through another channel before clicking or downloading anything. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs mentioned, victims of this scam may not immediately notice that a RAT has been installed on their device. But there are some red flags, such as unexplained cursor movement or windows opening or closing on their own. You can check your machine for a file named \"RSVPPartyInvitationCard.msi\" or a service called ScreenConnect Client with additional random characters in the title.  If you've already downloaded ScreenConnect from a malicious invite, Malwarebytes recommends disconnecting from the internet and uninstalling the program immediately. Run a security scan to check your device for malware, and change important passwords from a separate device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The carrier announced today that it will soon introduce live translation to all phones connected to its 5G or 4G networks, and to get in on the action, you're going to want to sign up for the beta now.According to a press release sent to journalists today, the new feature will kick in for you automatically once you're selected for it, no matter what phone app or device you use. All you'll need to do to access it is type in \"87\" on the keypad during a phone call. Which means that, yes, it will also be compatible with feature phones, aka classic-style flip phones with physical buttons. The device you use doesn't matter because all of the computing for the translation will happen on T-Mobile's end, rather than on your device. The downside is that you won't get to pick which AI model the translation uses, and T-Mobile hasn't yet to provide any indication of which one it will use. You'll also just have to trust T-Mobile's servers with any audio recorded from your conversation. T-Mobile spokesperson Mason Miller told Lifehacker's sister site PCMag via email that, \"[T-Mobile does] not save call recordings or transcripts,\" but the company will certainly ave to run your data through its servers at some point to make the feature work. By comparison, competing translation apps often rely on downloaded language packs and on-device models.\nStill, I see where T-Mobile is coming from with this offering: When live translation is limited to specific devices or apps, it vastly impacts its usability, since both callers need to have a compatible device for it to work. Processing translation over the cloud makes it more likely you'll be able to use it exactly when you need it—and as a bonus, only one caller will actually need to be on T-Mobile's 5G or 4G network to pull this trick off.While T-Mobile's press release focuses on 5G, the carrier confirmed availability for the feature on 4G to The Verge earlier today. The Verge also reports that, in addition to dialing 87, beta participants will eventually be able to trigger live translation by saying \"Hey T-Mobile\" instead.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen T-Mobile live translations will go liveTesting for T-Mobile's live translation will begin \"for selected users\" this spring, with more general availability planned for \"later this year.\" The feature will be free during the beta, although a surcharge might be added after it goes into wide release. \"We will share more on pricing and plan details closer to commercial launch,\" Miller told PCMag.To sign up for the beta and put your hat in the ring for selection, head over to t-mobile.com/benefits/live-translation.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Finally, the case had something to go on, even if it was only doorbell video of a masked stranger.When I saw the footage, I assumed this was something the FBI had in their possession since the beginning, and had finally decided to release to the public. But that's not what happened at all. If you have been following this case closely, you may know that law enforcement had previously confirmed that Guthrie's Google Nest camera was disconnected (presumably by the perpetrator), and that she did not have a subscription that would store video either on the doorbell or in the cloud. Yet despite the fact the doorbell should have been a dead end, the FBI has seemingly produced this video out of thin air.If you have a Google Nest device in or attached to your home, this might give you pause. Sure, it's one thing if law enforcement is able to obtain video from your subscription or from the device itself. But if you don't keep video records on your Nest, it seems it is still possible to retrieve the footage. How did the FBI do this, and what does it mean for the privacy of your Nest devices?   \nThe FBI likely pieced the video together from fragmentsThe short answer is that we don't really know for sure how the FBI got the footage, but there are a few leads. According to FBI Director Kash Patel, the Google Nest footage was recovered \"from residual data located in backend systems.\" That's pretty vague, though the FBI isn't necessarily known for its transparency.According to experts that spoke to NBC News, however, it is possible to obtain data from the \"complex infrastructure\" of cloud-based cameras, including Google Nest devices. Retired FBI agent Timothy Gallagher told NBC News that Guthrie's Nest camera might have sent images to Google's cloud service, or at least stored data points locally throughout the hardware of the device, even though she wasn't paying for a Nest subscription. The FBI could have obtained the footage from the cloud this way, or pieced together the video from those data points. Both possibilities track, based on how Nest cameras work without a subscription: While you need to pay Google in order to save video clips from your Nest cameras, some Nest devices record event histories and store them on-device. The third-gen wired Nest Doorbell can save up to 10 seconds of clips, while the first and second-gen wired doorbells can save up to three hours of event history, all without a subscription. They also support live video feeds when motion is detected, which could impact the video data points saved to the device or cloud.It's entirely possible the subject walking up to the camera triggered the doorbell to save an event history. But since it took the FBI so long to produce the footage, and since the director claims it was obtained from \"residual data,\" my guess is it wasn't readily available in Guthrie's Google Home app. Maybe the event history saved to the cloud, but it wasn't clear where it was located. Maybe it was overwritten, but the FBI was able to build it back up with recovered data points. My guess would learn toward the latter, as authorities did say the camera had been disconnected. Unfortunately, we don't have a definitive answer at this time, even if the theory is sound.    \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI've reached out to Google for comment, and will update this piece if I hear back. Should you get rid of your Nest camera over privacy concerns?Based on what we know, it doesn't really seem like your Nest doorbell or camera is a fourth amendment disaster waiting to happen—but I don't blame anyone for being concerned. After all, if you don't have a Nest subscription, you might have been comforted by the thought that none of your footage was being saved anywhere, meaning law enforcement or other authorities would have nothing to seize if you somehow popped up on their radar. That doesn't necessarily appear to be the case. That said, without a subscription, you don't have access to a collection of all clips your Nest camera has ever recorded. You might have a limited event history saved, based on motion detection, but that will be limited to three hours of data. Your device might have data points that an organization like the FBI could theoretically use to restore footage, but that's likely true for any camera or smart doorbell system—not just Nest.Also, this is not a Ring situation—Google hasn't partnered with organizations like Flock to help law enforcement request footage from users. Nest also lacks Ring's \"Search Party\" feature, which can turn a neighborhood into a kind of surveillance state, and probably not just to search for lost dogs. I'm not dismissing every security and privacy concern, of course: By putting a commercially-available smart camera on your front door, you are placing your data in the hands of companies like Google or Amazon. If you want to eliminate the risk of the FBI obtaining your doorbell footage, you simply can't have a doorbell with a camera. But barring a warrant, or a Nancy Guthrie-level situation, the chances of your Nest doorbell footage actually being used against you seem rather slim. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

(They took some work to put together, too.) Digital music sort of killed mixtapes, but, in their place, came playlists. You could easily put together a collection of your favorite songs, and either burn them to a CD, or, as streaming took over, let the playlist itself grow as large as you wanted. Anyone can make a playlist, but there's an art to it. Someone with a keen ear for music can build a playlist you can let play for hours. Maybe you have a friend who's good at making playlists, or maybe you're that friend in your group. They can be a fun way to share music, and find some new music to add to your own library. Now, generative AI wants to replace human intervention altogether. Rather than you or a friend building a playlist, you can ask AI to do it for you. And YouTube Music is the latest service to give it a try.\nYouTube announced its new AI playlist generator in a post on X on Monday. If you subscribe to either YouTube Premium or YouTube Music Premium, you can ask YouTube's AI to make a playlist based on whatever parameters you want. To try it out, open YouTube Music, then head to your Library and tap \"New.\" Next, choose the new \"AI Playlist\" option, then enter the type of music you're looking for. You could ask YouTube Music to generate a playlist of pop-punk songs, or to make something to play when focusing on work. Really, it's whatever you want, and if the AI gets it wrong, you can try it again. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nIt's pretty straightforward, and nothing revolutionary. Other music streaming services have their own AI playlist generators too. Spotify, for example, has had one for a couple of years, but recently rolled out Prompted Playlist as well, which lets you generate playlists that update with time, and takes your listening history into account. With this update, however, YouTube is likely trying to drum up some interest in its streaming service and encourage users to pay for it. Just this week, the company put lyrics—once a free feature—behind the Premium paywall. I suppose it thinks that if you can't read what your favorite artists are singing, and you'd like to have a bot make your playlists for you, you might just subscribe to its platform. This could be a good change in the long run for YouTube Music subscribers. I'm on Apple Music, so I don't really use AI-generated playlists. I like the Apple-curated playlists, as well as the ones my friends and I make and share. But who knows: Maybe human-generated playlists are going the way of the mixtape.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Most of the online services providing access to traditional TV, however, don't allow you to only subscribe to sports. That's going to change.Today YouTube TV announced new plans that are a little bit cheaper than the current cost of $82.99 per month. Among them is a $64.99-per-month Sports plan, which includes access to the big national sports channels including FS1, NBC Sports Network, and all of the ESPN channels, along with access to network television. Basically, if a game is broadcast nationally, this package should give you access. And it will eventually give you access to many out-of-market—the post mentions that ESPN Unlimited will be part of the bundle starting in the fall.The new plan is only an $18 discount over the \"main\" YouTube TV plan, but if you're already paying for YouTube TV and are only ever watching sports, this could be a nice discount, particularly if you get access to ESPN Unlimited. \nThere are a few other discounted plans included in the announcement: The Sports + News package adds CNBC, Fox News, MSNow (formerly MSNBC), CNN, and more to the sports bundle, and costs $71.99. That's only $11 cheaper than the full plan, but is still a nice discount if you were only watching sports and news.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut maybe the biggest savings are for people who don't want to watch sports at all. The Entertainment plan costs $54.99, which is $28 cheaper than the main plan ($336 cheaper per year). If you only watch entertainment channels, with no news or sports, this is the package to look into.There will be more than 10 plans like this rolling out in the next few weeks, according to YouTube TV. I've long dreamed of a world where I could pay only for the cable channels I care about at an affordable rate.

I've written before about add-ons that manage to slip through official store safeguards and even some that \"wake up\" as malware after operating normally for several years, so it should come as no surprise that a host of AI-powered browser extensions—collectively  installed by tens of millions of users—may also be invading your privacy. Researchers at data removal service Incogni looked at browser extensions available in the Chrome Web Store that included \"AI\" in their name or description and employed AI as part of their core functionality. By analyzing the data collected and permissions required, they assessed both how likely extensions are to be used maliciously and their potential to cause significant damage if compromised.AI-powered browser extensions collect extensive user dataIncogni found that website content, such as text, images, sounds, videos, and hyperlinks, was the most commonly collected data type (by nearly a third of AI-powered extensions). More than 29% of extensions investigated harvest personally identifiable information (PII)—name, address, email, age, identification number, for example—from users. Other forms of data collected include user activity, authentication information, personal communication, location, financial and payment information, web history, and health information. \nThe most invasive extensions fall in the programming and mathematical aid category (such as Classology AI and StudyX), followed closely by meeting assistants and audio transcribers. Writing and personal assistants also pose privacy risks—and many of these are also among the most downloaded AI-powered extensions in Chrome. How popular AI-powered Chrome extensions stack up on privacyIncogni also assigned \"privacy-invasiveness\" scores to the most downloaded AI-powered extensions, a combination of the amount of data collected and both general and sensitive permissions required: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGrammarly: AI Writing Assistant and Grammar Checker App (tied for #1)Quillbot: AI Writing and Grammar Checker Tool (tied for #1)Sider: Chat wiht all AI (tied for #3)AI Grammar Checker & Paraphraser — LanguageTool (tied for #3)Google Translate (tied for #4)WPS PDF — Read, Edit, Fill, Convert, and AI Chat PDF with Ease (tied for #4)Monica: All-in-One AI Assist  (tied for #4)AI Chat for Google (tied for #4)Immersive Translate — Translate Web & PDFChatGPT searchGrammarly and Quillbot were found to collect PII and website content as well as location data like region, IP address, and GPS coordinates. Grammarly also harvest user activity through network monitoring, clicks, mouse and scroll positions, and keystroke logging. While both also require sensitive permissions—such as the ability to inject code into websites and access active browser tabs—they have a relatively low risk of being used maliciously. How to protect your personal informationBrowser extensions that use AI aren't inherently bad, but you should be aware of what information they are collecting and what permissions they are requiring. The most common type of sensitive permissions required are scripting, which allows the extension to interact with pages as you navigate online, as well as activeTab, which lets it read or modify the page for the current session. When adding an extension (or installing an app or program), carefully review the permissions requested. If they aren't essential to the extension's functionality–or if they are but don't seem justified—you may be putting your data or device at risk by allowing them. As Incogni points out, users have to decide how much privacy to sacrifice in order to use apps and services. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

She has been writing professionally since 2018, creating product reviews, affiliate articles, and search ads for global clients while working with Rubix Agency and Cognizant.

That also undercuts its current $339.99 price on Amazon, and price trackers suggest this is the lowest it has ever been. Woot's deal runs for another three weeks or until stock sells out, so don't wait too long to make a decision here. Amazon Prime members get free standard shipping (while everyone else pays $6), though shipping is limited to the contiguous U.S. \nThis is Samsung’s most feature-heavy watch, and the LTE connectivity means you can leave your phone at home and still take calls, send texts, and stream music. That alone gives it a strong edge over wifi-only smartwatches, especially for runners, cyclists, or folks trying to spend less time glued to their phones.This model is part of Samsung’s latest Watch 8 lineup, which launched last summer, and it has already earned strong praise, including an “excellent” review from PCMag, which named it the best Android smartwatch of 2025. Its Super AMOLED display is bright enough to read outdoors, even in harsh sunlight, and the interface feels responsive thanks to Samsung’s Exynos W1000 processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health tracking goes well beyond steps, with support for a wide range of fitness and wellness tools, including heart rate, ECG, temperature, blood oxygen, and even antioxidant levels. Google Gemini also comes preloaded for smarter voice control. That said, this watch plays best with Samsung phones. You’ll need any Android 12+ phone to use it, but some of the more advanced features, like snoring detection, are locked to Samsung devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe trade-off, as with most Samsung watches, is battery life. Real-world usage lands around 26 hours, so daily charging is part of the routine. That won’t work for everyone. On the upside, durability is solid, with IP68 dust and water resistance, a 5ATM swim rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification for tougher conditions. If you’re all-in on Samsung and want a fully independent smartwatch, this deal makes a lot of sense, especially at this price. But, if you’re still weighing options, see how it stacks up against Google’s flagship wearable, the Pixel Watch 4, here.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.Chat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.The problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

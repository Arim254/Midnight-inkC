But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.How the Google Forms job scam worksThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job. As Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials. \nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page. How to avoid phishing attempts on your Google credentialsAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms. This is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        For all its faults as a platform, YouTube’s video player functionality is easily among the best online. It streams reliably to almost every device you can think of, in your choice of both video quality and playback speed. But it’s the array of hidden features and interface tricks that push it over the edge for me. (Other video players, take note.) Here are 10 of my favorite hacks that make YouTube easier to use.Search YouTube video transcripts with Ctrl-FAlmost every video on YouTube either has an official or auto-generated subtitled track. While these are mainly used for captioning, you can also pull up this transcript on the web and use Ctrl-F (or Cmd-F on Macs) to search for keywords in a video and jump straight to the part you want to see.This feature has been around for a while, but YouTube has shuffled around where to find the transcript from time to time. As of this writing, the most reliable way to find it is to open the video’s description, scroll to the bottom, and click Show transcript to open it up in a side bar.\nSet a sleep timer for long videosFour hour video essays and ASMR streams can be great background noise to help you fall asleep. However, if you want to avoid getting jolted awake by that one really loud joke you forgot about, you can set a sleep timer to pause any video after a certain amount of time.On web or mobile, click the Settings icon on any given video and choose Sleep timer (on mobile, it may be under Settings > More). You can choose a timer ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. You can also automatically pause once the current video is over, which is helpful if you usually have auto-play enabled.Link to specific timestamps in a videoOne of YouTube’s handiest features is the ability to deep-link to a specific second of any video, like I did in the last section. There are several ways to get a precise timestamp link. If you’re on the web, you can right click a video and choose “Copy video URL at current time.” And on mobile, when you click the Share icon, you can tap the toggle next to the timestamp to add the precise link.If none of those are options, you can even create your own timestamp link. At the end of any video URL, add “&t=01h05m47s”, replacing the numbers with the specific time you want to link to. You can use any combination of hours, minutes, and seconds to specify the point in the video you want.Use arrow keys or double-taps for quick navigationMost video players at this point have some kind of “Hang on, what did they just say?” button that lets you skip 5-10 seconds backward or forward. YouTube has several. The most straightforward, on mobile, is the double-tap. Tap twice on the left side of the screen to go backwards 10 seconds, and on the right to go forward. Keep tapping to move forward or back by further increments of 10 seconds.On the web, you have even finer grain control. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move 5 seconds back and forth. Alternatively, you can use the J-K-L keys to move in 10 second increments (with K being used to pause the video). This latter method is borrowed from video editors, making it a handy way to keep your muscle memory consistent if you do a lot of editing.Move frame-by-frame with keyboard shortcutsYouTubers love putting walls of text in a single frame of a video that you have to pause to be able to read. On mobile, the only way to read these–or examine any specific frame–is to back up and try to time your pause perfectly. On the web, however, there’s a better way. While paused on a video, you can press the , (comma) or . (period) keys to move back or forward exactly one frame at a time. You can hold these keys down to slowly move through frames as well.Quickly fast-forward with a long-pressIt’s pretty common knowledge at this point that you can play YouTube videos at 2x (or higher) speed, but what if you only want to rush through a small part of a video, like an ad read? On the mobile version of YouTube, there’s a handy gesture to do just that, without changing your default playback speed.Simply long-press and hold anywhere on the video while it’s playing. This will temporarily cause the video to play back at 2x speed, until you lift your finger. If you’re already watching at 2x or higher, it won’t play any faster (or slower) than your current speed, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSet your video quality defaultsYouTube generally does a pretty good job of automatically deciding what video quality to stream at, balancing fidelity with bandwidth demands. You can manually override this on a per-video basis, but on mobile, you have a few more options to get broader control.In the YouTube mobile app, head to Settings > Quality. Here, you can set separate quality defaults for video when you’re streaming over mobile networks or wifi, as well as audio quality. The latter is particularly helpful if you use YouTube for listening to music or podcasts. If your wifi is reliably fast, it can be worth it to set higher quality defaults, rather than manually change each video’s resolution whenever you notice the quality looks degraded. Use incognito mode to preserve your suggestionsYouTube can get overly eager to show you videos even vaguely similar to one you watched before. If you’d rather not get a feed full of videos on how to fix a door, you can use an incognito tab to browse without contributing to your algorithm’s history. It’s a little tougher on mobile, but fortunately the YouTube app has an option for that.In the mobile YouTube app, navigate to the You tab. Along the top of the screen, tap “Turn on incognito.” This will let you search and browse without any algorithmic recommendations or contributing to your history. You can manually turn off incognito mode, or it will automatically turn off after 90 minutes of inactivity. Note, if you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, none of your benefits will apply while you’re browsing incognito.Remove unwanted videos from your historyIf you forget to turn on incognito mode, you can still remove videos from your browsing history so they won’t muck up your recommendations. To do this, head to your YouTube history on mobile or the web, tap the three-dot menu next to the video in question, and choose “Remove from watch history.”This is usually enough to prevent a video from becoming the algorithm’s latest fixation, but it also means you won’t be able to find the video in your history again. If you want provide any kind of direct feedback, like a thumbs down or a report, make sure to do that first. Otherwise, if you navigate to the video again, it will be re-added to your history.Master even more keyboard shortcutsBeyond basic navigation, YouTube on the web has a plethora of helpful keyboard shortcuts that you might never encounter that are worth knowing about. Some of them are pretty niche, but you never know when they can come in handy:Up and Down arrows: Turn the volume on a video up or down in 5% increments.Shift+> and Shift+<:> Speed up or slow down the current video playback speedM: Mute the current video.F: Enter/exit fullscreen mode.T: Enter/exit Theater modeShift+N: Play the next video in your queue or playlist.Shift+P: Play the previous video in your queue or playlist.Ctrl/Cmd+Left or Right arrow keys: Navigate to the next or previous chapter in a video.\n            ",

As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.WhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.Speaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: WhatsApp\n                    \n    \nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.Still, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.WhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

With its latest update, Google Chrome for desktop now has three new productivity features: Split View, PDF annotations, and the ability to save downloads directly to Google Drive. These features are targeted at both regular and enterprise users, the company says, so you don't need to worry about Workspace exclusivity. Let's take a look at each new feature and how you can best use it.Split View lets you boost your productivity\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nOver the years, the internet browser has become a super app of sorts, since it has access to so many useful sites and web apps. In Chrome, I often find myself taking notes while attending meetings online, or keeping a second tab open for research while I write articles. For many people, a single Chrome tab or window is no longer enough, and with that in mind, Google's added Split View to the desktop version of its browser.Split View merges two tabs and displays them in the same window. You can think of it like the split-screen view in old school video games. You can use Split View by right-clicking any tab and selecting Add Tab to New Split View. For now, Chrome allows you to have a maximum of two tabs side by side in Split View, although I hope you'll eventually be able to add more in the future. In its current form, the feature is great for using Google Docs while watching an educational video, or similar two-tab use cases. Finally, no more opening single tabs in separate windows and then resizing them into your own, makeshift split view.\nYou can easily drag the slider in between the two tabs to give one tab more screen space than the other. Or for more control, you can click the Split View button to the left of the address bar and select the Arrange Split View menu (this is also available if you right click the merged tabs in your tab bar). This is an easy way to quickly reverse the order of the two tabs, separate them, or close just one of the tabs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate PDFs in Chrome\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLet's be honest: Chrome is probably the PDF viewer that most people use. No matter how many fancy PDF editing apps I or my colleagues recommend, for the most part, you're going to search for and open PDFs in your browser. Luckily, now you no longer have to use a different app for basic annotations. Chrome's desktop PDF Viewer now has tools for highlighting text, adding notes, and even making digital signatures. You're still going to need a different app for advanced PDF edits, but Chrome is now capable enough to handle the basics.Save PDF files directly to Google Drive\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhenever you download a PDF file using Google Chrome, it defaults to saving them to the Downloads folder on your computer, or to another location on your hard drive. On desktop, Google now lets you save these files directly to your Google Drive account. This can be very useful if you want to keep your local storage clear. When you open a PDF file in Chrome, you'll see a Google Drive icon in the toolbar, next to the download button. Clicking the Google Drive icon will automatically save it to the cloud storage service, in a new folder called \"Saved from Chrome.\"\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.If you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n    \n            \n            You can mute some or all of your phone's notifications when driving.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.On both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.Other Android Auto notification settingsAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.When you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.There are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n    \n            \n            You can control how messages appear on your dashboard.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.It's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.You should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

For context, new pairs of this model typically sell between $90 and $99 on Amazon, while used listings often hover around $69. As for their refurbished condition, they’ve undergone diagnostic testing to confirm that everything works properly and should show little to no cosmetic wear. Shipping is free for Amazon Prime members; everyone else pays $6. That said, Woot does not ship this product to Alaska, Hawaii, or P.O. Boxes. This deal runs for another three days or until it’s sold out, whichever comes first.\nThese IPX4-rated earbuds pair easily with both iOS and Android devices, which isn’t always a given for products owned by Apple. You still get the perks people expect, like simple one-tap pairing and Find My support on iPhone, but Android users aren’t left out. The buds themselves are small and lightweight, and once you find the right fit from the three included ear tip sizes, they stay secure. The glossy finish can make them slightly slippery when you’re putting them in, but they don’t feel bulky once seated. Sound-wise, these lean into bass. Vocals and instruments stay clear enough, but this isn’t a neutral, studio-accurate sound.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe active noise cancellation does a decent job with steady background noise like engine hum on a flight or the rumble of a train. It won’t block out higher-pitched sounds or conversations as effectively as premium models from Sony or Bose, but at this price, having usable ANC at all is notable, according to this PCMag review. There’s also a Transparency mode for when you need to hear what’s going on around you. You can play or pause music, answer calls, and switch between ANC and Transparency directly from the earbuds, though you’ll still need your phone to adjust volume. Battery life runs about five hours with ANC on, or up to eight without it, and the case provides another 10 to 16 hours depending on how you use them.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Right now, it’s cheaper than it's ever been at 30% off, bringing its price down from $279.99 to $196.99.\nThe monitor offers top-tier 4K clarity for a sub-$200 price tag, with Native 3840×2160 resolution on a 27-inch IPS panel. Its strong color accuracy with HDR400 makes it equally suitable for creative or media consumption. Additionally, it has wide viewing angles and reliable brightness (around 400 nits, which isn’t cinema-quality, but still impressive for a budget 4K monitor), which improves daytime visibility but is modest compared to pricier monitors. Users can adjust the monitor's pivot, tilt, and height, while HDMI and DisplayPort make it a good choice for most desk setups.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGiven its 60Hz refresh rate, it’s better for work, watching movies, and casual gaming; competitive gamers might find it limiting. It also lacks USB-C connectivity, which is a con for those who use laptops like a MacBook. While it can’t offer the same as luxury displays, if you’re looking for a monitor that gets it all done, whether that’s light gaming, office work, media consumption, or content creation, the 27-inch LG 27UP650K-W Ultrafine 4K monitor is a strong budget 4K productivity and casual gaming monitor, particularly at less than $200 with its current discount.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The company is removing Meta Quest users to focus on mobile users. So Horizon Worlds, originally a VR-only platform, now a mix of both VR users and mobile users, will become a mobile-only platform in the near future. In a blog post aimed at developers, Samantha Ryan, VP of Content at Meta's Reality Labs, said the company is \"separating our Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform in order to create more space for both products to grow.\"\"We’re doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem while shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile. By breaking things down into two distinct platforms, we’ll be better able to clearly focus on each,\" Ryan wrote.Announced in 2019 as a \"social VR world\" called Facebook Horizon, the platform was renamed Horizon Worlds two years later and was an integral part of Meta's vision of a future \"Metaverse,\" but Worlds never really caught on with users. Despite the money Facebook/Meta clearly devoted to the platform, its monthly user count was only around 200,000 in 2022. \nAccording to Ryan, 86% of time people spend in their VR headsets is spent with third-party apps, so it's not surprising that Meta would pull back from first-party VR. Last month, the company shuttered its three AAA VR game development companies, stopped updating its first-party subscription-based fitness app Supernatural, and laid off around 10% of its Reality Labs division. Ryan says Meta will continue supporting third-party VR developers and releasing hardware, promising the company has \"robust roadmap of future VR headsets\" tailored to \"different audience segments\" on tap, but offered no specific details as yet. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile the change marks a definitive end to Horizon Worlds as a VR-first destination, the company plans to leverage the massive user base of Meta's Instagram and Facebook to make Worlds competitive with social platforms like Roblox. The company reports 4x growth in Horizon mobile users in 2025.\"We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale,\" Ryan wrote. A sad end for VR users of WorldsThere are around five billion smart phone users worldwide, all potential customers to Worlds, compared to an estimated 20-30 million Quest users, so the math definitely makes sense in terms of growing a platform and stock price, but it's sad for the (relatively few) people who have found a home on Horizon Worlds. They'll be able to use mobile platform, but it isn't the same: the sense of scale and engagement can't be replicated on a small, 2D screen.  I recently spent a lot of time looking for life in the VR version of Worlds, and it's a unique place, an undiscovered country where strange little communities have taken up residence in a massive, deserted shopping mall.

AI could make new televisions more expensive too—as well as—game consoles, cell phones, high-tech coffee makers, and anything else with memory and a processor. But if you're in the market for a new TV, you might be better off buying sooner rather than later.As Axios reports, televisions generally require 1GB to 8GB of RAM to run \"smart TV\" features and to process video and data, and the memory units widely found in 4K TVs have more than quadrupled in price over the last year. That extra cost could be passed on to consumers: Analyst TrendForce said last month that a price hike on TVs was \"unavoidable,\" while Samsung acknowledged it may need to reprice its products. That said, a typical television uses less memory, and less advanced memory, than some other key devices, so a potential price-spike is likely to be less dramatic than it is for things like PCs and smartphones. We'll see for sure when manufacturers announce the prices of their 2026 models.What's causing the RAM shortage?Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia are scooping up memory supply to run AI data centers, and most TV makers don't have the market power of these gigantic corporations. \"When memory tightens, prices rise, product launches shift...margins compress and smaller companies struggle more than large tech giants,\" Marco Mezger, executive vice president of memory tech company Neumonda, told Axios. There is good news for consumers, however. \nWhy right now is a good time to buy a new televisionHigher RAM prices have yet to hit the retail TV market, making now an unusually good time to buy a television. Overall, the price of smart TVs decreased by 15% between 2024 and the start of 2026, so you're starting from a good place. In addition, manufacturers generally offer lower prices at this time of year to clear shelf space ahead of new model releases. While more expensive RAM could be baked into the price of 2026 televisions, sets on the shelves now were priced before the effects of the shortage hit the retail market. Plus, some companies price their TVs lower because they make a lot of money collecting your data—unless you do you what you can to stop them, of course. All of which leads to ridiculously good deals, like $900 for a 65-inch OLED TV from Samsung. Bottom line: if you're in the market for a new TV, don't wait. (Though, chances are, you might not need a new TV.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long is the RAM shortage likely to last?No one can say for sure how long the memory shortage will last, but the consensus of industry analysts is that we likely won't see a return to anything we'd consider normal before 2028. AI demand is projected to consume 70% of all high-end DRAM in 2026, so manufacturers are prioritizing it over the less advanced, less in-demand memory chips used for TVs and appliances. While investors are sinking billions into ramping up memory manufacturing, it takes around 19 months to get a factory up and running in Taiwan, and even longer in the U.S., so TV prices will likely remain high into 2028.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The post-war generation's suburban conformity found a hero in baseball's ultimate company man—Stan Musial—and his 22 seasons on the Cardinals. Boomers were drawn to Broadway Joe Namath, a self-important celebrity who wasn't even a good quarterback. Gen X saw itself in Tiger Woods' stoic, lone-grinder-in-a-high-stakes-vacuum style. This year's Winter Olympics introduced the world to the first iconic athletes that express Gen Z's vibe, and they're amazing. But first, let's talk about Baby Boo Syndrome. It seems like everyone on TikTok has come down with Baby Boo Syndrome this week. The trend started with a short dance video from @selenaaa.dta using a particularly snippet of YoungBoy Never Broke Again's \"What You Is.\" The rapper saying \"She gon call me baby boo\" is both really catchy and really annoying, in other words, a perfect ear-worm.\n\n@selenaaa.dta's unique style earned their video over 10 million views, but it took more than a year for everyone else to catch up and start posting their own choreography to the music. Then things got weird. \nBaby Boo variations and remixes started appearing, like this operatic cover:\n\nand this patriotic remix:\n\nAnd this mash-up with \"Baby Shark\"\n\nThe rapid spread of the trend and the catchiness of the song soon led to people diagnosing cases of \"Baby Boo Syndrome\" in videos like this: \n\nand like this: \n\nand this: \n\nI am getting definite 6-7 vibes with this one. Alysa Liu is Gen Z's sports hero\nOlympic gold medalist figure skater Alysa Liu is that rare athlete that kids should consider a role model. Liu embodies everything that makes people between of 14 and 29, and America itself, so uniquely awesome. First there's the look. Liu's blonde halo highlight and frenulum piercing is fully in tune with Gen Z's aesthetic, but it's deeper than style. Like roughly 22% of Generation Z, Liu is from an immigrant family—her parents are Chinese dissidents who fled after Tiananmen Square. Liu was a skating prodigy, then, like everyone of her age, COVID shaped her destiny. She retired from skating at 16 when her local rink's closure gave her time to consider the strain skating was taking on her mental health. After attending UCLA for two years, Liu came back to the ice, but on her own, very Gen Z, terms: She would be in charge of her training schedule, costumes, and diet. Maybe more importantly, she rejected the competitiveness of her sport in favor of viewing figure skating as an act of self-expression, something fun. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany in the conservative world of figure skating thought she was finished—you don't succeed as a world class athlete while without sacrificing everything in your life for it, and it's definitely not fun. But Liu made it to the Olympics and murdered her individual routine like it was no big deal, then walked off the ice giving NBC's camera a hearty, \"That's what I'm fucking talking about.\" So punk rock. Just as iconic: Liu sharing victory with silver medal winner Kaori Sakamoto of Japan.Amber Glenn: Alysa Liu's nerdier counterpartMaybe she's not as fierce and in-your-face as Liu, but Team USA figure skater Amber Glenn is quietly becoming a Gen Z icon as well. The 26-year-old figure skater is open about her mental health struggles and being queer, and she's also a passionate Magic: The Gathering player. A recent interview reveals that Glenn carries her Magic cards with her, but leaves the \"super fancy\" ones at home because they're her prized possessions, and she doesn't want to lose them. \nViral video of the week: Punch-kun the monkeyThe main character of the internet this week is a baby macaque from the in Japan. Punch-kun was introduced to the world on the Ichikawa City Zoo's twitter account. \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nPunch was born on July 26, 2025, but was rejected by his stressed-out mother. Zookeepers raised him, giving him an orangutan plush toy to replace mom. He drags it everywhere, which is cute, but things got a lot less adorable when the zoo introduced the little guy to other monkeys. It seems to not go well at all.\n\nEveryone spread the video above because how could you not? It's so poignant. Many were moved, and others angered by the seeming mistreatment of Punch by the other macaques, or angry at the zoo for putting him in that position. Weirdly enough, it turns out the internet got it totally wrong. The controversy lead to the zoo explaining that the macaque dragging him around in the video isn't bullying Punch; it's an older member of the troop teaching him how to fit in. It's monkey business. They are wild animals, and they don't do things like humans do. The saga of Punch is ongoing. Sometimes he seems to be getting along with the troop better, sometimes he still seems like an outsider.

But right now, the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus in an Open Box condition is $99.99 at Woot, as compared to its usual $249.99 price on Amazon. The previous low that price trackers tracked was $149, so this deal drops it by another $50. Prime members get free standard shipping, while non-Prime buyers pay a $6 shipping fee. That said, Woot does not ship this product to Alaska, Hawaii, APO addresses, or P.O. Boxes. The sale runs for six more days or until it sells out.\nThis is a 3.1-channel system with three forward-facing drivers and tweeter pairs and two built-in woofers. It’s 37 inches long, which gives it a more substantial presence under a TV. For connectivity, it includes HDMI eARC, optical audio input, USB-A, and a standard power port. You also get Bluetooth for streaming music from your phone, but no wifi, multi-room support, or built-in voice assistant. Despite the name, it does not run the Fire TV smart TV platform. It’s simply a soundbar, and it works with any TV that supports HDMI ARC or optical output, notes this PCMag review. The included remote lets you switch between a few preset EQ modes, adjust bass and treble, and control volume.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn everyday use, it’s a clear upgrade over standard TV speakers. Dialogue sounds crisp and easy to follow, and music has decent detail in the mids and highs, and it can get loud without distortion. The main limitation is bass. On its own, it doesn’t deliver deep low-end impact, so action scenes and bass-heavy tracks won’t feel especially full. Amazon does offer bundles with a wireless subwoofer for $374.99 or a 5.1 setup with surrounds for $489.99, if you want to add more weight and immersion. Also, while the bar supports Dolby Atmos, without height channels, the effect is limited.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And if you’re starting off with a small house to begin with, you hit maximum storage pretty quickly. That can make DIY home maintenance and other projects a challenge, because so many of the tools you need are kind of enormous and awkwardly-shaped, making their storage problematic even in spacious homes.While hand tools like hammers and screwdrivers can usually be stashed creatively, larger items eat up your spare room pretty quickly—unless you opt for a folding or collapsible version. These tools do the same job, but shrink down when not in use so they can squeeze into tight spots or unexpected locations, solving your storage problems.A folding ladder is easy to store in a garage or shedLadders can be some of the biggest storage challenges because they are, by their very nature, extremely large and rigid. If you don’t have enough vertical or horizontal space to store a ladder, it can wind up just sort of standing in an odd place, collecting dust in between uses and making your home look like a perpetual job site.\nYou have two small-space options to solve for this, though. The most common is a telescoping ladder, which collapses down to a portion of its height when not in use. This can make it a lot easier to find storage space in a closet or other location, and it can even be hidden behind furniture. Another option is a folding ladder like this one from DuoSaftey, which folds into a stick-like form when not in use, minimizing its horizontal footprint instead of its vertical footprint.This wheeled cart can be store in a laundry room or closetA sturdy, wheeled cart is incredibly useful in a lot of maintenance and repair jobs, making it easy to transport tools and materials around the area. But who has the space to have a whole cart just sitting around until it’s needed? A folding cart is the answer: It folds flat for easy storage, but snaps into a sturdy full-sized cart that can handle up to 300 pounds of weight when it’s needed.Get a collapsible bubble level that folds around cornersA bubble level is a necessity if you want your home projects to look like a sane, rational person performed the work. But a full-size level is often difficult to find space for, and smaller levels aren’t as useful for larger projects.This folding level not only collapses into a tiny form factor for storage, it can be bent and used to check level around corners, which is one of those DIY superpowers you don’t realize you need until you learn about its existence.This folding saw is great for the occasional DIY projectSaws are another rigid tool that can be problematic to store. Hanging them on a wall is a good solution that gets them out of the way, but if you need to pack your tools out of sight, you need to consider a folding saw like this one. If you saw wood every day of your life, you might not want this, but if you need a saw for the occasional quick project around the house and don’t have storage space to spare, this will get the job done and fold up and away when not needed.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStore this pop-up workbench in the garageLike rolling carts, workbenches are incredibly useful when you need a flat surface to work on, but become a real pain when it’s time to store them away. Luckily, you can pick up a folding workbench like this one from DeWalt. It’s a sturdy work surface that can support up to 1,000 pounds, but when the job is done, it folds up to be slid into the tightest spot you have available.This collapsible bucket fits under the sink or in a utility closetEveryone needs a job bucket in the house, but the traditional five-gallon bucket not only takes up more space than you realize, it also becomes a place to store stuff in, making it a chore to unpack every time you need to use it. A folding bucket like this one isn’t quite as large (it’s only three gallons), but it collapses into an easily-stored flat configuration when you’re not using it, preventing it from tempting you with all that empty space.A folding hand truck can transport heavy stuff and then get tucked away in a closetFor years, I had a hand truck stored in my crawl space, because a hand truck was an incredibly useful thing. Any time I had to move bags of cement or large items around, I’d have to climb down into that nightmarish crawl space and retrieve the hand truck, which was a pain in the butt. Now I have this folding handtruck, which does the same job (it can handle more than 300 pounds) but can be tucked away in a closet when not in use.Use this folding shovel for gardening and clearing out snowEvery house needs a shovel. You either have a garden or backyard where digging will occasionally be needed, or you’ll need to clear snow from your sidewalks and driveway. Or both! Shovels tend to be left in garages or outside when not in use, but if you need to store yours in a small space inside, a folding option is a real space-saver. It collapses into a compact square that will squeeze into any space, but it’s sturdy enough for the toughest jobs you can throw at it.\n            \n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Jordan and the team.\n            Smarter Home & Living NewsletterNever miss a story.\n                    Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Jordan and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar Tactical Watch is one of the brand’s best solar-charged options—an right now, it’s 40% off on Amazon, dropping its price from $499.99 to $299.99.\nCompared to its predecessor, the Garmin Instinct Solar 2X produces up to 50% more energy from the sun thanks to the Power Glass lens, which is particularly helpful in GPS mode, which can drain the battery quickly. It’s also 0.8 mm thinner, has a built-in LED flashlight, a compass, and an altimeter. It also has a number of health- and fitness-tracking features, including Pulse Ox, heart rate monitoring, and sleep monitoring stats that are meant to help you train and recover more efficiently. The watch also contains integrated sports apps.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTrackBack is another helpful feature that lets you use location readings to keep track of where you last left your car or where you started your hike, for example. That said, this device doesn't have a touchscreen; users are limited to a button-based interface, and app support on the Garmin Connect IQ app is somewhat limited. The display is also somewhat bare-bones compared to more vibrant AMOLED options like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (that said, there are some benefits to an MIP screen over AMOLED.)\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.As part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears. While I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.    \nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther new features in this Release Preview Channel updateThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.  You can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.   \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026. What the Google Chrome patch fixesThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data. CVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system. \nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat Chrome users need to doGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on. Chrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window. Apply these updates immediately by tapping the three dots and selecting the first menu item. Chrome will need to restart to complete the update. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

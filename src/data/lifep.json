If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

Modern TVs are basically computers, complete with their own operating systems and application ecosystems. That means you can tweak them to run better.—or just the way you want them to. Here are a few tips, tricks, and hacks that every smart TV owner should be aware of.Turn off motion smoothing on your smart TVWondering why every single TV show and movie you watch on your brand new TV looks like a soap opera or a cheap community theater production? It's probably because of motion smoothing.This \"feature\", which is the default on far too many TVs, artificially ups the frame rate from either 24 or 30 frames per second to 60 or 120 frames, or even higher. This effect can bring a real immediacy to live events like sports, but it's not great for regular old TV shows. Because where does the TV get those extra frames from? It makes them up, often creating an uncanny blurring effect reminiscent of old school videotape. I recommend turning this feature off basically the minute you set up your TV, and our friends at PCMag have a guide to disabling the feature covering all the major smart TV platforms.Hook up an ethernet cable to make your smart TV faster Streaming 4k takes up a lot of bandwidth. Modern wifi routers can usually handle without much of an issue, especially if your TV is close to your router. Even so, it's a good idea to physically connect your smart TV to your network with an ethernet cable if you have the option.There's a couple of reasons to do this. One, wired connections are more stable, mostly because they're not vulnerable to interference from neighboring wireless networks and other devices, so you'll be far less like to suffer through stuttering images or audio dropouts. Two, connecting your TV via ethernet frees up the wireless spectrum for all of your other devices, which is important if you live in a house with other internet users (not to mention other smart devices).Customize your smart TV's home screenSmart TVs tend to come pre-loaded with any number of apps, all of them prominently placed on the home screen. You can, and should, move the apps you actually use to the top instead. How to do this will vary depending on your operating system, but it generally means pressing and holding on the app you want was at the top of the list and then moving it around. Failing that, you may need to do some digging in the settings.Block ads on your smart TVTired of all the ads showing up on your TV? You might be able to block them using your router. Lifehacker has a guide to blocking ads on Samsung, LG, and Roku smart TVs that explains how to change your internet settings so that your TV can't access the ads in the interface anymore.Disable quick start to save energy and speed up your smart TVSmart TVs are basically computers, meaning they need to boot up when you turn them on. Most users don't want to wait every time they turn on the TV though, which is why smart TVs don't actually turn off—they suspend their functions, the same way your phone or laptop does. That's fine if you use your TV constantly, but a real waste of electricity for a TV that you only turn on occasionally. And shutting down your set completely could have another benefit: reducing bugginess. To reiterate, a smart TV is basically a computer, and every computer user knows that restarting your computer can fix random problems.Some TVs allow you to disable this feature—just look for a \"quick start\" option in the settings. Others, including Sony, suggest that you unplug TVs you won't be using for months at a time in order to shut them down completely.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse an antenna to get free channelsStreaming television is great, but don't overlook traditional broadcast TV. Most major cultural events, from the Super Bowl, to the Oscars, to the World Series, are still free to watch on network TV, as are of the most popular shows. If you live in a major city, or even just close to one, there's a good chance you can watch network TV free of charge using nothing more than a small TV antenna. This can mean free access to stations like NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and PBS—no need to pay for cable or a pricey \"live tv\" streaming subscription. All you need to do is plug in an antenna, scan for channels, and you're good to go. (Lifehacker has a guide to the best digital TV antennas to help you get started.)Clear your smart TV's cacheNot to keep harping on this point, but a smart TV is a computer, and like a computer, it can build up all sorts of junk in its memory over time. If your smart TV is suddenly moving more slowly than you remember, or even crashing, it might be time to clear out its various caches. Get started with this guide to clearing the cache on every major smart TV brand.Enable security features on your smart TVYour smart TV is a potential security risk. It's a computer, like any other, and that means you need to keep it up to date, secure all accounts connected to it, and be mindful of any built-in microphones and cameras. Check out our guide to securing your smart TV for more on these tips and more.Disable \"automatic content recognition\" to stop your smart TV from spying on youI've written about why smart TVs are so cheap, and it turns out a big part of it is automatic content recognition, or ACR. Most brands of smart TVs are constantly monitoring what you're watching and using that to build a profile with your viewing habits that can be sold to third parties, a practice that nets the TV manufacturers are lot of money. If this concerns you, consider turning the feature off to protect your privacy. Lifehacker has a guide to disabling ACR on the major smart TV platforms.Install a different launcher for your smart TVIf you want your smart TV to have an entirely different look and feel, you may be able to install a different launcher, which will give you much more control. Google TV users, for example, can install Projectivy to completely replace the default launcher. This won't be an option for every model of smart TV, but it's worth considering if you're feeling stuck with the software that came preinstalled.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

The platform is speedy, simple, and supports just about every streaming app out there.If you've got a Roku or two in your life, you may not be using it to its full potential. These tips, hacks, and hidden features should help you go beyond the basic business of launching your streaming apps and get more out of your hardware, whether you've just unboxed your first Roku device, or you've been using one for years.Set up PIN protection to protect your RokuIf you've got young kids or nosy housemates living with you, you can lock certain parts of the Roku experience (including making purchases and adding new channels) behind a PIN number. This is actually done through your Roku account page on the web: Click PIN/parental controls on the left, and you can set a new PIN or change an existing one.Change the look and feel of your Roku with a new themeYou don't have to settle for the standard Roku interface visuals—you can easily switch to a different theme (which basically means a different wallpaper and screensaver). From Settings on your device, choose Themes to see alternatives provided by Roku and other people in the Roku community. You can always pick Restore default theme to go back to the original look.Enable captions on replayYou might not want closed captions on all the time, but you can have them enabled whenever you skip backward. From the home screen, pick Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode > On replay to enable this. Note that the streaming app you're using needs to support the feature as well, so it may not work everywhere.Put your most-watched apps up topThis is a simple and effective one that you might not have got around to doing: You can organize the apps on the home screen so your most-used are nearer the top and easier to get to. Select any tile on the home screen, press the star button on your remote to bring up the context menu, and you'll see the Move app and Move app to top options.Make use of Guest Mode when you have company\n    \n            \n            Roku devices come with a Guest Mode included.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's great having guests—but don't let them mess up your recommendations and viewing progress. You can put your Roku device into Guest Mode by opening Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Guest Mode > Enter Guest Mode. You'll be signed out of all your apps, and the Roku device will restart ready for someone else to use it.Send your photos to your Roku to view them on the big screenYou won't always be watching films and shows on your Roku of course—and when your streaming device isn't doing anything else you can get images from your Google Photos library up on your TV. To set this up, you need to head to the Photostreams page on the Roku website, sign in using your account, and then follow the instructions online.Set up a cross-platform Roku watchlistThere will often be times when you see something interesting, but don't have time to watch it right away, and that's when the Roku watchlist feature can help. Select any movie or show from the home screen, and on the listing page use the Save button to add it to your list: You can then pick Save List from the main menu to see what you've saved.Pair your Bluetooth headphones to your RokuIf you've got a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and a Roku device that supports Bluetooth, you can pair the two together for some private audio listening— handy if you don't want to disturb anyone around you. You can do this by heading to Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Remotes & devices > Wireless headphones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nListen to your Roku via your smartphoneThere's another way to listen through headphones, and it doesn't require Bluetooth or wireless headphones. If you install the aforementioned Roku app on your smartphone, then plug a pair of headphones into your phone as well, you can tap Remote control in the app and then the headphone button to stream the audio right to your ears.\n    \n            \n            You can use the mobile app to listen over headphones.\n                                        Credit: Roku\n                    \n    \nMirror your other devices to your RokuApple devices: Roku sticks, boxes and TVs come with support for the Apple AirPlay standard built right in, so you can beam across audio and video from Apple devices, or even mirror your Mac display on the big screen. On the Roku, choose Settings then Apple AirPlay and HomeKit to make sure you're set up, then just select the AirPlay button on your Apple hardware.Android devices: For screen casting, you're not left out if you're on Android, though—as usual with Android—capabilities vary between devices. Samsung Galaxy phones have the smoothest integration: Swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen, choose Smart View, and your Roku should show up as a connection option (if it's on the same wifi network).Windows devices: If you want to mirror your screen to a Roku from Windows, the process is different again. First, enable the feature on the Roku via Settings > System > Screen mirroring. Next, from Windows, click the volume and wifi icons down in the lower right corner, click the Display button, then select your Roku. Again, it needs to be on the same wifi network.Quickly find the cheapest way to rent a show or movieIf you're in the mood for a movie rental, then you've got a whole host of different streaming services to choose from—all the big ones offer film rentals on top of the content you get with your subscription. Use the Search option from the main Roku menu to look for a title, and compare the different prices across all the services you're signed up to.Control your TV with your Roku remoteYou can turn your TV on and off and adjust its volume with your Roku remote, if you'd like to. You're asked if you want to do this when you first set up your Roku device, but you can configure it afterwards too: Pick Settings > Remotes & devices > Remotes, then choose the remote you've currently got connected, and then pick Set up remote for TV control.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    ",

Clawdbot is designed to be an agentic personal assistant. In layman's terms, that means the bot can perform tasks on your behalf: You give it full access to your computer, and it can organize your inbox, code for you, or clear your calendar (allegedly, anyway). You can also talk to it from a chat app of your choice, like WhatsApp or iMessage, rather than it's own interface. Some people are even buying Mac minis exclusively to run Clawdbot from. If you're wondering where that name came from, it takes after another AI company's product. Creator Peter Steinberger says he was inspired by the monster that appears when users reload Claude Code—Claude being one of the big AI products in the space right now, developed by the company Anthropic. Steinberger decided to go the lobster route with his logo, and named his own lobster mascot \"Clawd.\" From this, Clawdbot was born. The problem: Anthropic also calls Claude Code mascot \"Clawd.\" Whoops.By Tuesday, Clawdbot was no more (in name, anyway). It turns out companies like Anthropic don't appreciate it when you start your own business and use the name of their mascot as your own—especially when you're working in the same ridiculously lucrative field. Maybe if Clawdbot had never taken off, Anthropic wouldn't have noticed, but the bot became an internet sensation, which no doubt landed it on Anthropic's  radar. As such, Clawdbot has officially changed its name to \"Moltbot,\" suggesting a lobster molting from its shell. Clawd is now affectionally known as \"Molty.\" The company made the announcement on its official X page, noting that Anthropic had asked it to change the name over \"trademark stuff.\" (Steinberger struck a different tone on his personal X account, however, writing: \"I was forced to rename the account by Anthropic. Wasn't my decision.\")\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAside from the name change, the bot appears to be the same as it was on Monday. That is to say, it's still open source, still available to run locally on your own device, and still comes with the same inherent security risks I outlined yesterday. I still wouldn't recommend you install a program like Moltbot on your personal device, since, name change or not, you'd still be giving it incredible access to your hardware and its data with little knowledge of the safeguards in place to protect it. All it could take is one malicious prompt injection for Moltbot to molt your security.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to the settlement website, class payment distribution began on Jan. 23, and many users on Reddit report that funds have landed in their bank and payment apps over the last several days. If you see a deposit from \"Lopez Voice Assistant\" or some variation, it's not a scam. The settlement allowed class members to opt for payment via direct deposit (ACH) as well as electronic or paper check, which will be delivered through email or regular mail, respectively. Some class members are reporting that they received their funds via a different method than they expected, so if you submitted a claim, keep an eye on your transactions as well as your mailboxes to confirm receipt. Note that payouts are being distributed in batches and may take a few days to arrive. \nWhat is the Apple Siri settlement? Last year, Apple agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over privacy concerns with Siri-enabled devices. Users whose devices may have activated and recorded conversations without their knowledge were able to claim compensation. Initially, the settlement was set to pay out $20 per device—iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV were all eligible—for up to five devices per individual claimant. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, due to the final class size, the payout came to just $8.02 per device up to a maximum of $40.10.

But just because it's the norm to swap out your smartphone on a regular basis, that doesn't mean all of us do. Smartphones can last a long time, especially if you maintain it with the occasional battery replacement.But no piece of technology lasts forever. Eventually, something gives out—even if it's just the company that makes it. Even Apple, which usually offers its iPhones a number of years of updates after their original release, drops support for new features after some time. That's why your iPhone XS can't run iOS 26: Apple drew the line here this year. But iPhones like the XS can still receive updates, even if they aren't the latest and greatest version of iOS. Instead, Apple tends to issue security and stability patches to older iPhones, to ensure the users who still rely on them can do so safely and securely. It might be in Apple's best financial interest to persuade you to buy a new iPhone, but not at the cost of putting a large number of users at risk of cyber attacks. Apple's latest update patches very old iPhonesApple dropped new updates for an assortment of devices on Monday. That includes its latest devices, of course, which can now install iOS 26.2.1. But a host of older devices also received new updates, some of which are particularly surprising, considering their age. \nApple released iOS 18.7.4 for iPhones that either can't or won't update to iOS 26. In the former category, that basically includes the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. Then, there's iOS 16.7.13, for iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, and iOS 15.8.6, for iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPhone SE (first-gen). Those are some old iPhones, but that's not what caught my eye today. In a twist, Apple dropped an update for iPhones running iOS 12, including iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones can now run iOS 12.5.8. For reference, Apple released iOS 12 back in 2018, so it's pretty wild to see a new version in 2026.These iPhones are even older. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus dropped all the way back in 2014, while the iPhone 5S released the year before that. As such, Apple just sent an update to 12-year-old iPhone. If you're still rocking one of these devices, that new update must be quite the surprise. It's even more than the age of the devices itself: Apple considers all three of these iPhones \"obsolete,\" as the company stopped selling them more than seven years ago. The company will not service the hardware for obsolete products, and largely omits them from future software releases. That's why this is so interesting.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's new in iOS 12.5.8iOS 12.5.8 is, of course, not a feature update, but it's also not a security update, either. Instead, Apple extended the certificate required for features like iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January of next year. These iPhones might not have seen a new feature in years, but they'll still be able to FaceTime in a year's time—and that's pretty great.It's not clear how many people are using these iPhones in 2026. But if you do, and it's working for you, Apple gave you one more reason to keep your phone for another year.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Right now, there is zero friction involved in opening Instagram or TikTok, and getting sucked into their algorithms. But add a paywall to those apps, and all of a sudden, I don't have any interest in logging on. If that sounds like it'd work on you too, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that Meta will soon test a subscription model for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The bad news is that these subscriptions won't be required to actually access the app, or the core features you already know. That will remain free, so we will remain hopelessly addicted. The details are light at the moment, especially concerning WhatsApp and Facebook. Meta told TechCrunch that the subscriptions will offer \"exclusive features\" on its apps, and will \"unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\" That will include more controls over how you share and connect with other users. Again, pretty vague. \nPerhaps part of this cloak-and-dagger approach is that Meta isn't really sure how it wants to roll out these subscriptions. The company explained to TechCrunch that it was testing a \"variety of subscription features and bundles,\" and that each app's subscription will feel unique from the others. While Meta isn't revealing much at this point, we might have a glimpse at what the company has in store for Instagram. Reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi posted on X that Instagram's paid subscription will include the option to create as many audience lists as you want, view a list of people you follow who don't follow you back, and—perhaps more enticing to some—look at another user's story without them knowing you saw it. Would you pay a monthly subscription to be able to lurk in other people's Instagram stories? (It's possible to do this already, by the way.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's another feature set that Meta plans to test subscriptions for that likely includes all three of these apps: AI features. Meta will experiment with subs for Vibes, the company's short-form AI video app built into Meta AI. The services has been free since it launched last fall, and will likely continue to be free, but Meta may charge for \"additional video creation opportunities.\" As much as I'm reluctant to say so, this really is Meta doing subscriptions right. I wouldn't pay for any of these features, but it's not like the company is taking away previously free features and locking them behind a subscription. If companies like Meta want to integrate a subscription model, they need to offer new features and abilities to justify the price. I might not think these anticipated features are worth it, but at least the current apps as they exist will remain free—even if charging for them would get me to stop using them for good. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's not the first triple-folding phone to hit the market, but since Huawei is technically banned from operating in the U.S., it's the first planned to officially arrive Stateside. Now the phone, called the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, finally has an official release date. But it also has an official price, and it's eye-watering.Folding phones have historically been pretty expensive, but with a retail price of $2,900, the Galaxy Z TriFold is nearly $1,000 more expensive that the company's current folding flagship, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Granted, being able to fold it out to a 10-inch display is kind of like stuffing a laptop in your pocket, but then, you can get an actual laptop (a really good one!) for less than half the cost.If the idea of laying down more than three grand after tax isn't deterring you, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold goes on sale on Jan. 30, and can be bought either online or in-person at one of Samsung's Experience Stores, with seven locations across California, Minnesota, New York, and Texas. If you happen to have a physical store near you, it might be worth checking in on their stock—Samsung won't be taking preorders for this phone, and despite the high price, it sold out within minutes during its South Korean launch.\nWhile Samsung does sell a 1TB model overseas, the base model will be all U.S. customers can buy at launch. This version of the TriFold comes in black and offers 512GB of storage. It's decked out with a high resolution 2,160 x 1,584 inner display, a 2520 x 1,080 outer display, the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 16GB of RAM, and a powerful 200MP main camera (although the other lenses aren't as powerful as those found on non-folding phones). And yes, the screens are both AMOLED with a 120Hz refresh rate.The novelty might be worth it for some, and I suppose if you buy the TriFold instead of a phone and a tablet separately, that could help justify the price. Still, you can get a non-folding Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,050 right now, add an iPad Pro for $899, and still save $1,000 over the cost of this new gadget.If you're on the fence, the aforementioned Samsung Experience stores do offer demos of the TriFold so you can try before you buy, although the sparse selection of locations means that won't be an option for many.More affordable folding phones than the Samsung Galaxy Z TrifoldPretty much every folding phone on the market right now is expensive, but if you must have a folding phone but you can't justify the cost of a  triple-folding model, there are other, cheaper options available.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe most obvious alternative is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is still pricey at its $2,000 retail price, though you can pay less if you can score a deal or special promotion. It'll net you most of the same specs as the TriFold, although the inner screen maxes out at 8-inches instead of 10-inches. It's still not a bad deal, since those extra two inches would come at $450 a pop. Currently, I've managed to track down an Amazon deal selling them for $1,600, although supply is limited. If you're stuck paying full price, you might instead prefer the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which starts at $1,800. That'll also give you an 8-inch inner screen, although Google's Tensor chips have a history of not being quite as strong as the Snapdragon chips that come with the Galaxy series, and the main camera is a far cry below the 200MP one found on both the Z Fold 7 and the TriFold.There are also flip phones, although these aren't really a replacement for folding phones. Instead of opening horizontally for a larger screen, they open vertically to reveal a standard phone-sized screen. In that way, they're better for portability than they are for extra features, but they are a lot cheaper—the most recent Motorola Razr is currently on sale for $400 (MSRP $700), while the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is on sale for $900 (MSRP $1,100).Finally, you might consider waiting for the rumored iPhone Fold, which is expected to come out later this year. Initial rumors put the price somewhere between $2,100 to $2,500, and while price definitely includes the Apple Tax, it's still much cheaper than the TriFold.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The 2024 Kindle Scribe is an upgraded version of Amazon's oversized e-reader designed for note-taking, offering some nice improvements over the 2022 original. Those upgrades don't come cheap, however, with prices on the 2024 Kindle Scribe starting at $399.99 for a new reader (which is still a lot less than the new-for-2025 version, which starts at $499.99).Right now, a like-new 32GB version of the 2024 Scribe is a lot cheaper: It's discounted to $260.99 (originally $377.99 and $419.99 for a new one), the lowest price this reader has seen for a refurbished model since its release, according to price-tracking tools. If you're in the market for an AI-enhanced digital notebook, this is a great opportunity to snatch one for a bargain (like-new devices still come with the same one-year warranty as a new device).\nThe original Kindle Scribe came out in 2022; that version is currently $324.99 for a like-new 32GB model with the Premium Pen, which puts how good a deal this is in perspective—you can get the three-years-newer model for less.That said, if you already have the 2022 version, there is no compelling reason to upgrade—the main difference is that the 2024 version comes with the Premium Pen instead of the Basic Pen stylus, while the tablet itself is shorter, narrower, and slimmer, but not by much (you can even still use the same case). The new screen also has texture, which will add some resistance when you're writing on it, for a more natural feel. The gap between the screen and the outer casing is also smaller. But that's where the differences end.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe 2025 model has some additional features, like AI search and OneDrive integration, that isn't yet available on the 2024 version, though Amazon promised many of those updates will arrive via a software update some time this year. Otherwise, you'll get the same book format compatibility, the same form factor, the same glare-free 300 ppi front-lit display screen, and the same 12-week battery life. If you don't own a Scribe at all and are considering getting one, the 2024 version is a good choice at the current price point—it's 38% cheaper than the new 2025 model.\n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As shiny and new as your computer was when you first bought it, eventually, developers will drop support for it. There's no telling when exactly, but at some point, you'll open an app to find a message that reads something like: \"This device does not support the latest version of this app. Please update your hardware.\"That goes for Macs, as well. You might forget that fact, since Apple's computers tend to stick around for a long time. But inevitably, the shadow of end-of-life policies comes for them, too. If you're still rocking an older Mac, I have some bad news, specifically if you use Chrome: Google is officially planning its last supported version of the browser.   Google Chrome is dropping support for macOS Monterey Google quietly announced the news in a post on the Chrome Platform Status site. The company confirmed that Chrome 150 will be the last version of the browser to support macOS 12, otherwise known as macOS Monterey. Once Google eventually releases Chrome 151, users on macOS 12 will not be able to install it, and will forever be stuck on Chrome 150. Google hasn't said when Chrome 150 will actually drop (we're currently on Chrome 143), but MacRumors estimates it'll be sometime in mid-2026, based on past releases.\nBefore you panic, know there are a couple caveats here. First, Chrome will not stop working on macOS 12 once version 151 drops. You'll still be able to use Chrome as you always have. In fact, you might not even notice the difference, minus any new features and changes that Google rolls out in future software versions. You will see an alert that your browser is out of date, but it'll still get you to YouTube, Gmail, and Lifehacker.This version of macOS is also fairly outdated. Google isn't just picking last year's macOS version, or the one before that. We're currently on macOS 26, which for these purposes, could be read as macOS 16. It's the fourth version of macOS since Monterey, meaning unless you know your Mac is running macOS 12, there's a good chance you're running something that Chrome still supports. If you aren't sure, click the Apple in the top-left corner, then choose \"About This Mac.\" Here, you'll find the macOS version next to \"macOS.\"Security concerns with using Chrome on macOS 12Let's say your Mac is running macOS 12. If so, you really should stop using Chrome once version 151 drops. That's because you'll no longer receive Google's latest security updates for the browser, which puts your machine (and its data) at risk. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce Chrome 150 drops, bad actors will look for security vulnerabilities in the code to exploit. Google will do the same, and will patch any it or any third-party researchers find. Once 151 comes out, it'll include those patches, but Chrome 150 users will be left behind. The risk only grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered, and new versions of Chrome come out. As such, you have a couple of options if you're running macOS 12. The first is to update your OS, if you have that choice. If your Mac does support macOS 13 or newer, updating will open you up to new versions of Chrome. Of course, perhaps the reason you're running macOS 12 is because you cannot update. While that largely affects Macs that are at least 10 years old, there are still plenty of these machines out there. There are alternative ways to update your older Mac, even if Apple won't let you, such as with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, but that might be too technical a route for some. The other option here is to stop using Chrome, and switch to a browser that does support macOS 12. Firefox, for example, supports macOS 10.15 or later, and Microsoft Edge fully supports macOS 12 and later. (Safari itself hasn't been updated on macOS 12 since July 2024.) It isn't fun watching your tech grow old, but you don't need to chuck your Mac just because Chrome will end support this year—even if the newest ones are really good. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This is a real risk for a lot of people, especially if you are sedentary and have certain health conditions. Here's a breakdown of what’s so dangerous about shoveling, and who's most at risk. Snow shoveling is hard exerciseThe connection between shoveling and cardiac events is real: The American Heart Association cites several studies that found higher rates of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths after snowstorms. Shoveling is hard work, and it can cause your blood pressure and heart rate to rise far higher than levels that are considered safe for sedentary people with heart conditions. Cold temperatures also seem to make chest pain more likely, possibly because your arteries can constrict in the cold.Who should check with a doctor before shoveling?You may have heard the advice to check with a doctor before beginning an exercise program. I have more information on that here: Most people don’t need to check with a doctor, but that depends on your medical history and on whether you intend to do intense exercise. Since snow shoveling is intense exercise, it’s worth taking a look at those guidelines. If you have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or kidney disease, and are currently not exercising intensely, you should check with a doctor before you start. That’s true whether the intense exercise you want to do is running, Crossfit, or shoveling six inches of snow from your driveway. Pushing a snowblower counts, tooOne surprising thing: The cautions around shoveling snow also apply to using a snowblower. Snowblowing turns out to also be serious exercise, even if, in theory, it should be easier because a machine is doing part of the work. How to reduce your risk of heart attackIn a news release from the American Heart Association, the cardiologist who was the lead author on a paper on risks of exercise recommends that certain people should not do their own shoveling. This includes: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPeople who have had bypass surgery or coronary angioplastyPeople who have already had a heart attack or strokeCurrent and former smokersPeople who have diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterolPeople who are sedentaryObviously, advice from an internet article is not the same as medical advice from your doctor, so please defer to actual medical expertise. And if you’re healthy enough that shoveling snow is reasonably safe, you may still want to take a few precautions to make shoveling easier on your body. By the way, even though running a snowblower is hard work, it’s still usually easier on your body than shoveling. And if you need to shovel, pushing a shovel is easier on your body than lifting it repeatedly. I would add that it’s a game changer to shovel multiple times in a single snowstorm. Instead of waiting until you have six inches of snow on the ground, go out when there’s just two inches and it’ll be a breeze. Repeat that process two more times, and you’ll have a clear driveway without ever having to wrestle with ankle-deep snow. Finally, be aware of how your body is feeling as you shovel, and stop if you don’t feel well. Or as the AHA put it: \"If you experience chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or heart palpitations or irregular heart rhythms stop the activity immediately. Call 9-1-1 if symptoms don’t subside shortly after snow removal.\"\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users. There are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.  The main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag. \nWhat you need to take full advantage of the new AirTagAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags. Even if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)If you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBuy an older AirTag if you don't meet these specificationsApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags. That's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.If you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you’re always sore (or, worse, injured) after the first big storm of the season, read these tips on how to make shoveling easier on your body.Recognize what you’re asking your body to doLook, just because shoveling is a common chore doesn’t mean it’s one that everyone’s body is automatically ready for. Be honest about whether you’re trained for this. You wouldn’t ask “how can I run a marathon without my legs being sore the next day?” if you haven’t done any running at all in the past year. Jumping into something you’re not ready for is going to suck.If you know you’ll be shoveling a lot, plan ahead. Deadlifts in the gym will help you build the strength you need in your back, core, and legs, for example. If you’re not up for that, any full body fitness regime will leave you better prepared than doing nothing. \nAnd while we’re mostly talking about sore muscles and aching joints, it’s important to recognize whether your cardiovascular system is up to the task. If you aren’t used to exercising, and if you are older or have a heart condition, you may want to check with your doctor about whether shoveling poses a risk to your heart.Shovel early and oftenIf I could give the world only one snow-shoveling hack, it is this: Shovel when there is only a small amount of snow, even if you know there’s more coming. It’s far, far easier on your body to shovel three inches of snow four times over the course of the day, than to tackle 12 inches of snow all at once. If you missed your opportunity, you can still shovel in layers. Take a slice off the top, then a slice that goes deeper, and so on. Each shovelful will be much lighter and easier to deal with, even though you are taking more shovelfuls in total.Push instead of liftWe tend to envision shoveling as a repetitive bend-and-lift movement, but don’t forget that you can also use your shovel as a snowplow to push the snow in front of you. You can even buy shovels that are meant to be used this way, so consider an upgrade. Pushing the snow works best when it’s in a thin layer, so this works well with the advice to shovel when there’s only a small amount on the ground. But even if you have deep snow, pushing can save you some effort. Push until you have a pile, and then slice off the pile in layers.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep your back straightYou’ve heard the advice to lift heavy boxes “with your legs, not your back.” What this really means is that your back is best protected from injury when you can keep it straight. If your back rounds as it gets tired, take a break, or find a technique that allows you to keep your back straight even while it’s tired. For example, it’s most efficient to shovel in a deadlift-like motion: Your back is more or less straight, and you’re hingeing from your hips like a drinky bird. This does require a lot of work from your lower back muscles, so you are technically lifting “with your back,” but it’s safe as long as your back muscles are strong enough to keep your torso straight and stable. As your back muscles get tired, you may find it easier to keep your back straight if you keep it more upright. This is where a squat motion comes in—the proverbial lifting “with your legs.” Choke up on the shovel so the weight is as close to your body as possible, and bend your knees more so that you don’t have to bend as much from the hips.Warm up, take breaks, and go easy on yourselfDon’t kid yourself: This is a workout. And as with any workout, the first 10 to 15 minutes will feel the hardest. So keep the work light at first—take smaller shovelfuls, for example. Don’t forget to take breaks, either. You’re not cheating if you stop for a few minutes to let your body rest before getting back into it.Switching techniques (as above) and positions can help to distribute the strain across your body rather than just hammering the same muscles over and over. Do half your shoveling with the shovel on your right side, and half with the shovel to your left. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That deal runs for the next six days (or until it sells out), and Prime members get free shipping. It includes a 90-day limited warranty through Woot, which is shorter than JBL’s standard coverage but still decent. That said, it ships without a charging brick or USB-C cable, which feels like an oversight at this price.\nJBL didn’t overhaul the design here. The Charge 6 keeps the durable, travel-friendly build that made the Charge 5 so popular, with IP68 dust- and water-resistance and a new looped handle for better grip. Internally, the upgrade is real. A 2.1-by-3.7-inch woofer and 0.8-inch tweeter push out 45 watts of power, backed by those familiar side radiators that give it surprisingly strong bass for its size. It’s not going to rival a subwoofer, but for a pool party or small outdoor hang, it holds its own with clean, full sound that doesn’t distort at a high volume, according to this PCMag review.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBattery life is rated up to 24 hours depending on how hard you push it, and the speaker can even charge your phone using the USB-C port, which now also supports lossless audio when connected directly. Bluetooth 5.4 is on board, and JBL added support for Auracast—useful if you want to pair speakers or join public streams. The app offers a seven-band EQ for people who like to tinker, but codec support is limited to SBC and AAC, which means no aptX or LDAC if you care about high-res streaming. Still, this is a powerful speaker made for people who spend more time outdoors than in, and $129.95 is the lowest it’s been so far for a new-in-box unit, according to price-trackers.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If your alerts from messaging apps are too loud, you can either put the Mac in do-not-disturb mode to mute those alerts, or lower the system volume, but that's it. It's not ideal, since lowering system volume also impacts media volume, which can sometimes make it hard to listen to music or hear dialogue in TV shows or movies. If you could separately toggle volume levels per app, that would be ideal. Fortunately, some third-party apps allow you to do this, and this guide highlights the best of them.FineTune: A free Mac app for per-app sound control\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nA free app that lets you lower or mute alert tones while maintaining media volume, FineTune is good enough for most people. It's open-source, and has a few simple sliders that let you control each app's volume level. My previous pick for this job—BackgroundMusic—no longer works well, as it hasn't been updated in a while. FineTune's come in to fill that gap nicely, and it does what it says on the tin.Once you install the app, you can click its menu bar icon to finetune any individual app's volume. When an app starts playing audio on your Mac, it'll appear in FineTune's interface. And once you're done moving your sliders to change volume levels, you'll quickly discover a couple of other useful features, such as controlling the volume levels of each of your output device (speakers, headphones, etc.), and an equalizer for each app on your computer. You can also send audio from one app to a specific speaker or headphone. I've used these features to lower my AirPods' volume while keeping my Mac's speaker louder, and to set a bass-friendly EQ preset on those AirPods. You can play around with these tools to get the job done according to your needs, too.\nFineTune also has a convenient volume boost feature, which lets you increase the volume up to 400% on a per-app basis. This is good for files where the volume levels are almost inaudible, but I'd be choosy about how you use it.SoundSource: A paid app for advanced volume control\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nMost people will be happy with FineTune's feature set and lack of a price tag. However, if you need an app that can control AirPlay devices in your house, send audio to multiple devices at once, enable a per-app EQ with two dozen presets, set a preferred device order for audio output, and much more, then you should consider SoundSource 6 ($49). The app's been around for over a decade, and the newest version released towards the end of 2025.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWith SoundSource, the basic functionality lets you control the audio levels of each app, but it also has a few other neat touches. My favorite feature is the one that lets you mute all sound effects with just one click. I'm not sure about you, but alert sounds from messaging apps tend to make me a bit anxious. Some of my friends tend to send multiple short texts at once, too, which makes my Mac's speaker go off like a siren. I've tried putting my Mac on do-not-disturb mode, but that hides those alerts altogether, which isn't ideal either. Ever since I got SoundSource, I've just muted all sound effects. This lets me receive notifications without the annoying tones, and it allows me to watch movies sans interruptions from alert tones.You can also group multiple devices in SoundSource, and send audio to all of them at once, which is an easy way to create a multi-room audio setup. Of course, you can't have your audio 100% in sync, so don't get your hopes up about creating a surround sound system with five cheap Bluetooth speakers. However, it's good enough if you just want to have music playing in every room of your house while you cook, clean, or just move around. SoundSource's support for AirPlay devices means that you can send audio to your HomePod and other AirPlay devices like TVs or speakers, too.SoundSource also has granular controls for various features. As an example, you can set up a keyboard shortcut to increase or decrease your microphone's volume, or to mute the mic altogether. Another interesting feature lets you set up a mute timer, which sets the volume to zero for up to 2 minutes for specific apps or output devices. It's clear by now that SoundSource has lots of great features under the hood, which is amazing for power users, but probably overkill for anyone who just wants to set separate volume levels for a couple apps. The good news is that SoundSource offers a free trial that lets you use all of its features for up to 20 minutes at a time, so you can try it out to see if it's worth buying.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The campaign, known as GhostPoster, was identified by Koi Security in December and included 17 Firefox add-ons designed to monitor users' browsing activity. Threat actors planted malicious JavaScript code in the extension's PNG logo, which served as a malware loader to retrieve the main payload from a remote server. Researchers at LayerX have found an additional 17 malicious extensions across multiple browsers that have collectively been installed more than 840,000 times. Ongoing GhostPoster malware campaignAccording to the report from LayerX, GhostPoster initially targeted Microsoft Edge and then expanded to Chrome and Firefox. The malicious add-ons may have been active as early as 2020 and include the following: \nGoogle Translate in Right Click Translate Selected Text with GoogleAds Block UltimateFloating Player – PiP Mode Convert Everything Youtube Download One Key Translate AdBlocker Save Image to Pinterest on Right ClickInstagram Downloader RSS Feed Cool Cursor Full Page Screenshot Amazon Price History Color Enhancer Translate Selected Text with Right ClickPage Screenshot Clipper\"Google Translate in Right Click\" alone had 522,398 installs. The next most popular add-on was \"Translate Selected Text with Google\" with 159,645 installs. Researchers also found a more sophisticated variant of the campaign in \"Instagram Downloader,\" which had 3,822 installs. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGhostPoster malware has built-in safeguards to prevent detection—for example, activation is delayed by 48 hours, and it only communicates with remote attack servers under certain conditions. Once installed, though, extensions that are part of GhostPoster have the ability to hijack affiliate traffic (and redirect commissions to attackers), strip and inject HTTP headers to weaken security, bypass CAPTCHA, and inject iframes and scripts for click fraud and user tracking. The only sort-of good news is that the malware doesn't harvest credentials or engage in phishing. While the malicious extensions are no longer available to add in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, users who have them installed should remove them immediately, as they remain active until explicitly deleted. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

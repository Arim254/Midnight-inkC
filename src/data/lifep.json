    "body": "\n        \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Zooey Liao/Lifehacker/Getty Images\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Scammers frequently target shoppers who are looking for a good deal or a rare find (or both). As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.  Lookalike domains contain malicious contentThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes. In some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware. Infoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to avoid parked domain scamsOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site. I've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: verona studio - Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        There are a lot of methods to try in the never-ending quest for a way to sort through and slim down our bulging inboxes. They're different enough that there's certainly one out there that matches or comes close to matching your exact needs, but they do all have one thing in common: They rely on the chronology of when each email came in. Let’s try turning that approach on its head, and instead, sort by sender to weed through the mess.Why you should sort your inbox by senderWhen purging your messages, you probably have an organizational system you follow, like the 4Ds. You go through and decide what gets deleted, done, delegated, or deferred—but there’s not much pattern recognition if you’re just starting at the top and working your way down. Every day's demands or outreach might look different depending on what you have going on at that time. Sorting your inbox by sender instead of most recent helps you see whose (or what) messages you receive most. If it’s a newsletter or mailing list, you can delete them all in one go, but if it’s a specific person at work, you might get a signal that they tend to need a response from you. From there, you can prioritize their emails, maybe adding them as a favorite contact or paying special attention for new correspondence from them, since you know their messages are more consequential than others. Even if you're using the one- or two-touch methods, which call on you to open every single email the moment you get it, this can be helpful because you'll feel a sense of urgency around specific senders once you identify the patterns. So instead of deleting or delegating emails one by one, you can try nuking or dealing with entire batches from certain senders to make the sorting process faster. How to sort by sender in GmailIn Gmail, if you’ve already found a message from the person or entity whose emails you want to bundle up, you can right-click it from your inbox and hit “find emails from.” This brings you to an inbox only of messages from that sender. You can also access this inbox by typing “from:[their email address]” in the search bar, or clicking the advanced search button  and entering their name into the “from” field.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, you can’t sort your entire Gmail inbox by sender, and instead can only make bundles sender by sender, but it still helps with batching them up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sort by sender in OutlookOutlook is better than Gmail for this method. In fact, it allows you to sort your entire inbox not only by sender, but by other recipients, size, and more.At the top of the inbox, hit “Filter,” then “Sort by.” Depending on what version you’re running, you may have to go into the “View” tab and hit “From” in the Arrangement group. The emails will line up in your inbox by sender, making them easy to bundle and delete.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Anker's Soundcore Sleep A20 are exactly that: earbuds designed to block out excess noise without pressing uncomfortably against your ear. I've been using them for a year and can't recommend them enough. Right now, these sleep earbuds are on sale for $107.99 (originally $179.99)—that is the lowest price they've been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe Sleep A20 are not active noise-cancelling earbuds, which is how they're able to have such a small, unobtrusive form factor. Instead, they use the in-ear seal to create a natural noise blocker, which, in my opinion, works well enough to block out sounds. They fit quite comfortably and don't press against your ear when you sleep on your side. Very rarely do I wake up with one of them lost in the covers after falling off during the night, but it does happen occasionally (you can use the Find Device feature, which emits a loud sound through the earbuds). The battery life is 14 hours on sleep mode, which includes sounds from the Soundcore app (think white noise or relaxing sounds). If you have it in Bluetooth mode, where you can listen to Spotify or whatever else you want, the battery will last eight hours, but the charging case gives it a total life of up to 80 hours between plug-ins.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe companion app is great, with many useful features for sleeping. You can turn your earbuds off after a set amount of time, have a sleep tracker that records your sleep data, a smart volume feature that increases or decreases in volume depending on the sound in your room, full EQ, and other features. \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

With this management system, you take the time to read an email first, then act on it however you need to—if you need to, that is—before either filing it away somewhere or deleting it. That’s basically all there is to it, but it works because it requires you to focus on each individual email and make an assessment right away, so you don’t miss anything.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nLike the one- and two-touch rules, this one does require you to open your emails as they come in. For me, that's the hardest part because it's a habit you need to build. This approach reminds me of a more broadly-applicable productivity technique I use often, which is the two-minute rule. When you think of something or are prompted to deal with it, handle it right away. Again, it's a habit that needs to be built up, but I like this approach for all kinds of productivity needs—and with RAFT, you have a clearly outlined series of next steps after you open it up. How to get the most out of RAFTTo maximize the benefits, you should combine this with another system or two. For instance, combine RAFT with the LIFO—last in, first out—method, which calls for you to answer your most recent emails before older ones. If you do this, you’ll always be acting on the most urgent needs instead of playing endless catch-up with things that you let slip by. If something from the past is truly important, you’ll get a follow-up email and you can RAFT then. Otherwise, stick with your most pressing, recent messages and read them, act on them, and file or trash them after that.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes to the acting part, you can call on the trusty 4D method to help you out. The four Ds are delete, do, delegate, or defer, and they refer to the four things you can do with any email. (Delete here is redundant, since “trash” is part of RAFT, but it’s good to reinforce the notion that useless emails should be nuked.) Either do what the email says or delegate it to someone who can, but keep the process moving swiftly. If you don’t end up forwarding it to someone else, delete it or defer (file) it. The main rule of RAFT is you have to do something with every message, not ignore it. As for the filing component of RAFT, make sure you have a great file system in place in advance. If you use Gmail, consider using labels as a more organized archive system, to make whatever you choose to file away more easily accessible. You can label these mini-archives by date, by project, or by whatever makes sense for your retrieval, but be consistent about it so you’re not just banishing all your dealt-with messages to an email limbo. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

These horrors will visit you at all hours of the day, making it harder to spot the truly important messages in your inbox—and it gets worse once you've gotten fed up enough to disable push notifications and they start to really pile up. It’s time to banish these buggers. And, if you're using Gmail, there’s an easy way to do it.Use filters to manage mailing list emails in GmailYou can use a third-party add-on to go through your mailing lists and unsubscribe, saying goodbye to newsletters and e-blasts. But you know what’s easier and less expensive? Setting a filter in Gmail. Open up one of your mailing list emails and click the three dots in the menu bar. You’ll see “Mark as unread,” “Mark as important,” and a few other options, but the one you want is “Filter messages like these.”\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Gmail\n                    \n    \nFrom there, you’ll see a dialog box asking how you want to filter your messages. You can filter by sender, recipients, and subjects, but also by anything that “has the words…” In the “has the words” row, type “unsubscribe.” \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, any email containing the word “unsubscribe”—which reputable email blasts almost always do—can be filtered out of your inbox without you having to do anything. Once you type “unsubscribe” there, hit the “create filter” button. The following dialog box will ask how you want these filtered. You can choose to have them archived, marked as read, starred, forwarded, or immediately deleted.Things to consider when creating Gmail filtersI recommend archiving over deleting in case you ever want to find them again, but if you are sure you’ll never want to open another mailing list, newsletter, or sales blast, feel free to check the box next to “delete.” Note that if you choose to archive but later want to delete them, you’ll have to do so manually. Personally, I am happy to pay for extra Google storage to keep a record of messages instead of inadvertently lose something I need, but I know that's needlessly neurotic. If you do end up archiving those, the next step needs to be actually unsubscribing from the messages you truly don't want to receive. Gmail has recently made this a lot easier: You can usually click an unsubscribe button up at the top of the offending email. The Google-run email service also rolled out a Manage Subscriptions service this past summer, so once you take a gander at the archive full of junk and notice what you're not exactly needing or opening up, you can head over there and nuke your subscriptions quickly and easily. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whatever your reasons, you’re in need of a last-minute gift, and your options are limited. If you're reading this at a time when it's too late for online delivery, and in-person store options are already closed, then all that’s left is the glory of your local 24-hour drug store.If you have access to a major chain like Walgreens or CVS, you could be in surprisingly good shape for this last-minute gift. All it takes is a little ingenuity to level up this gift from \"a protein bar\" to \"a gym bro collection,\" or \"some loose nail polish\" to a \"curated at-home spa day.\"Following this logic, I’ve carefully categorized your gift options into three tiers. The first is for gift-givers willing to shell out a little extra cash in their panic in order to create something somewhat personalized. The second tier includes single-item purchases that are simply passable gift options. The third tier is a warning.Tier one: DIY signature collectionsLike a chef turning baskets of mystery ingredients into a three-course meal on Chopped, this category of gifts is all about your innovation. In these DIY arrangements, the sum is greater than its parts, which should all be available at most chain drug stores. Here are some of our ideas for themed collections, but feel free to customize at your convenience.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nMovie night: Popcorn. Funky popcorn toppings. Candy. Hot chocolate. Fuzzy socks. A little slip of paper with your Netflix login. You can’t go wrong with a cozy movie-night theme.Treat yo’ self: Think spa day materials, like face masks, nail polish, and bath bombs. Throw in a candle to help set the pampering vibe.Health and wellness: Browse around for gummy vitamins, supplements, protein powder, and whatever else catches your eye in the fitness aisle. Be warned: This one can quickly get expensive. The Jetsetter: Pick from the array of travel-sized must-haves, including ear plugs and perhaps even a neck pillow (with a note about how to wear it right). The Techie: Head to the electronics section and go wild with whatever gadgets are available and within your price range. Portable chargers and speakers are quality gifts in their own right. Tier two: It’s the thought that countsThese items aren’t necessarily bad gifts, but many will be easily detected as a last-minute purchase. The success of tier two drug store gifts will come down to the charm of the gift-giver and the chill factor of the recipient.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGift cardsCandlesCosmetic bagsTherapeutic massagerJewelryInsulated mugsCalendars or plannersNotebooksCoffee/tea bundlesWine and a corkscrew (depending on your state’s liquor laws)Picture framesElectronics, like ear buds or portable chargersTier three: “Gifts” that will do more harm than goodHey, buddy. All is lost, huh? Personally, I recommend a white lie about an imaginary gift that didn’t arrive in time.

Just as the Nintendo Switch introduced the world to console gaming on the go, the Steam Deck was the pioneer in bringing PC gaming to a handheld form factor—even if it pushes the definition of \"handheld.\" Part of the initial appeal of the Steam Deck is its price: While you could choose a souped-up model with an OLED display and expanded internal storage, you could also pick up an LCD model with a 256GB SSD at a reasonable $399. For less than the price of a Switch 2, you could have something that plays the entire Steam library, with its huge variation in games. It's a great deal—perhaps too great. If you go to Valve's official Steam Deck site, and scroll down to see your hardware choices, you'll notice something interesting: While there appear to be many 512GB and 1TB OLED Steam Decks in stock, ready to buy, the entry-level LCD model is \"out of stock.\" Hardware selling out isn't uncommon, of course—other popular devices like the Switch 2 sell out fast, and can sometimes be hard to come by. The assumption then is that Valve will make more LCD Steam Decks, so that gamers can buy into the platform without spending the extra $150 for the 512GB OLED model. However, it doesn't appear that the LCD Steam Deck is coming back anytime soon—or at all. While it's easy to miss if you're just looking at the buy links themselves, scroll down a bit further on Valve's site, and you'll see the following footnote: \"We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.\" And seeing as the item is currently listed as out of stock, it seems fair to say that the LCD Steam Deck is no more. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nValve doesn't have an official reason why it is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but some speculate the root cause is rising component prices—namely, RAM and storage costs. These computing parts are skyrocketing in price, which might lead companies like Valve to pare down its hardware selection. Why waste expensive resources on a $399 machine, when you could instead push some of those potential buyers into the $549 machine?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCan you buy the LCD Steam Deck elsewhere?The short answer? Yes, but I'd encourage you not to. The most reliable seller to purchase a Steam Deck from is Valve itself. Otherwise, you may either overpay for your Steam Deck, or, potentially, get scammed. Take this Amazon listing, for example where the model appears to be $459.99. The seller has misspelled the name of the device, and has labeled it under \"Apparel.\" While it might be tempting to save $90 when compared to the official 512GB OLED model, I'd skip the Amazon option. Another questionable Amazon seller has the 256GB model for $829.99, while selling the 512GB OLED model for $899.99. Again, that's either highway robbery, or a good old fashioned scam. If you're dead set on not spending $549 on a new Steam Deck, you could look at the used market, but even then, things are rough. People aren't really selling these things, and when they are, they're selling them for quite a bit. You might have some luck on a site like eBay, where I'm currently seeing some OLED Steam Decks selling around $400. But buyer beware: Buying items used through a third-party seller can be risky. Without the proper safety nets, you might be better off stretching for the official hardware from Valve. \n            \n    ",

When emails pile up, you start overthinking what you need to do—I know I do, anyway. But if you pare down your options to the most basic and straightforward ones, it'll help ease your decision paralysis and keep you on top of things. That's what the \"four Ds,\" or the 4D method, does. It’s easy to remember and easy to implement, which makes it helpful for anyone who has a pile of emails to contend with every day. Here’s how to follow it.What is the 4D method of inbox management?This method of managing your overflowing inbox has been around quite a while and rests on quick decision-making to help you easily weed through it all. Time-tested, it works—but only if you get what you’re supposed to do.4D stands for, obviously, four “D” words:Delete the emailDo what the email saysDelegate what the email wants you to doDefer it\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThose are easy to remember and, once you get the hang of calling them to mind, easy to do. Proponents of the method, like Aleksandra Brzeska, business development manager at XTRF Translation Management System, say this works as long as you adhere to it. Here’s how to put it in action.How to use the 4D method of inbox management4D is similar to the one-touch rule. In fact, it relies on it, but takes it a step further. When using the one-touch rule, you make a decision about the email as soon as you open it up, but with that one, your focus is simply opening it the moment it comes in. For these techniques to work, you have to be opening every email, or at least looking at it and identifying from the subject line whether it’s worth opening. So, first things first, you’ll need to designate a time every day to sort through all your communications. Use timeboxing to block out time every morning, for example, to get this done. Make email management a core part of your daily to-do list when you use a method like the 3-3-3 list. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it’s time to go through your messages every day, set out to make a choice about each one, referring to the four options above. If it’s irrelevant, spam, or won’t ever require a follow-up, delete it. If it calls for a task that is doable right now, you’re responsible, and/or it’s pretty urgent, just do it. If it’s a less urgent task for someone else in your department or could be handled by another person without overloading them, delegate it and forward it their way. If it’s something that could or should be handled in the near future but doesn’t require immediate action, defer it by archiving it, putting it in a folder, or starring it.When this is done, go back through once more and archive or delete anything that’s now been done or delegated, clearing out your inbox for the next wave of messages. The benefit of using this method is that it makes decision-making simple, quick, and actionable, plus keeps your inbox low or close to zero. Removing unnecessary choices or procrastination streamlines the process and keeps you moving in just one of four ways, ensuring everything gets done or removed from your plate. \n            \n    ",

IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network. As GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution. Check your IP address for suspicious activityTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure). \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps. As BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It’s increasingly challenging to find even basic models without some kind of “smart” feature or embedded artificial intelligence. If you don't believe me, just try to find a “dumb” television at your local Best Buy. You will be disappointed.While it's true that many of the “smart” features offered by these nifty new appliances are quite useful. The ability to pre-heat your oven or adjust your thermostat by pressing a button on your phone is great, and getting alerts when the fridge door is left open or when you forget to move your laundry from the washer to the dryer is undeniably a boon. But sometimes, the convenience these features offer is an illusion, as many supposedly smart features in modern appliances aren’t very smart at all—and they can actively make your life harder instead of easier. If you’re shopping for a new appliance, considering avoiding these not-so-smart features.Dryer with moisture sensors that leave your clothes dampModern clothes dryers offer a lot of great capabilities. Some can even talk to your washer, pre-setting themselves for the laundry coming its way, and many can remind you to collect your laundry, sparing you wrinkled clothes, and to clean out the lint filter. But modern dryers often come with moisture sensors that shut off the dryer when it detects that your clothes are dry. In theory, sensor drying saves you money and time over a fixed time dry. But the sensors in these dryers are notorious for being inaccurate shutting the dryer down when your clothes are still a bit damp. And you still have to make a guess as to how much drying you need and set the sensor to the proper level. At best, this can mean running another drying cycle. At worst, your clothes will sit there getting mildewy until you remember to check the machine.Dishwashers with \"eco modes\" that leave dishes dirty\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nNew dishwashers often come with efficient or “eco” modes that use less water and less energy to clean your dishes. That’s a great idea—in theory. But these modes achieve those efficiencies the only way they can: By running at lower temperatures and literally using less water in their cleaning cycles. This can often leave your dishes visibly dirty after running a load, forcing you to cancel out the benefit by running them a second time. Worse, these modes don’t get hot enough to kill dangerous bacteria like E. coli, so even if your dishes come out looking clean, they may not be sanitary.Smart fridges that misidentify your groceriesSmart fridges are often at the top of people’s complaints list for two main reasons: One, they are often abandoned by their manufacturers soon after they arrive on the market, with updates and support vanishing in as quickly as two years. That transforms your pricey smart fridge into a pricey dumb fridge. More frustratingly, smart fridges that supposedly use artificial intelligence to identify your groceries as you place them inside (in order to help you track your shopping needs and expiration dates) often get things wrong. For example, this woman complained that her smart fridge often mistook her husband’s head for an avocado, among other problems, which rendered the feature worse than useless.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSensor-cooking microwaves that don't cookWhile the modern microwave remains the steadfastly boxy, unsexy beast it’s always been, there have been attempts to make it smarter—and sometimes these attempts backfire on you. Some microwaves offer “sensor cooking,” the ability to sense the weight and moisture level of the food in order to adjust cooking time and power levels to cook your food perfectly. Except when it senses incorrectly and leaves you with a half-cooked mess, or if you’re trying to cook something that simply doesn't work well with sensor cooking, like dry foods that don’t produce enough steam for the sensor to detect.Smart kitchen scales that are just making guessesA smart kitchen scale might seem like a nifty idea; you weigh your food and use an app to get nutritional information, like the amount of calories in what you’re about to eat. That’s fine, but it really just adds an unnecessary step to your cooking routine, because most “smart” scales are just regular, standard kitchen scales and an app that Googles on your behalf. You’ll get the same general experience—and likely better accuracy—by weighing something and using your phone to search for nutritional information yourself.Smart garage doors that are less secureSmart garage doors are a great example of a piece of technology that isn’t improved much by being smart. And the core technology that makes the garage door smart—a WiFi connection to a cloud server—can also make it worse than useless. Aside from the fact that any disruption in the door’s connection can cause it to remain locked in the open position, leaving your home vulnerable, there’s also the fact that the manufacturer can make changes any time they like that could potentially alter the way your door functions or brick it entirely.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Not only do endless emails bog you down and keep you stuck in a loop of endless replies, but the stress of even having to wade through both the important messages and the junk is enough to make you avoid your inbox altogether. There's a reason \"answer emails\" is always the example I use for a tedious-but-important task when I'm explaining more complicated, detailed productivity techniques.But there are smaller techniques you can apply directly to email management, too. To stay on top of your work, school, and personal correspondence, you need a productivity plan, but it doesn't have to be intense: You can try the simple “touch” rules of inbox management.Start reframing how you think of every email you get and consider them each an immediate priority. Crucially, I only mean the email itself is a priority; if you think too hard about this, you'll get overwhelmed fast. You don’t have to do whatever task is outlined in it the moment it arrives, but you do have to open it. The “one-touch” rule is similar to the “two-minute” rule of productivity in that way: A task that takes less than two minutes to complete should be done right away.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nOpen the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. This method works best for people who get a lot of emails that aren’t necessary to respond to, like all-staff updates. The goal is to touch it once instead of coming back to it repeatedly and deliberating if and when you’ll respond or deal with it or instead of procrastinating, never opening it, and being unaware of its contents (or even existence) when you actually need to know what it said. Open it, take in the information, send feedback if necessary, and be done with it.The two-touch ruleIf you tend to have a lot of emails that need a response and the one-touch rule isn't working well, you can move on to a “two-touch” method to clear your mind and be more productive. On the first touch of the email, decide if you need to respond to it right away (making it one-touch) or it’s something that can or should be responded to later in the week.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse your email service’s flagging or snoozing functions to categorize it, so it is available to you easily when you’re ready to respond. Your first touch is still opening it right away—that’s key. Letting emails pile up is overwhelming, but opening them right away will help you maintain peace in your inbox. Designating a specific time to respond to non-urgent messages will also free you up to be more productive, as you’ll know you’ll get it done and won’t feel it weighing on you. Make sure you schedule time into your week to circle back on the flagged emails. Try building a 3-3-3 list to manage your to-dos, designating one of your three medium-sized or small tasks to opening all those saved messages.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.These are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed. Tactical door-closed push-ups (10-15 reps)These are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.Spite squats (20 reps)Do some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking. Frustration lunges (10 per leg)Lunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes! \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.Diplomatic plank hold (30-60 seconds)Hold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPassive-aggressive mountain climbers (30 seconds)Quick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor. Peacekeeper glute bridges (15-20 reps)Lie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.Zen bicycle crunches (20 total)Finish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center. Cool downSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.\n            ",

I make a handful of new, curated, choreographed ones for the spin classes I teach every week and otherwise meticulously maintain quarterly playlists designed to represent the overall vibe of specific, three-month periods in my life. I only edit those during the 12 weeks of the quarter, then leave them alone so I can revisit them and relive the era. This means I am constantly fiddling with the present playlist to make it just right, searching for songs that feel precisely aligned with however I'm feeling. It's actually a time-consuming hobby—but I stumbled across a feature the other day that has made creating spin playlists and soundtracking Q1 of 2026 easier than ever. The best way I can describe the feature I stumbled upon is that it's like Tinder for songs. If you're listening to a song within the app, scroll down. Go past the buttons for Play and Next, past the About the artist section, past the lyrics, and stop when you see Explore [artist name]. Then, you'll have three options like Similar to [artist name] and Similar to [song name], but these can differ slightly. Tapping one of those opens up the new feature. Say you choose Similar to [song name]. You'll be given 30 seconds of a song that Spotify's algorithm considers \"similar\" to the one you were just listening to, plus the artist's name, how many Spotify followers they have, and a three-dot menu that will let you add the song to your likes, add it to a playlist, go to the artist's page, and more. If you like the 30-second clip, you can add the song to your playlists. If not, you can keep swiping downward to hear a new one. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSee how it's like Tinder? You make fairly snap decisions based on the quick preview and few details you get, then swipe away if you don't like it. I found a community forum post on Spotify's website about it, but otherwise, not much chatter. All I can tell is that it's been out since about May. Why I like the featureI prefer this to the other music-discovery options on Spotify because it gives you a quick preview of the song and makes the finding process simple. I am, of course, a big fan of the pre-generated Discover Weekly playlist or New Releases playlist Spotify makes for me every week, but it's time-consuming to listen to all the songs in them and it's not intuitive to find other new songs based on the finite playlists themselves. The 30-second quick hits and easy, swipeable dismissal of the new feature help me figure out if a song is worth my time, either for spin class or personal use, add it to the appropriate playlist if so, and keep moving. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat I especially like is the three hashtags under the artist's name. They are genre descriptions that match up with whatever song you're previewing and I've found them helpful because I have a hard time describing what kind of music I even like. Apparently, per the new feature, I like something called \"speed garage.\" Tapping the #speedgarage hashtag that appears in the song previews brings me to another scrollable preview pane full of, exclusively, more speed garage—whatever that actually is. I still can't define it, but I learned I like it, and that alone is more beneficial than a year's worth of Discover Weekly playlists. I used this feature during my Uber ride to the airport the other day and, by the time I was through TSA, I had 29 new songs in my Q1 playlist. I listened to them on the plane, weeded out ones that didn't match the quarterly vibe well enough, then sent it to my friends, who all gave the collection rave reviews like, and I quote, \"this slaps.\" \n            \n    ",

The deal includes the new console with the new Mario Kart for the same price as the standalone console. You can get this one for $449 (down from $499)—the lowest price it has reached yet, according to price-tracking tools. (Note that you can only see the price once you've signed in and it's in your cart, as Nintendo restricts retailers from promoting anything below the \"minimum advertised price\" of $499.) To top it off, Best Buy is somehow promising to have it delivered to your home by 9 p.m. tonight, Dec. 24—a true Christmas miracle. Not all locations will be available, so make sure you see the \"shipping get it by 9 p.m. today\" note above \"add to cart.\" You can also pick it up within an hour if time is of the essence.\nThis bundle deal is great, and likely the best one you'll see for quite some time, judging by Nintendo's previous deals. To put it into perspective, the OLED edition of the original Nintendo Switch is $400 right now, meaning you can get the new Switch 2 with Mario Kart for $50 more. The new console is also an upgrade in every way, according to Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt's Nintendo Switch 2 review. The ergonomics and design have improved, making it much better to hold and look at. The battery life has also improved, now with about 180 minutes of handheld playtime before the juice runs out.A big plus is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, meaning you can play your old Switch games on it. Some Switch games have the ability to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition by buying that game's upgrade pack. This is especially worth it for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which will look better on the Switch 2.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere aren't a lot of Switch 2 games out at the moment, but there are some classic Nintendo games to keep you busy until the library expands, like Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In macOS 26 Tahoe, Apple's shipped a bunch of ways to customize the look and feel of your Mac's desktop, app icons, and menu bar, among other things. And there's more to it than just tweaking how Liquid Glass looks. If you're the sort of person who enjoys theming and customization, try these tips.Tweak app icons in the Dock\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYour Mac's Dock probably has a bunch of colorful icons. I've always enjoyed those diverse colors, but others might want something more uniform. If you feel like going with a particular tint, or if you just want your app icons to use dark mode, it's just a quick tweak away. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and go to System Settings > Appearance > Icon & widget style. Here, you can change the app icons to Dark, Clear, or Tinted. The Tinted option lets you select a single tint for all your app icons, so choose the color you like the most.Customize the clock in your Mac's lock screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOnce you upgrade to macOS Tahoe, you'll probably notice the new clock on your lock screen. You can tweak this to your liking, too. Just go to System Settings > Wallpaper > Clock Appearance. You can choose one of six clock styles. Don't forget to adjust the slider below the Weight option, which lets you change the font to make the clock look sleeker or more prominent.\nCustomize the Control Center\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWith iOS 18's release in 2024, Apple started letting you customize your iPhone's Control Center. This year, that feature is finally on Mac, starting with macOS Tahoe. To use it, just click the Control Center button in the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen, and select Edit Controls. There are plenty of controls to choose from, so take your time and add what you need. You can drag-and-drop any of the controls to move them around, or you can click the - (minus) button next to any control to remove it from the Control Center. Alternatively, you can tweak your control center under System Settings > Menu Bar > Menu Bar Controls.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOne of the more controversial changes to macOS Tahoe is the swap to a transparent menu bar. The clear color sometimes makes it harder to read text, but if you don't like that, you can restore a background to your menu bar.

If you go to System Settings > Appearance > Theme and pick a color, you'll notice that this color also applies to the cursor in writing apps, and the color of selected items in menus, too. On the same menu page, you can also choose a different color for highlighted text, which is a nice additional level of customization. It ensures that if I pick a particularly bright color for my overall theme, I can still choose a milder color for text selection. That helps me stay focused while I'm working, which is something I value a lot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I know I have done a poor job of keeping track of media as I have upgraded computers and phones over the years, and I've lost my fair share of photos, videos, and documents along the way, whether on misplaced or damaged external drives or from simply forgetting to back up at all. Here's how to ensure your data is available for years to come. \nYou need multiple backups of your dataOne approach to backing up your data is the 3-2-1 strategy, which says you should keep three copies of your data across two different forms of storage, one of which should be offsite (in case a disaster strikes your home). A simple example: You have your photos and files on your computer, which is backed up regularly to both an external hard drive and a cloud service. That's three copies of your data on two storage types—an onsite physical device and remote cloud storage—the latter of which satisfies the \"offsite\" requirement because it is geographically separate from your other two copies. This approach protects against a single point of failure, such as a primary device dying, losing an external hard drive, or getting locked out of a cloud account. When it comes to backing up your data, redundancy matters. As Reddit users note, there are different interpretations of how to apply the 3-2-1 rule, such as whether your working copy on your primary device counts as one of three and whether the one offsite copy is included in the two forms of storage. And while a strict 3-2-1 strategy, or variations of it, may be more commonly employed at the enterprise level rather than by the average consumer, you could think about it as a general guideline for improving your backup system, especially if you don't have one at all. How to set up backupsYou never know when a device might fail, so it's a good idea to plan frequent backups, whether your data is syncing regularly to the cloud or you set reminders to manually push updates to your external hard drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany users sync their devices automatically to a service like iCloud or Google Drive, but relying on this as your sole backup doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to access all of your files in the future. As HowtoGeek points out, these backups are typically mirroring what's currently on your device rather than historical versions—so once you delete a photo, file, or folder from your computer or phone, it's also deleted from the cloud backup. This is useful for quick access as well as restoring to a new or factory-reset device, but it doesn't do much for the scores of media collected over the years that you don't use daily. You could use a dedicated cloud backup service like IDrive or Backblaze, which come with a lot of storage space for automatic, full device backups. This may be best for users who have large files or a lot of media that is essential to their jobs as well as those who prioritize data privacy. (However, Wirecutter notes that most online backup services leave a lot to be desired.) Others may be fine to manually move files and media to free or low-cost cloud storage, including iCloud, OneDrive, and Google. At a minimum, another backup should live on an external hard drive—and if you're not going to do cloud backups, consider two external drives stored in separate locations. Hardware can obviously be lost, stolen, damaged, or simply degraded over time, so again, you shouldn't rely on a single drive for all of your storage. Apple's Time Machine and Windows File History make it easy to save backups to an external drive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFinally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you tried to follow your feeds on X, or engage with ChatGPT, you were only met with error messages. Compare those error messages to one another, however, and you'd likely notice a similar name affixed to them all: Cloudflare. Cloudflare's massive Tuesday morning outage had sweeping implications for much of the web. While it's not clear what caused the outage at this time, we do know whether the outage was responsible for a website's downtime. (When an error page says \"Cloudflare: Error,\" it's not difficult to track down the source of the problem.) As Cloudflare offers web infrastructure services to a huge number of sites, the true list of affected sites is likely massive. As an example, I wanted to convert the timezone Cloudflare uses in its status reports, UTC, to ET, and the first website I clicked on in my Google search returned an error. While there's no central repository listing each and every affected website, we can look at the sites with the largest number of user reports indicating issues this morning through Downdetector. (Disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Lifehacker.) Ironically, Downdetector itself was down this morning—it too uses Cloudflare.\nDowndetector is not a service that investigates and reports websites that are down. Instead, users can self-report issues with sites on Downdetector. As such, it can be illuminating to see which sites visitors were having issues with during the period of time Cloudflare was down. At this time, that includes the following:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nXCloudflareOpenAIChatGPTGrindrArchive of Our OwnAWSSpotifyLeague of LegendseClinicalWorksQuizletUberCharacter.aiCanvaClaudeVaroIndeedProcoreTruth SocialFanFictionArloDoorDashValorantRunescapeDayforceNJTransitSniffiesSquareGoogleZoomRoverCollegeBoardLetterboxd  Bet365MoneyLionDayZBetMGMYouTubeMicrosoftIKEASunoMicrosoft 365Canvas by InstructureMicrosoft TeamsAmazonGrokInstagramGeminiAgain, this list is not definitive, nor is it official.

The app picks up on your interests quickly, and before you know it, you're falling down an hours-deep rabbit hole every time you launch it. But the algorithm doesn't always get it right: Sometimes, you end up seeing too much of one type of content, no matter how many times you hit \"Not Interested.\" With the rise of AI-generated content, this problem only gets more frustrating. AI video generators like Sora are empowering people to produce more hyperrealistic AI slop than ever, which means you've likely encountered it on your feeds—whether you know it or not. I've certainly laughed at some AI clips here and there, but for the most part, I can't stand coming across them in the wild. And they aren't just a nuisance, they can be legitimately dangerous—some have even tricked users into installing malware on their smartphones. As this content become more normalized, I worry for our collective ability to spot misinformation across our social media platforms, so whenever you can take a step to reducing or removing this content from your feeds, I encourage you to do so.  \nAnd as it happens, TikTok is now experimenting with a tool to help you control the AI slop on your For You Page. Per a Wednesday press release, the company says it will roll out the new option in the existing \"Manage topics\" menu of the app's settings page. Manage topics already lets you finely tune parts of your individual TikTok algorithm to show you more of one subject or less of another—you can manage things like creative arts, current affairs, dance, fashion and beauty, food and drinks, health and fitness, humor, lifestyle, nature, pets, sports, travel. Soon, the section will add a slider for AI-generated content as well, if the option isn't live for you already. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to limit AI slop in TikTokTikTok says this new option is rolling out \"in the coming weeks,\" which is unfortunately vague. I don't have the option, even after installing the latest version of TikTok. However, that also means it could hit your app at any time. When it does, here's how to use it:Open TikTok, then tap \"Profile\" in the bottom right.Tap the hamburger menu icon in the top right, then choose \"Settings and privacy.\" Under \"Content & Display,\" choose \"Content preferences,\" then choose \"Manage topics.\"When the option is available on your app, adjust the \"AI-generated content\" slider. Move it left to see less AI-generated content, or move it right to see more of this content. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to completely remove AI content from your TikTok feed. Hopefully with this slider in place, however, you'll greatly reduce the amount of AI content you see, to the point where it's effectively gone entirely. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Opening your statement to see expensive charges you didn't make is stressful, and canceling your card—and dealing with all of your attached subscriptions—is a nightmare. So if you get a call about an unauthorized charge for a brand new iPhone, you're probably going to want to get to the bottom of it. Here's the thing: It's likely a scam. I speak from experience: My wife keeps getting calls from unknown numbers, all of which leave voicemails about charges for iPhones. The voicemail starts off with what sounds like standard holding music. Suddenly, a voice pops in, saying something to the affect of: \"This is Amazon. This call is to authorize the payment of $999 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 16 Pro on your account. If you do not authorize this payment, please press \"one\" to speak to our customer support representative.\" Your call may also be about, \"the payment of $1,099 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 17 Pro on your account.\" We are inundated with the calls, and besides the payment amount and the specific iPhone model, the rest of the message is identical. As you might expect, no such charges are actually present on either our Amazon account or in our credit card history. That's because no one bought an iPhone in our name, or by using our financial information: This was simply a scam.\nHad we answered the phone and pressed \"one\" to speak with a \"customer support representative,\" or called the number back after listening to the voicemail, this is what would have likely happened: The \"representative\" would have assured us that they would be able to dispute the charge, but of course they'd need some information from us first. Perhaps they would have needed us to confirm the credit card information, and would ask us to read our digits out loud. Maybe they'd need to make sure we actually owned the Amazon account in question, and would ask for our two-factor authentication code to \"confirm our identity.\" No matter what the case, the scammers would have been praying on our concern about the charge to extract some type of sensitive information from us, all for their own financial gain. Had we called back and complied, we would have almost assuredly handed the scammers the money we thought they were helping us get back.  What to do if you get this voicemailIf you get a voicemail like this, don't call them back. If you pick up the phone, and you get this message, don't press \"one;\" just hang up. You are definitely being scammed, and there's no risk in simply ignoring the caller completely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you'd like to verify their claims, don't involve the caller at all. Instead, head to your Amazon account, and check your order history. You'll be able to see if any such iPhones were ordered under your account—and, if they were, you can cancel the order here. Similarly, check your credit card history: If you don't see a charge for an iPhone, there wasn't one. If you do see one, reach out to the credit card company directly through their official contact information.  Scammers rely on pressure tactics that stress you out, and make you feel like time is of the essence. It rarely ever is. While it might seem common practice for companies like Amazon to call customers about large charges, it really isn't. If you ever receive unsolicited communications from someone claiming to represent a company you belong to, you can always end the conversation, and reach out directly yourself. If you contact Amazon's official customer support, or the company that issues your credit card, they'll be able to confirm or deny the claim for you.  While you can block the number, it might not do much good. Each time we've received a call, it's been from a different number, so my guess is they're not reusing numbers when calling you back. Instead, you should strongly consider using one of Apple's built-in anti-spam tools. If you're running iOS 26, you can choose to have your iPhone screen calls from unknown numbers, and ask for information before sending the call your way. No matter which version of iOS you have, you can also choose to silence unknown callers en masse, so you're never interrupted by any caller that isn't in your contacts. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

And I’ve always struggled with caulking. It's difficult to get smooth, equal caulk lines, and when caulking large areas my arm gets pretty tired, especially if I’m pushing some thick and heavy material out of that tube. Plus, I always ended up wiping away accidents with my hands, leaving me smeared with caulk.After years of constant frustration, it finally occurred to me that the culprit might be the old-school manual caulk gun I’d been using for decades. It’s bent, rusted, and covered in a crust of old caulk, cement, and dirt; I couldn’t think of a single reason why I hadn’t upgraded it. When I did, I decided to try out a power caulking gun, so I picked up this cordless one by DeWalt. It's not the cheapest option, but I love this thing.\nWhat is a power caulking gun?A power caulking gun is similar to the standard manual tool you’re used to. It’s a bit bulkier and heavier, of course, but it operates in much the same way: You pop in a cartridge (or a sausage tube if your gun can switch between them), you cut the tip, and the rod pushes the caulk or adhesive out. The main difference is that the rod advances automatically when you press the trigger—you don’t have to keep exerting force with your hand, and caulk is dispensed continuously instead of in the chaotic waves I always managed manually.\nWhy you need a power caulking gunWhat’s fantastic about this power caulk gun is the level of control. You can set the maximum and minimum speed of the tool precisely, so you get exactly the flow rate you need for your job, and you can change speed within that range easily with the trigger. It comes with different canister trays to accommodate different tubes, and it has a nifty little light that allows you to actually see what you’re doing—something I didn’t realize I needed until I experienced it. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOne thing I love is that the rod retracts when you release the trigger, preventing caulk or adhesive from oozing out of the tube. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve set the caulking gun down to do something and discovered a nice pile of caulk on my floor. That’s not an issue any more.There’s a bit of a learning curve with this—it’ll take a moment to get a feel for the flow and to mentally calibrate what speed setting is right for what job. Once you get the hang of it, though, being able to caulk an entire run of tile or countertop without pausing feels like a superpower. And not getting covered in caulk is priceless.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

I'm talking about Preview, an app whose name hides its versatility. It can do a lot more than just opening different types of files. For PDFs, it's as good as most free PDF editors.

In macOS 26 Tahoe, Preview now allows you to enable dark mode for any PDF file, which means that I no longer need to deal with bright white backgrounds when I have to go through any PDF document. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview on your Mac. Now click the View button in the menu bar up top, and select Use Dark Appearance for PDF.\nInsert pages in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview lets you easily add pages to a PDF file. You can either add a blank page or insert a page from a different file. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview, and go to Edit > Insert. You can either choose Blank Page or Page from File….The option to insert a blank page in the PDF is self-explanatory. If you want to insert a page from a different file, there are different ways to do so. The option in the Edit menu will directly insert the whole PDF or image file you select into your PDF. This is fine when you're selecting a single-page PDF that needs to go into a bigger file, but it's not ideal if you want to add just one page from a 50-page document. If you're trying to do this, add pages by opening two PDF files side-by-side in Preview, and dragging pages from the first to the second PDF file. If the sidebar is hidden in Preview, go to View > Thumbnails. You can now drag the thumbnail from one sidebar to another with ease.Reorder pages in a PDF \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you want to change the order of pages in a PDF file in Preview, just drag and rearrange the thumbnails in the sidebar.

Once again, just open a PDF file in Preview, select any page in the sidebar, and press the Delete button to remove the page from your PDF document.

These tools, along with the options to annotate and sign PDFs, are all available under the Markup Toolbar in Preview for Mac. To access these tools, open any PDF in Preview, and click the pencil icon in the toolbar. Alternatively, you can go to View > Show Markup Toolbar. These tools are more than sufficient for quick edits to PDF documents.Add a PDF password\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use Preview to add a password to a PDF file, or to remove passwords from a file. To add a password to the PDF file you're viewing in Preview, go to File > Edit Permissions, and check the box labelled Require Password to Open Document. Once you've added and confirmed the password, you'll also have to add an owner password to the document. The owner password lets you restrict others from making changes to the PDF file, printing it, etc. Ideally, it should be different from the password used to open the PDF file. With both passwords added, click Apply to confirm the changes.Rotate pages in a PDF\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, PDF files arrive with an unusable orientation—e.g., portrait pages scanned in landscape mode. In such cases, you can use Preview to rotate the pages of a PDF. Just go to the page you want to rotate and press Command-L to rotate it left or Command-R to rotate right. Fun fact: You can also do the same thing using your trackpad. Use two fingers to mimic a rotating motion and you'll see that the page of the PDF file rotates to the left or the right.These options are also available under the Tools menu. Over there, you'll also find options to flip a page horizontally or vertically, as well as a feature that removes the background from a PDF page.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That means scammers are also busy contacting people, impersonating insurance providers in an effort to collect personal, financial, and medical information.Fraudsters especially love to impersonate representatives from Medicare, targeting older adults and others who qualify for the federal program with unexpected calls. As the Federal Trade Commission warns, scammers may have some of your personal information already and will ask you to confirm your Medicare, bank account, and/or credit card number under the guise of sending you a new Medicare card. In reality, Medicare cards are free and sent automatically, so you should never need to provide payment. Scammers may also target consumers on Marketplace, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans with a similar tactic, claiming that you may lose or be disqualified from health coverage unless you make a payment. \nIn addition to impersonating government officials, bad actors will pretend to represent a legitimate insurer, promising discounted plans (that are available only for a limited time) or enrollment assistance (for a fee). Plans that seem too good to be true probably aren't health insurance at all and may not provide the coverage promised. And you shouldn't have to pay anyone to sign up for a plan.  Note that while scammers may ramp up efforts during open enrollment, health insurance scams can happen year-round. A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) advisory warns consumers about common tactics like calls and texts in which scammers—impersonating government agencies or insurance companies—offer health screening, free gifts, or other promotional benefits in exchange for your personal information. Bad actors can pretty easily spoof phone numbers (so it looks like you're getting a call from a reputable insurance provider like Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield) as well as set up phishing websites designed to steal your credentials and financial information. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInsurance scam red flagsAs always, unsolicited communication that pressures you to take action is almost always a scam. Medicare representatives will never call, email, or text you to verify information or demand payment, nor will legitimate government officials try to sell you anything or threaten you unless you pay up. If someone claims they represent an insurer and asks for money or sensitive personal information, or if they threaten you with legal action, hang up. Don't share any data, including your social security number, bank account number, or medical history with anyone—that is, unless you have contacted the Medicare office or other legitimate agency directly and first and need to verify your identity. (The number for Medicare is 1-800-MEDICARE, and you can reach a Marketplace representative through HealthCare.gov). Always verify a representative's identity using official contact information found on a .gov website, legitimate company page, or an account statement, and never send money via gift card, prepaid debit, or crytocurrency in exchange for anything. You should also ensure your credentials for your insurance accounts (like HealthCare.gov and Medicare.gov) are strong and secure, and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I noticed a few days ago that it has a new feature: A research function divided into \"fast research\" and \"deep research.\" After playing around with it a little, these new features seem to completely defeat the purpose of why I started using NotebookLM in the first place—with one big exception. What the new \"fast research\" and \"deep research\" options in NotebookLM doIn short, \"fast research\" and \"deep research\" make NotebookLM work a lot like other AI tools—they pull information in from the web on your behalf—and that's the primary reason I don't see myself using them.\nWhen you use the deep research tool, you enter in what you want to research as a topic in the left panel, where you also typically store all the PDFs, links, and other materials you manually inputted as the sources for NotebookLM to pull from. This is where it differs from the premise NotebookLM has basically been built on since it was launched: The software searches the internet for sources, broadening the selection of materials the generated quizzes, podcasts, summaries, and flashcards will pull from. Before this update, it was entirely on you to find and input your own sources. The fast research tool is similar. Instead of finding the sources and generating a long report, it just suggests a handful of new sources for you to consider. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhether using deep or fast research mode, you have the option to deselect sources if you don't like them, but it's tricky to review them. I tried it on a Notebook I have set up to study for my upcoming personal training certification exam. It spit out a selection of titles like \"Free NASM Practice Test,\" shown above on the left. I had to click the \"7 more links\" link to expand the panel, which then revealed where the sources were from and gave me the chance to open them in a new tab to review them before agreeing to import them (shown on the right). Finding and assessing sources on my own is a crucial first step in my learning and brainstorming process, so I don't see myself ever using this. The reason I love using NotebookLM is that it doesn't do the work for me. It's still my responsibility to go out and find all the sources I need, then input them so it can help me synthesize the contents. I use it for studying, for work, and to organize my personal projects. None of those things benefit much from random outside sourcing. And, as is a risk with all AI tools, there's no guarantee it will find sources that are credible (again, it found me a Reddit thread I could have easily found for myself). The one useful new feature in the NotebookLM updateWhen you're inputting the topic you want NotebookLM to research, you'll notice a dropdown menu. It's automatically set to \"Web,\" meaning it will pull sources from the internet, but you can also set it to go through your Google Drive instead. That is helpful. I keep everything related to all my projects in distinct Drive folders already. Using this feature can help me input all the relevant materials when I need them instead of having to add them in manually, one by one. That's the sort of utility I have been enjoying NotebookLM for over the past few months.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In its November fraud and scam advisory, Google is warning users about VPN apps and extensions that appear legitimate but are actually vectors for malware.VPNs may actually be spyware A VPN, or virtual private network, makes your internet activity much more difficult to track by routing your traffic through a different connection rather than your regular internet service provider (ISP). This allows you to hide your IP address and location, obscure your browsing data, and protect your information and devices from bad actors. According to Google, malicious VPNs (posing as real ones) are delivering infostealers, remote access trojans, and banking trojans to user devices once installed, allowing hackers to access sensitive personal data like browsing history, financial credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet information. This means that an app you rely on to keep your information private could be doing the exact opposite. Cybercriminals are capitalizing on user trust in these services, creating apps that look and feel like legitimate VPNs but are actually dangerous spyware. \nHow to ensure your VPN app is safeAs with any app or extension, only download or install a VPN from an official source like the Google Play store. While malicious programs do sometimes sneak through, it's typically safer and more reliable than sideloading through a messaging app or other unvetted site. In January 2025, Google launched a VPN verification process to help users identify trustworthy VPN apps in the Google Play store. To earn a \"verified\" badge, VPN apps have to undergo a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation and opt into independent security reviews. Badges are awarded only to VPNs that have been published for at least 90 days and reach 10,000 installs and 250 user reviews. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, this system isn't perfect either: As TechRadar reported earlier this year, a popular (free) Chrome VPN extension earned a badge and was later discovered to be spying on users. That's why you should rely on a reputable VPN service—which means you'll likely have to pay for it. Free VPNs are far more likely to a privacy nightmare, and any app that sounds too good to be true probably is. You aren't going to get unlimited traffic at no cost without sacrificing something. Finally, review VPN permissions carefully, and allow the minimum access possible for the app or extension to function. (You should do this with any app you download, and you should audit apps regularly to remove unnecessary permissions.) You can check your VPN service's support pages to find out which permissions are essential—this should not include access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or photos, for example. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Websites from X to ChatGPT went offline as Cloudflare, the company they rely on for web infrastructure services, experienced a massive outage. A huge number of sites and services across the world contract Cloudflare for cybersecurity protections, as well as to route traffic through servers local to each user, all in the name of performance and reliability. Ironic, of course, given today's events.When the public experiences such a massive internet outage, speculation runs awry. What caused this? Was it a simple bug on Cloudflare's part, or something malicious? Are bad actors attacking Cloudflare, and the sites that rely on it? But, as it turns out, the reason appears to be closer to the former than the latter.Cloudflare's outage was a glitchIn a statement to Mashable, Cloudflare confirmed that the company had identified the cause of the issue, and had rolled out a fix to patch it. In addition, Cloudflare is adamant there is no reason to believe a cyberattack caused this outage. This is the full statement: \n\"Many of Cloudflare's services experienced a significant outage today beginning around 11:20 UTC. It was fully resolved at 14:30 UTC. The root cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic. The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity. We expect that some Cloudflare services will be briefly degraded as traffic naturally spikes post incident but we expect all services to return to normal in the next few hours. A detailed explanation will be posted soon on blog.cloudflare.com. Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable. We apologize to our customers and the Internet in general for letting you down today. We will learn from today's incident and improve.\" It seems the reason for the outage was a preventative measure meant to block a potential cyberattack. While that goal is obviously important, it shows how complex these systems really are: One glitch with one cybersecurity protocol spun out of control, and took down the network en masse.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's the end of an era: TiVo no longer manufactures or sells the DVRs that made the company a household name. If you still have one, the company will continue to support it, but don't go looking for one: TiVo as we know it is effectively over.TiVo didn't make a big deal about this discontinuation, however. As it happens, Luke Bouma of Cord Cutter News was the first to spot the development. Earlier this month, Bouma reported that TiVo Corporation had silently ended its DVR line, removing all references to the devices on its website. Following Bouma's reporting, TiVo's parent company, Xperi, confirmed the news.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn a statement to PCMag, an Xperi spokesperson said: \"I can confirmed that as of [Oct.] 1, 2025, TiVo stopped selling physical DVR products, including hardware and accessories, both online and through agents...TiVo no longer manufacturers hardware, and our remaining inventory is now depleted, though we will continue to offer support for the products going forward.\" TiVo isn't gone entirely. The brand now develops both TiVo OS, a smart TV operating system similar to Roku OS or Fire OS, as well as DTS AutoStage Video Service, an entertainment service developed for cars. But it is no longer a DVR manufacturer or seller, which might shock a time traveler from the early 2000s.The TiVo effectTech comes and goes, but if you weren't watching TV in the late '90s and early 2000s, you might not know how monumental TiVo really was. The company launched its first DVRs in 1999 and introduced the market to features like one-touch simple recording, a hard drive to save multiple recordings at once, and, perhaps most notably, the ability to \"pause\" live TV and fast forward through commercials. The DVR offered viewers so much more than a simple VCR could, which only allowed for linear recording to single cassettes. TiVo could record live video from any input, including analog, cable, or satellite, which offered users flexibility in the content they recorded.Before TiVo, if you missed the start of a show, you simply had to deal with it and try to jump in as best as you could—assuming you didn't set a VCR to record it, of course. If you had a TiVo, however, you could simply rewind to the start of the program, and, when you reached a commercial break, skip ahead back to the show—until you caught up with the live broadcast. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTiVo disrupted the way consumers watched TV, and we're likely seeing the ramifications of that today. The market adapted, and cable companies started offering their own DVRs with cloud-based recording as opposed to hard drive recording. Streaming services built on that momentum: Viewers were already getting used to watching shows whenever it suited them, so why not get ahead of the game, and offer all shows on-demand at any time? There's no need to choose which programs to record: Everything is available at any time. Like other early technology pioneers that fell behind with time, TiVo struggled through the streaming age it arguably helped create. The company hasn't released a DVR since 2019, when it launched the TiVo Edge. That DVR had support for modern features, like 4K Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos sound, and access to major streaming apps, in addition to recording live TV. It then tried to break into the streaming device market with the TiVo Stream 4K, but the competition was too fierce to make an impact. In a twist of irony, as TiVo discontinues its DVRs, streaming services are turning to ad-supported plans with increasing frequency. TiVo changed the game by letting us skip ads, and streaming originally omitted the ads entirely. But more and more customers are comfortable paying less to deal with commercials. We've come full circle in a way. TiVo's time might be at an end, but its impact lives on. What Skype did for video calls, TiVo did for TV. I'll be thinking about that the next time I boot up something to watch on Netflix or Hulu.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Drugs, death, and depravity are probably what come to mind whenever you hear about the dark web. Or, is it the deep web? Is it both? You might find yourself conflating the two terms, with the assumption that both the dark web and the deep web are the same place—a spot people flock to for reasons that include illegal and/or generally shady activities. But while the dark web is a part of the deep web, the deep web isn’t really the dark web. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe \"regular internet\" is the surface webI need to start this explanation with a different term altogether: The internet as most of us know it is called the “surface web.” (Perhaps you've also heard it called the open web or visible web.) Essentially, it’s a collection of sites that are indexed by search engines. If it pops up in a Google search, it’s a part of the surface web. This article, for example, is a part of the surface web; CNET's homepage is a part of the surface web; the Facebook login screen is a part of the surface web. Most of the internet you're familiar with is likely covered under this definition. That’s not the case with the deep web or the dark web. You can’t open Chrome and expect to find any dark web pages via a Google search. For the deep web, you'll need to visit each website individually, and, in the case of the dark web, while using a special browser altogether. What exactly is the deep web?Also known as the “hidden” web, the deep web is the collection of sites that aren’t indexed by search engines. Most of these sites are obscured behind login pages, and can range from banking and email pages, to paywalled content like streaming sites. Sure, you’ll find Netflix via a Google search, but you won’t find the player for Love Is Blind, Season 9, Episode 1 unless you log into the site first. The deep web also consists of protocol pages, responsible for identifying user accounts when you log in to a site, running payments when you make a purchase, and other processes you never need to see. In short, it’s both the backbone of the internet, as well as a part of the internet you regularly interact with yourself. And it's actually what makes up most of the internet: According to CrowdStrike, the deep web accounts for over 90% of all content online. Deep web pages aren’t indexed, but they often have URLs that can be linked to directly, and are accessible from traditional web browsers like Chrome or Firefox. In your daily life online, you frequently jump between the surface web and the deep web, likely without realizing it. When you open your bank's website, that's the surface web. When you log into your account, your balance and investments are hosted on the deep web. When you open a YouTube video, that's the surface web. If you access your YouTube account's settings page, that's the deep web. You jump through these hoops all the time, but fear not: Your frequent deep web activity never puts you in danger of accessing the dark web. What exactly is the dark web?The dark web is a subsection (a small one, at that) of the deep web. But unlike the latter, the dark web is not accessible via a typical web browser like Chrome or Firefox. That's because it's not just hidden by login pages or hidden URLs; the dark web uses both encryption and routing to mask its websites, as well as proxy servers to host requests and traffic without any centralized regulation. This is still the deep web, it's just not a part of it you'd ever stumble upon by accident.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to access the dark webIf you want to access the dark web, you need special tools to do so. A specific browser, such as Tor, for example, is required to get started. Just as you use Chrome to access public internet sites like Facebook or Lifehacker, you use a dark web browser to access dark web pages. It's also common to know the specific dark web site you want to visit ahead of time; these often end in .onion instead of .com. While the dark web does have its own search engines, like Ahmia, Torch, and even a special version of DuckDuckGo, they are not as robust as the search engines you're used to.   Since you need special protocols to access these sites, that traffic is often private and anonymous. That’s what makes the dark web an attractive option for illegal activities—the site activity isn’t as easily traced back to individual user accounts. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the common tender on the dark web, since it also protects your privacy during transactions. The dark web isn't just illegal stuffWhen you think of the “dark web,” you probably imagine an underground, secretive network of sites, where illegal activities are aplenty, passing drugs, contraband, and illicit media with reckless abandon. You might also hear about data leaks ending up on the dark web, with bad actors paying for your passwords, hacked accounts, and credit card info. Those sites surely exist, but they’re only one part of what’s known as the dark web, which isn't only a playground for the perverse and malicious. While many common use-cases for the dark web might be against the law, anyone with a reason to be anonymous online can utilize the networks. Common examples of “good” on the dark web are whistleblowers who need a place to leak their information without having the governments and organizations responsible for that data knowing who they are, as well as legitimate news and information sites for citizens of countries with strict censorship laws. One study from 2020 estimates that 57% of the dark web contains illegal content. If true, that's a lot, but it also means the other 43% isn't breaking the law.  In short, the deep web is not a scary place. The dark web can be, but not always.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

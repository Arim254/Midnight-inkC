Researchers at security firm LayerX have analyzed multiple campaigns in recent months involving malicious browser extensions, including the widespread GhostPoster scheme targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs. Fake Chrome extensions look like popular AI assistantsThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior. Though the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update. \nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Samsung’s brightest OLED TV thus far, released in 2025, is the S95F, praised for its picture quality and surprisingly impressive sound. Right now, a 65-inch refurbished Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV is just $1,899, which is over $1,000 off its list price.\nThis TV's deep blacks, dramatic contrast, and “very bright OLED panel”, as PCMag describes it, are the standout features on this large-screen 4K TV. Beyond improved brightness that maxes out at a striking 2,386 nits, it also features fantastic color performance and a powerful, advanced 4.2.2-channel speaker system that reduces the need for an external speaker or soundbar. The TV has a nearly bezel-less design and a One Connect box to minimize cable clutter.The S95F also has some of the best anti-glare tech, which is rare for an OLED. While the LG G5 is technically brighter, its anti-glare system doesn’t perform as well. The S95F’s matte anti-reflection coating drastically reduces glare and is designed specifically to perform well in bright rooms, which is a major perk if the room your TV is in gets a lot of daylight. It supports HDR10 and HDR10+ content at 120Hz, with up to 165Hz variable refresh rate  and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.  Like other Samsung TVs, this one doesn’t support Dolby Vision.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe TV is covered by Woot’s 90-day limited warranty, and ships free for Amazon Prime users (otherwise, shipping is $6). Since it’s refurbished, it may have minimal signs of wear, but that won’t affect performance.\n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.WhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.Speaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: WhatsApp\n                    \n    \nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.Still, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.WhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Maybe you just have the misfortune to be busy at your computer when a power outage happens—taking your desktop, Microsoft Word, and your unsaved work along with it.However, before you begin all over again, there are some tricks you can try to bring your work back. \nUse Undo (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z)\n    \n            \n            Word keeps an undo history.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSometimes, all you need is the undo command—hit Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (macOS) to undo your last action in Word. It might be enough to restore that table you accidentally deleted, or bring back that huge block of text you moved to the clipboard and have since lost track of.This won't save you from a power outage, and it doesn't include all actions (it won't bring back a file you've closed, for example). However, it'll work a lot of the time when you've made a mistake, and Word always keeps a record of your last 100 actions in the app, so you can go back a fair way.There's also an undo button up in the top left corner of the Word interface: Click on this to undo the last action, or click the arrow next to it to see a list of previous actions and choose where you want to go back to. To the right of the undo button is the redo button, which works the same way but in the opposite direction.Open previous file versions\n    \n            \n            Accessing previous versions in Word.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWord also has a file version history feature you can utilize to bring back lost work: It essentially saves past versions of your document at regular intervals, so you can go back in time, and even all the way back to the file's creation. It's like a super undo, which works between app restarts as well.In Word for Windows, you can find these older incarnations of your document by heading to File > Info > Version History. If you're using Word on macOS, it's File > Browse Version History. A new sidebar opens on the right, showing all the available previous versions, and the date and time they were saved.There is a caveat to this, though, which is you have to have your document saved in the cloud (in OneDrive) for this to work. If you're working with a local file that's only saved on your computer and you try and access version history, you'll be prompted to save it to OneDrive instead (which will turn on version history).Find unsaved documents on your system\n    \n            \n            Unsaved documents are sometimes still available.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWord actually saves files temporarily to your computer every so often, so if the program crashes without warning, you should see an autorecovery dialog pop up the next time you load Word, asking if you want to recover the old file. If not, you can see partially saved files by clicking Click File > Info > Manage Document > Recover Unsaved Documents.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's only for Windows, however—if you're on macOS, you're relying on the auto-recovery process. Word for both Windows and macOS lets you set how often auto-recovery files are saved: Head to File > Options > Save (Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save (macOS). The default is every 10 minutes, but you can adjust this if needed.If you're still not seeing your file, you can try checking the temporary cache folder manually. On Windows, check \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\" or \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles.\" On macOS try \"/Users//Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\"—adding in your own username where relevant.Save your work to the cloud\n    \n            \n            OneDrive gives you various extra options—including AutoSave.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThese days, Microsoft Word will tend to push you to save your work in OneDrive in the cloud. There are multiple benefits for this, including the version history feature mentioned above, and the option to collaborate on documents with other people. It also enables another handy feature: AutoSave.This is exactly what it sounds like, and means that every time something is changed in your document, it quickly syncs to the cloud. You'll see the AutoSave button in the top left hand corner enabled when it's active, and the document name at the top of the app window will indicate when saves are in progress.Should Word or your PC crash, your work should be safe. AutoSave is enabled by default for files saved to OneDrive, but you can customize this behavior by heading to File > Options > Save on Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save on macOS.\n            ",

With its latest update, Google Chrome for desktop now has three new productivity features: Split View, PDF annotations, and the ability to save downloads directly to Google Drive. These features are targeted at both regular and enterprise users, the company says, so you don't need to worry about Workspace exclusivity. Let's take a look at each new feature and how you can best use it.Split View lets you boost your productivity\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nOver the years, the internet browser has become a super app of sorts, since it has access to so many useful sites and web apps. In Chrome, I often find myself taking notes while attending meetings online, or keeping a second tab open for research while I write articles. For many people, a single Chrome tab or window is no longer enough, and with that in mind, Google's added Split View to the desktop version of its browser.Split View merges two tabs and displays them in the same window. You can think of it like the split-screen view in old school video games. You can use Split View by right-clicking any tab and selecting Add Tab to New Split View. For now, Chrome allows you to have a maximum of two tabs side by side in Split View, although I hope you'll eventually be able to add more in the future. In its current form, the feature is great for using Google Docs while watching an educational video, or similar two-tab use cases. Finally, no more opening single tabs in separate windows and then resizing them into your own, makeshift split view.\nYou can easily drag the slider in between the two tabs to give one tab more screen space than the other. Or for more control, you can click the Split View button to the left of the address bar and select the Arrange Split View menu (this is also available if you right click the merged tabs in your tab bar). This is an easy way to quickly reverse the order of the two tabs, separate them, or close just one of the tabs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate PDFs in Chrome\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLet's be honest: Chrome is probably the PDF viewer that most people use. No matter how many fancy PDF editing apps I or my colleagues recommend, for the most part, you're going to search for and open PDFs in your browser. Luckily, now you no longer have to use a different app for basic annotations. Chrome's desktop PDF Viewer now has tools for highlighting text, adding notes, and even making digital signatures. You're still going to need a different app for advanced PDF edits, but Chrome is now capable enough to handle the basics.Save PDF files directly to Google Drive\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWhenever you download a PDF file using Google Chrome, it defaults to saving them to the Downloads folder on your computer, or to another location on your hard drive. On desktop, Google now lets you save these files directly to your Google Drive account. This can be very useful if you want to keep your local storage clear. When you open a PDF file in Chrome, you'll see a Google Drive icon in the toolbar, next to the download button. Clicking the Google Drive icon will automatically save it to the cloud storage service, in a new folder called \"Saved from Chrome.\"\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes. Thankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

While the root causes of these problems tend to vary, there are some broad fixes you can try that should go some way to giving you an iPhone keyboard experience you can rely on—besides waiting for the next bug-squashing iOS update from Apple.Reset the keyboard dictionary on your iPhone\n    \n            \n            Resetting the keyboard on iOS.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOver time, the iOS keyboard tries to build up smarter autocorrect suggestions for you, but these aren't always helpful: The further away these suggestions get from the defaults, the worse they can get, which risks turning your sentences into gibberish. To clean the slate and go back to the beginning, open up Settings, then tap General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary. Type in your handset's unlock code, then choose Reset Dictionary.Add custom words and shortcuts to your iPhone's dictionaryThis may seem to contradict the previous tip, but by explicitly teaching your iPhone the words it often gets wrong, you can reduce the likelihood of those frustrating moments where iOS suddenly replaces the word you were typing with something else (e.g. \"he'll yeah\" or \"what the duck\"). From Settings, tap General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. Tap on the + (plus) button in the top right corner, then enter your word or phrase—you can add a shortcut for it too to help you type it more quickly, but it's optional. Tap Save to confirm.\nAdjust other iPhone keyboard settings\n    \n            \n            If a keyboard setting isn't helping, turn it off.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are more keyboard settings that are worth taking a look at under General > Keyboard in iOS Settings. You can turn Auto-Correction off completely, for example, and disable Slide to Type if your fingers have a tendency to slip across the keyboard. There are additional tweaks you can make through the Accessibility menu in Settings: Under Touch > Touch Accommodations, you can change the sensitivity of double-taps and press-and-holds, among other settings, which may help improve typing accuracy.Change your iPhone's keyboard layoutThere's not a lot you can do with the iPhone keyboard layout to improve your typing experience and eliminate bugs, but there is a one-handed mode you can try in order to minimize glitches and ensure your keypresses match up with what's on screen. To switch to the one-handed layout, tap and hold on the globe icon in the lower left corner of the keyboard, then tap one of the icons at the bottom of the pop-up menu: You can move the keyboard to the left, or the right, or put it back to normal.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSwitch to a different keyboard on the iPhone\n    \n            \n            You've got several options for iOS keyboards.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you're still struggling with the vagaries of the keyboard on iOS, you can always opt to install a third-party alternative: We've covered a bunch here, including Gboard and SwiftKey, and they typically offer more customization options than the Apple default. Once you've installed an alternative keyboard or two, you can manage them from iOS Settings by choosing General > Keyboard > Keyboards. To actually switch between keyboards when typing, press and hold on the globe icon (lower left).Or avoid a keyboard altogetherThere are also some more extreme measures you can take that maybe haven't crossed your mind. The first is to use a Bluetooth keyboard (via Bluetooth in Settings), which will give you a more convenient (if less portable) way of typing text into your iPhone. The second is to ensure dictation is enabled in General > Keyboard in Settings, then tap the mic icon in the lower right corner of the keyboard, and speak out your text. You can handle emojis, line breaks, text editing, and more, using your voice.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.As part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears. While I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.    \nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther new features in this Release Preview Channel updateThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.  You can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.   \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.AI assistants are coming to CarPlay in iOS 26.4As spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.According to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant. \nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstall the iOS 26.4 at your own riskThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.   When and what time is Google I/O 2026?Google tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions. But if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years. \nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel. What will be announced at Google I/O 2026?The short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O. Like the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about. I/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware.

It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited. As reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.If you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jake Peterson\n                    \n    \nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

According to a report from The Information, Meta's watch, codenamed Malibu 2, could feature fitness tracking features and AI, but its real purpose is to replace the Display's neural band and act as controller for the smart glasses. If the reports are accurate, Meta Display smart glasses with a smart watch could be available in 2026.There aren't any other details on the smart watch, so we don't know the price or what features it may have—but I'd be surprised if this rumor doesn't pan out eventually. Meta has discussed the idea of a smart watch before, and it makes sense: If you're going to have a wrist-controller for your glasses, why not give it smart watch features as well? Especially if a glasses-and-watch combo potentially gives users a reason to switch away from their Apple Watches. Apple is reportedly working on AI wearables tooSpeaking of Apple, if the rumors about the company are true, Apple is pushing to release its own suite of AI-powered wearable devices. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple could roll out smart glasses in early 2027. The company is also reportedly developing an AI-powered pendant that can \"be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace,\" as well as AirPods with expanded AI capabilities. The AirPods and pendant will be equipped with cameras designed to \"help the AI work\" as opposed to taking photos. Apple's smart glasses will reportedly not feature a display, but will feature a higher end camera and superior build quality to Meta's smart glasses. All of Apple's devices are reportedly designed to work with iPhones.\nIs the wearable war heating up?None of this is confirmed, of course. The closest Apple has come to announcing these plans is CEO Tim Cook mentioning “categories of products” enabled by artificial intelligence at an all-hands meeting. However, everything points to Meta and Apple betting that consumers want a collection of connected AI-wearables. Each company is taking a different approach to hooking users into their ecosystem. Apple seems to be betting on devices integrated with iPhones and controlled with the kind of camera-based tech that powers the Apple Vision Pro headset. Meta seems to be aiming at replacing phones with an in-glasses display, and a biometric control scheme that works with muscle movements, like the existing neural band. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBoth Meta and Apple seem to be competing to go beyond a screen or smart glasses to become the next interface for your life—but do people want that? Are consumers excited enough by the prospect of always-available AI and tied-together devices to buy them? That's the big question, and the answer is anything but certain. Both Apple and Meta have made big bets on virtual reality, and, despite both companies' VR devices being excellent, neither seems to have captured the market in way these firms would have liked.

Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n    \n            \n            There's a new Create music button in Gemini.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.When you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\n    \n            \n            You can get some help with your prompting if you need it.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n    \n            \n            You also get cover art with your artificial tunes.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them. The updated Lyria 3 model is also coming to the Dream Track music maker for YouTube Shorts creators. Lyria 3 is now rolling out inside Gemini, and is available to users aged 18 and above in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese. It's available first on the web app, and will show up on the mobile app over the next few days. Expansions in \"quality and coverage\" are planned in the future, Google says.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

One person is also missing, but presumed dead. This story is tragic, but, miraculously, six members of the group survived the disaster. According to the New York Times, those skiers were rescued thanks to a standard iPhone feature, Emergency SOS via satellite, which let them connect to emergency services from where they were trapped by snow. If you have an iPhone, you probably have this feature available to you, as well. Better yet, it's not hard to activate in the event of an emergency, though it doesn't hurt to know exactly how it works ahead of time. This isn't the first time Emergency SOS via satellite was credited with saving lives during disasters, and knowing about it now could potentially save your life in a future emergency. What is Emergency SOS via satellite?You might be familiar with your iPhone's Emergency SOS feature—you may have even set it off accidentally when clicking the buttons too many times in a row. Emergency SOS makes it easy to quickly dial 911 in the event of an emergency. \nBut Emergency SOS via satellite is different. This feature connects you to emergency services when you're in an area with no cellular service. Where a typical 911 call would route through your carrier's network, Emergency SOS via satellite connects your call or message to the nearest satellite above your head. That means, so long as conditions are right, you're able to contact emergency services from basically anywhere in the world, regardless of whether that area is covered by cell networks. Of course, since communications are being routed via satellite, the experience is much different than a standard cellular connection. Apple says that in \"ideal conditions\" with a clear sky, it might take 30 seconds for messages to send. Less ideal conditions, say, if your view of the sky is blocked by trees, could slow a message down to 60 seconds or more.   Apple first launched this feature with the iPhone 14, but since iOS 18, you've been able to text anyone via satellite. The principle is the same, but you can reach out to friends and family rather than 911. If there's an emergency, but not one you need police, fire fighters, or EMTs for, this can connect you to close friends no matter where you are. How to use Emergency SOS via satelliteTo connect to satellite with your iPhone, you'll need an iPhone 14 or later. You'll also need to be running iOS 16.1 in the U.S. and Canada, though other regions have their own software requirements. The feature is currently available in the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S.You won't have the option to connect to satellite services when you have a connection, either cellular or wifi. Instead, the option appears when you have no service. Once this happens, iOS' Connection Assistant will ask if you want to connect to satellite. If you miss the prompt, you can launch it from the Cellular tile in Control Center, or from Settings > Satellite.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce the Connection Assistant launches, it'll walk you through connecting to your nearest satellite, including with on-screen visuals, but here's the gist: You'll need to be outside with as clear a view of the sky as you can. Apple says that \"light\" to \"medium\" foliage from trees could slow down messages, while \"dense\" foliage, hills, mountains, or tall structures could prevent connection at all. Apple says you can hold your iPhone as you usually would—no need to point it at the sky—but you may be instructed to move left or right depending on the location of the satellite. Apple also says the connection might not work in places above 62° latitude, which includes northern parts of Alaska.Once connected, the first thing you should do is try calling 911. The call might go through even over satellite, but if it doesn't, you'll find the option to send an \"Emergency Text.\" Tap this option, then choose the appropriate services (roadside assistance or emergency services.). You can also open the Messages app, text 911, then choose \"Emergency Services.\" Here, tap \"Report Emergency,\" then answer questions when prompted to describe the situation you're in. You can also choose to automatically notify emergency contacts that you contacted 911. From here, your iPhone shares all this information, along with your location, remaining iPhone battery life, and Medical ID (if set up), with responders. Is Emergency SOS via satellite free?Yes! (For now.) Since its launch, Emergency SOS via satellite has been free to use, though Apple officially says that the feature is free for two years after an iPhone is activated. The company pushed back that deadline for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users last year, so no iPhone has actually had to pay for the feature yet. The company might continue to push it back, or begin charging, but there's no word on pricing at this time. It's worth noting T-Mobile has its own satellite feature, as well. If you have the service, and an iPhone 13 or later, you could use their satellite connectivity services instead.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n    ",

That is their lowest price so far, according to price trackers. PCMag gave them an “excellent” rating, largely because they deliver strong sound and active noise cancellation without pushing into premium pricing. At this price, they sit in the crowded midrange category, but they offer a feature set that competes with more expensive earbuds. \nThese IP55-rated earbuds use a dual-driver setup, with 11mm and 6mm drivers working together to produce a wide 10Hz–40kHz range. In practice, that means deep bass that feels full but not bloated, and highs that stay clear instead of sounding harsh.The Buds Pro 3 support Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint connectivity, and codecs like AAC, SBC, and LHDC 5.0 for compatible devices. If you own a recent OnePlus phone, you can access high-res audio and most settings directly through the Bluetooth menu. On other Android or iOS devices, the HeyMelody app unlocks nearly everything, including five EQ presets, a six-band custom EQ, and features like a fit test and Golden Sound tuning (which adjusts the audio profile to match the unique shape of your ear canal).As for its ANC performance, it holds up well for the price. It cuts down low engine rumble on planes and buses and reduces background chatter in busy cafes. That said, its transparency mode (while serviceable) sounds slightly artificial, notes this PCMag review. Battery life is solid but not class-leading. With noise cancellation on, you get up to six hours per charge, plus another 19 hours from the case. Turn ANC off and that jumps to about 10 hours, with 33 more from the case. It charges via USB-C and also supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAt $129.99, these are not flawless, but they cover the essentials well. You get strong sound and noise cancellation, and a long list of features that are often reserved for pricier models.te\n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

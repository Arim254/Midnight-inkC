That means scammers are also busy contacting people, impersonating insurance providers in an effort to collect personal, financial, and medical information.Fraudsters especially love to impersonate representatives from Medicare, targeting older adults and others who qualify for the federal program with unexpected calls. As the Federal Trade Commission warns, scammers may have some of your personal information already and will ask you to confirm your Medicare, bank account, and/or credit card number under the guise of sending you a new Medicare card. In reality, Medicare cards are free and sent automatically, so you should never need to provide payment. Scammers may also target consumers on Marketplace, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans with a similar tactic, claiming that you may lose or be disqualified from health coverage unless you make a payment. \nIn addition to impersonating government officials, bad actors will pretend to represent a legitimate insurer, promising discounted plans (that are available only for a limited time) or enrollment assistance (for a fee). Plans that seem too good to be true probably aren't health insurance at all and may not provide the coverage promised. And you shouldn't have to pay anyone to sign up for a plan.  Note that while scammers may ramp up efforts during open enrollment, health insurance scams can happen year-round. A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) advisory warns consumers about common tactics like calls and texts in which scammers—impersonating government agencies or insurance companies—offer health screening, free gifts, or other promotional benefits in exchange for your personal information. Bad actors can pretty easily spoof phone numbers (so it looks like you're getting a call from a reputable insurance provider like Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield) as well as set up phishing websites designed to steal your credentials and financial information. Insurance scam red flagsAs always, unsolicited communication that pressures you to take action is almost always a scam. Medicare representatives will never call, email, or text you to verify information or demand payment, nor will legitimate government officials try to sell you anything or threaten you unless you pay up. If someone claims they represent an insurer and asks for money or sensitive personal information, or if they threaten you with legal action, hang up. Don't share any data, including your social security number, bank account number, or medical history with anyone—that is, unless you have contacted the Medicare office or other legitimate agency directly and first and need to verify your identity. (The number for Medicare is 1-800-MEDICARE, and you can reach a Marketplace representative through HealthCare.gov). Always verify a representative's identity using official contact information found on a .gov website, legitimate company page, or an account statement, and never send money via gift card, prepaid debit, or crytocurrency in exchange for anything. You should also ensure your credentials for your insurance accounts (like HealthCare.gov and Medicare.gov) are strong and secure, and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

If you download an app that's useful on your phone, there's a good chance you'll also want that app on your tablet, or even your Chromebook. Likewise, if you no longer find an app useful on one device, you likely won't want to keep it on your other devices, either.It can be annoying, however, to uninstall the app from each of your devices individually. Maybe you're using the app on your smartphone and you decide to delete it, but forget to delete it on your other devices. It might live on your tablet or Chromebook for a while before you realize you want it gone. That's annoying, but, in extreme cases, it can also be risky: Maybe you're trying to delete an app that was later discovered to be malicious, but if it still lives on your other devices, it might end up causing you harm. While there has been a way to remotely uninstall apps on other devices, it's been buried in the \"Manage apps and device\" section, and isn't all that easy to execute.The latest update to the Play Store aims to fix that problem. As spotted by Android Authority, with version 48.8, the Play Store now lets you simply uninstall apps from your other devices using your smartphone. Once you're running this version of the Play Store (as well as future versions), you can visit an app's Play Store page and look for a new \"Available on more devices\" section. Here, you'll see all of your connected Android devices, with options to either \"Uninstall\" or \"Install\" the app on those devices. There's no longer the need to dig through your settings.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis feature should make it easy to keep your Android ecosystem a bit more ordered and organized, but it's not the only improvement the Play Store is rolling out. Starting next year, Google will start penalizing apps that use too much battery power. The Play Store will either remove those apps from discoverability pages, or add an alert to the apps' Play Store pages, warning users these apps take up more battery than necessary.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It saves me a lot of money and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.The AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

You won't get access to the Phone app's latest AI features, but if all you want is a reliable way to record phone calls, you'll be set. Google announced this new rollout back in September, calling the ability to record calls a \"fundamentally useful feature,\" even without transcription or automatic note taking. That's certainly true: While the idea of recording phone calls might strike some as nefarious, there are many legitimate applications for recording phone calls, from journalists seeking a record of an phone interview, to patients calling their healthcare providers to make sure they keep track of all medical advice and instruction. Call recording on Android—especially on Google's Pixel devices—has had a turbulent past. While there was once a time you could download a third-party call recorder app without issue, Google started slowly taking away key functions from developers, like blocking access to recordings from microphones. In 2022, the company announced that was blocking access to Android's Accessibility API, the main workaround developers used for their apps—effectively killing the third-party call recorder market. If your phone's manufacturer supported call recording in their primary app, that was still OK, but if not, you basically lost this functionality. \nWith Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, Google offers a feature called Call Notes, which transcribes and summarizes your calls using Gemini. In addition to these AI enhancements, however, you still receive a recording of the phone call, making these two Pixel series the only ones with the capability. That's why this call recording expansion is so necessary.Call recording on Pixel isn't perfectThere are two key caveats to keep in mind with this feature, however. First, don't expect to record a call without the other party's permission. Even if you live in a region with one-party consent—meaning you don't need both parties to agree to the recording—Google's call recorder will announce that it is about to record the call. Unless the other party isn't paying attention, they will know you're recording—and could choose to hang up the line if they feel uncomfortable. Second, this feature won't be available to all Pixel users, even if you have the proper Pixel device. This feature will only work in regions where call recording is legal, and Google says it is rolling out the functionality to all countries that support it throughout the rest of this year. It seems as of this article, the United States and Canada have the feature, but many other countries do not. If you live somewhere where call recording is legal, but don't see this feature yet, sit tight: It's likely rolling out soon. How to set up call recording on PixelTo start, make sure you're using a Pixel 6 or newer, running at least Android 14, or a non-Pixel device running at least Android 9. Next, update your Phone app to the latest version.Now, open the Phone app's Settings, then head to Call Assist > Call Recording. Here, you can turn on the toggle next to \"Turn on Call Recording.\" You can also toggle on \"Automatically record calls with non-contacts,\" if you want the app to start recording whenever someone outside your contacts list calls, or \"Automatically record calls with these numbers\" to manually select contacts you'd like the Phone app to record conversations for. You can choose to automatically delete these recordings after seven, 14, or 30 days, or let them stay on your phone forever. You can skip those latter two options, however, if you'd rather make recordings a case-by-case basis. If so, whenever you're in a call, you can choose the Call Assist button to select \"Call Recording.\" (If this is your first recording, you'll need to download some audio files before you're able to record calls.) When you do, the Phone app will ask if you'd like to record the call, which you can agree to. There is then a short countdown before the system alerts everyone on the call that it will begin recording. You can stop the recording at any time from the Call Assist menu. You'll find your new recording in the Home tab.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

When I tried to load sites like X, ChatGPT, or, ironically, Downdetector, I was met with various errors. X showed me an internal service error, while Downdetector asked me to \"Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.\" (I definitely do not have that authority.) You may experience similar errors on websites you try to load this morning, even ones you don't regularly visit. As part of this article, for example, I would google queries and click the top results to websites I had never heard of before, only to encounter similar error messages. That's because a large portion of the global internet relies on Cloudflare to operate. Cloudflare offers a host of services to companies, including web infrastructure and cybersecurity products. As such, when Cloudflare goes down, so do many of those websites—a bit of a domino effect.\nIt's not clear at this time what brought on the outage, but, as spotted by Techradar, Cloudflare had announced scheduled maintenance for some of its web servers for Nov. 18, ranging from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. UTC (7am to 10am ET), so it's possible something happened during this work to break service. The good news is, it appears that many of these sites are back up and running—at least, at this time. At 8:09 a.m. ET, Cloudflare reported it had identified the issue, and was working on a fix. At 9:42 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it rolled out the fix, and that the company believes the incident is resolved—though the official status page still says the Cloudflare Global Network is experiencing issues. While this is indeed a big interruption to the internet, it's far from the first time this has happened. In fact, an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage broke the internet last month. With the Cloudflare outage this morning, it's an example of the risks of so many companies putting their web services needs in the same basket: If one servicer goes, so too goes a huge fraction of the web. Cloudflare will likely patch this issue sometime Tuesday, so I imagine we'll all be back to business as usual soon enough. I'll keep this article updated with developments as they come. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Back in the Windows XP days, when the only search functionality was a cartoon dog in the sidebar of Windows Explorer (not a joke), Google released Google Desktop. If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.Finally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        MacOS is great in all kinds of ways, but it's far from the most customizable operating system out there. Sure, it's not locked down to the extent iOS and iPadOS are, but compared to Linux and even Windows, macOS really doesn't let you change the look and feel very much.But that isn't to say there's no room to tweak the operating system to make it the way you like—if you know where to look. Here are a few third-party tools that let you make macOS your own.Use a custom cursorIt's pretty easy to change how the mouse pointer looks on Windows and Linux—you just need to dig around in the settings. On macOS, you can only change the size of the pointer.\nUnless, that is, you install the free and open source Mousecape. This application lets you create a cursor, then use it in place of the default system ones. You can also install cursors made by others. There's no centralized collection of cursors for this, unfortunately, but I found a fun hand on Github, some Wii cursors, and a decent collection on DeviantArt. You could also try your hand at creating your own set.Note that Tahoe users will have to download an updated fork in order to use Mousecape—the main build doesn't work at the moment. You'll need to install a pre-release download as of this writing.Use any website as your wallpaper\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nSome great wallpapers, including dynamic ones, are included with macOS. There's also the option to use your own photos. But what macOS doesn't offer are custom, animated wallpapers.Enter Plash. This free application lets you turn any website into a macOS wallpaper, which opens up all kinds of interactive possibilities. A few sites included let you look out a random stranger's window, see real-time weather data, or take in some animated pixel art, but you can use any website you can think of. It's a lot of fun to play around with.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe macOS menu bar is a bit of a mess. Windows makes it relatively easy to hide icons by dragging them to a secondary area. Apple hasn't offered anything like this until Tahoe, which added a way to disable any icon in the settings. The problem: it's all or nothing. Hide an icon in the settings and there's no quick way to access it other than going back into the settings and turning it back on.For that, you'll need a third party app. I personally recommend Ice, which is the best free app for cleaning up your menu bar. My coworker Pranay recommends Barbee, another great option. Both make it easy to hide menu bar icons in a secondary bar accessible by hitting an icon, similar to how it works on Windows. Every Mac user should install some sort of tool like this.Change your folder icons\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThis one isn't unofficial, exactly, but it's so buried it might as well be. You can change the icon for any folder, document, or even application by right-clicking it, clicking \"Get Info\", then dragging an image to the icon in the window that opens. Weird, right? But it works, meaning you can customize folders to look however you want. I talked about this in an article with more details.This gets really fun if you install Fancy Folders, a free application seen in the image above which allows you to create folder icons in the color of your choice, complete with either the text or icon of your choice. It's a lot of fun to play with, and can be very useful for visually keeping things organized.\n            ",

Websites from X to ChatGPT went offline as Cloudflare, the company they rely on for web infrastructure services, experienced a massive outage. A huge number of sites and services across the world contract Cloudflare for cybersecurity protections, as well as to route traffic through servers local to each user, all in the name of performance and reliability. Ironic, of course, given today's events.When the public experiences such a massive internet outage, speculation runs awry. What caused this? Was it a simple bug on Cloudflare's part, or something malicious? Are bad actors attacking Cloudflare, and the sites that rely on it? But, as it turns out, the reason appears to be closer to the former than the latter.Cloudflare's outage was a glitchIn a statement to Mashable, Cloudflare confirmed that the company had identified the cause of the issue, and had rolled out a fix to patch it. In addition, Cloudflare is adamant there is no reason to believe a cyberattack caused this outage. This is the full statement: \n\"Many of Cloudflare's services experienced a significant outage today beginning around 11:20 UTC. It was fully resolved at 14:30 UTC. The root cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic. The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services.To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity. We expect that some Cloudflare services will be briefly degraded as traffic naturally spikes post incident but we expect all services to return to normal in the next few hours. A detailed explanation will be posted soon on blog.cloudflare.com. Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable. We apologize to our customers and the Internet in general for letting you down today. We will learn from today's incident and improve.\" It seems the reason for the outage was a preventative measure meant to block a potential cyberattack. While that goal is obviously important, it shows how complex these systems really are: One glitch with one cybersecurity protocol spun out of control, and took down the network en masse.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Whether you actually go back and look at photos, watch videos, or review files from years past, you may someday be disappointed if those memories disappear forever, either because you didn't back them up or your one backup was destroyed along the way. I know I have done a poor job of keeping track of media as I have upgraded computers and phones over the years, and I've lost my fair share of photos, videos, and documents along the way, whether on misplaced or damaged external drives or from simply forgetting to back up at all. Here's how to ensure your data is available for years to come. \nYou need multiple backups of your dataOne approach to backing up your data is the 3-2-1 strategy, which says you should keep three copies of your data across two different forms of storage, one of which should be offsite (in case a disaster strikes your home). A simple example: You have your photos and files on your computer, which is backed up regularly to both an external hard drive and a cloud service. That's three copies of your data on two storage types—an onsite physical device and remote cloud storage—the latter of which satisfies the \"offsite\" requirement because it is geographically separate from your other two copies. This approach protects against a single point of failure, such as a primary device dying, losing an external hard drive, or getting locked out of a cloud account. When it comes to backing up your data, redundancy matters. As Reddit users note, there are different interpretations of how to apply the 3-2-1 rule, such as whether your working copy on your primary device counts as one of three and whether the one offsite copy is included in the two forms of storage. And while a strict 3-2-1 strategy, or variations of it, may be more commonly employed at the enterprise level rather than by the average consumer, you could think about it as a general guideline for improving your backup system, especially if you don't have one at all. How to set up backupsYou never know when a device might fail, so it's a good idea to plan frequent backups, whether your data is syncing regularly to the cloud or you set reminders to manually push updates to your external hard drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany users sync their devices automatically to a service like iCloud or Google Drive, but relying on this as your sole backup doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to access all of your files in the future. As HowtoGeek points out, these backups are typically mirroring what's currently on your device rather than historical versions—so once you delete a photo, file, or folder from your computer or phone, it's also deleted from the cloud backup. This is useful for quick access as well as restoring to a new or factory-reset device, but it doesn't do much for the scores of media collected over the years that you don't use daily. You could use a dedicated cloud backup service like IDrive or Backblaze, which come with a lot of storage space for automatic, full device backups. This may be best for users who have large files or a lot of media that is essential to their jobs as well as those who prioritize data privacy. (However, Wirecutter notes that most online backup services leave a lot to be desired.) Others may be fine to manually move files and media to free or low-cost cloud storage, including iCloud, OneDrive, and Google. At a minimum, another backup should live on an external hard drive—and if you're not going to do cloud backups, consider two external drives stored in separate locations. Hardware can obviously be lost, stolen, damaged, or simply degraded over time, so again, you shouldn't rely on a single drive for all of your storage. Apple's Time Machine and Windows File History make it easy to save backups to an external drive. \n            ",

If you tried to follow your feeds on X, or engage with ChatGPT, you were only met with error messages. Compare those error messages to one another, however, and you'd likely notice a similar name affixed to them all: Cloudflare. Cloudflare's massive Tuesday morning outage had sweeping implications for much of the web. While it's not clear what caused the outage at this time, we do know whether the outage was responsible for a website's downtime. (When an error page says \"Cloudflare: Error,\" it's not difficult to track down the source of the problem.) As Cloudflare offers web infrastructure services to a huge number of sites, the true list of affected sites is likely massive. As an example, I wanted to convert the timezone Cloudflare uses in its status reports, UTC, to ET, and the first website I clicked on in my Google search returned an error. While there's no central repository listing each and every affected website, we can look at the sites with the largest number of user reports indicating issues this morning through Downdetector. (Disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Lifehacker.) Ironically, Downdetector itself was down this morning—it too uses Cloudflare.\nDowndetector is not a service that investigates and reports websites that are down. Instead, users can self-report issues with sites on Downdetector. As such, it can be illuminating to see which sites visitors were having issues with during the period of time Cloudflare was down. At this time, that includes the following:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nXCloudflareOpenAIChatGPTGrindrArchive of Our OwnAWSSpotifyLeague of LegendseClinicalWorksQuizletUberCharacter.aiCanvaClaudeVaroIndeedProcoreTruth SocialFanFictionArloDoorDashValorantRunescapeDayforceNJTransitSniffiesSquareGoogleZoomRoverCollegeBoardLetterboxd  Bet365MoneyLionDayZBetMGMYouTubeMicrosoftIKEASunoMicrosoft 365Canvas by InstructureMicrosoft TeamsAmazonGrokInstagramGeminiAgain, this list is not definitive, nor is it official.

Because so many of the new model's biggest features are hidden behind paywalls, it's not a bad deal, even if it's not the first time Google's done this. The deal follows similar promotions from April and August, although the most recent one ended in October. That this offer is coming so soon after the last one means Google might plan to keep rolling out these trials on a regular basis.How to claim your free year of Google AI Pro as a U.S. college studentTo get your free year of Google AI Pro, first head over to gemini.google/students and click Get Offer. You'll then need to log into your personal Google account, where you'll be prompted to verify your student status using SheerID. After that, Google says it should be a pretty straightforward signup flow, although being over a decade out of college by now, I'm not able to test it personally.Note that you will need to provide a form of payment, and that if you don't cancel the plan by the time the trail is over, your subscription will renew using your provided payment method. You also only have until January 31, 2026 to sign up for the trail.\nThe most likely error you're likely to run into is if your college isn't supported by the trial, which is handled by SheerID. Neither Google nor SheerID are being upfront about which institutions are and aren't supported, but Google says that if you run into issues, you can contact [email protected] or go to the SheerID help center.You also have to be older than 18, which means some freshman might have trouble signing up, and you cannot be on a supervised Google Account, or currently have a Google One subscription through either family sharing or a third party affiliate. Google says you can cancel an existing paid AI Pro plan to swap it for the trial, but you can't try to subscribe using the trial while applying a discount from buying a Pixel phone (which would theoretically apply after the free period ends).There's also some conflicting communication online. The current offer terms state you must \"be a resident of the United States,\" although the current help page for the trial still refers to previous offers, which were offered to other regions as well. I've reached out to Google for clarification, but for now, I would assume the offer only applies to those in the U.S. and expires on January 31, given the information in the Gemini 3 Pro press release.I've also reached out to Google about whether students who've already claimed the free year-long trial can extend their offer time by signing up for the new one, as while the help page mentions that \"new and existing Google one members,\" are eligible, it's unclear whether those already on a free trial count as proper subscribers. I'd guess the answer is probably no, but I'll let you know if Google tells me otherwise.What you get with your free year of Google AI ProYour free year of Google AI Pro comes with a free year of Google One Premium, too, which means it's got some benefits for you even if you're skeptical about AI.For AI users, Google AI Pro offers the following:Higher usage limits for deep research and recent models like Gemini 3 ProGemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3 Pro in AI ModeVideo generation with Veo 3.1 Fast and higher access to Google Flow and image-to-video generation in Veo 3.More remix generations and Veo 3 photo-to-video generations in Google photos1,000 monthly AI creditsIncreased NotebookLM accessHigher limits in coding tools including Jules, Gemini Code Assist, Gemini CLIGoogle Home Premium with Gemini features and 30 days of event historyFor everyone else, you'll still get 2TB of free cloud storage through Google One, which should be handy for all those assignments. Normally, when signing up for a Google One Premium Plan, you also have the option to bundle a YouTube Premium individual plan for a 14% discount, although it's unclear to me whether that's included in the trial, so I've also reached out to Google for clarity on this.And that's it! Personally, I wouldn't see myself using most of those AI features, but the 2TB of cloud storage is good enough that it's probably worth signing up for the trial just for that. Just remember to either be ready to pay the $20/month price once your year is up, or cancel before then.

One of the most popular cloud gaming services is Nvidia's GeForce Now, which lets you play select free-to-play titles and PC games you already own using the company's own data centers. The catch is that you either have to watch ads or pay up—but today, Google's Chromebooks are getting an exclusive new tier of GeForce Now that fixes both of these issues.Called GeForce Now Fast Pass, this version of GeForce Now is sort of like an expanded version of the existing free tier. You'll still be limited to playing at 1080p and 60fps—higher specs will require you to pay—and you won't have access to GeForce Now's \"Install-to-Play\" games, which means the library of compatible titles will be closer to 2,000 than 4,000. But unlike the free tier, you won't have to watch any ads, and you won't have to wait in a queue to start playing. Nvidia says the typical free-tier queue is only two minutes long, but hey, the sooner you can hop into the action, the better.\nStarting today, all new Chromebook purchases will come with a free year of GeForce Now Fast Pass, but there are some caveats. The big one is that you only get 10 free Fast Pass hours per month, although up to five unused hours will roll over to the next month.That means you'll still have to keep track of your time while playing, even if you don't have to watch ads. A Google spokesperson told me over email that once your Fast Pass hours are up, you'll be downgraded to the basic, ad-supported free tier, or you can purchase more Fast Pass hours a la carte. I wasn't told exactly how much these hours will cost, but given that a day pass (meaning 24 hours of play) of GeForce Now with no ads and higher specs than Fast Pass costs just $3.99, I can't imagine they'll be too expensive.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for when your year of Fast Pass is over, I'm still waiting for an answer on how to renew. I'll update this post once I hear back. I've also asked whether users that already have Chromebooks will be able to sign up for GeForce Now Fast Pass.One last bonus for Fast Pass, though, is that you don't have to actually use it on your Chromebook. You'll need a Chromebook to sign up (I'm also still waiting on exact steps for that), but once you've redeemed the offer, you'll be able to use it on any GeForce Now compatible device, like a phone or tablet.Overall, it doesn't exactly seem like something I'd go out of my way to buy a Chromebook for, but it could be a decent way to get good enough performance to play through about one short game per month, all without having to pay for GeForce Now or deal with ads or wait times. Combine that with the free games that sites like Epic give out on a regular basis, and you could essentially game casually for a year without buying anything other than your Chromebook. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In its November fraud and scam advisory, Google is warning users about VPN apps and extensions that appear legitimate but are actually vectors for malware.VPNs may actually be spyware A VPN, or virtual private network, makes your internet activity much more difficult to track by routing your traffic through a different connection rather than your regular internet service provider (ISP). This allows you to hide your IP address and location, obscure your browsing data, and protect your information and devices from bad actors. According to Google, malicious VPNs (posing as real ones) are delivering infostealers, remote access trojans, and banking trojans to user devices once installed, allowing hackers to access sensitive personal data like browsing history, financial credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet information. This means that an app you rely on to keep your information private could be doing the exact opposite. Cybercriminals are capitalizing on user trust in these services, creating apps that look and feel like legitimate VPNs but are actually dangerous spyware. \nHow to ensure your VPN app is safeAs with any app or extension, only download or install a VPN from an official source like the Google Play store. While malicious programs do sometimes sneak through, it's typically safer and more reliable than sideloading through a messaging app or other unvetted site. In January 2025, Google launched a VPN verification process to help users identify trustworthy VPN apps in the Google Play store. To earn a \"verified\" badge, VPN apps have to undergo a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation and opt into independent security reviews. Badges are awarded only to VPNs that have been published for at least 90 days and reach 10,000 installs and 250 user reviews. Of course, this system isn't perfect either: As TechRadar reported earlier this year, a popular (free) Chrome VPN extension earned a badge and was later discovered to be spying on users. That's why you should rely on a reputable VPN service—which means you'll likely have to pay for it. Free VPNs are far more likely to a privacy nightmare, and any app that sounds too good to be true probably is. You aren't going to get unlimited traffic at no cost without sacrificing something. Finally, review VPN permissions carefully, and allow the minimum access possible for the app or extension to function. (You should do this with any app you download, and you should audit apps regularly to remove unnecessary permissions.) You can check your VPN service's support pages to find out which permissions are essential—this should not include access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or photos, for example. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        There are plenty of distractions to deal with in our modern digital age—see if you can manage to get all the way through this article without turning your attention elsewhere at least once, for example. All that surrounding noise can make it difficult to stick to the task at hand, and actually get some solid work done.I enjoy browsing social media and exploring the web as much as the next person, but I've also got plenty of writing to get through every day, and distractions can seriously slow me down. Studies have shown that we do much better when we focus on one task at a time, which for me is writing guides and articles.While distraction-free devices such as the Freewrite Smart Typewriter have always appealed, I wanted to be more focused while using my MacBook Air. To that end, I've come up with a strategy for minimizing distractions as much as possible, and it's something you might find helpful for your own work.\nThese steps apply specifically to macOS and Google Docs, which is what I use for most of my writing, but you can adapt them for Windows and other word processors too.Turn off notifications\n    \n            \n            Focus modes are an easy way to manage notifications.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNotifications is a good place to start—if your laptop is continually pinging and alerting you to other things, it's hard to get anything done. On macOS, notification settings can be handled by clicking the Apple icon (top left), then System Settings > Notifications. Here you can set alerts on an app-by-app basis.For me, the Focus entry in System Settings is even more useful. Here I've set up a dedicated Work focus mode that blocks all notifications from all apps, and leaves me in peace. To create your own mode, click Add Focus on the main list—you can either set them to run on a schedule, or enable them manually via Focus in the Control Center (click the toggle switches on the menu bar, top right, to access them).For the best results, you need to silence your phone as well, which is likely to be interrupting you even more than your laptop. If you're using an iPhone, you can sync Focus modes across both macOS and iOS, by enabling the Share across devices toggle switch on the main Focus options screen.Tweak your writing software\n    \n            \n            Google Docs has a few tricks for distraction-free writing.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEven without notifications enabled, it's easy to catch sight of something else you could be doing on your laptop, rather than concentrating on a single task. Explore the various options available within your word processor of choice to make the interface as minimal as possible—which in my case involves tweaking the look of Google Docs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo get the same effect on your own Google Docs documents, first head to the View menu and make sure the ruler, equation toolbar, and spelling and grammar suggestions are all hidden (for me, they just add to the on-screen clutter). Then, open the Format menu and choose Switch to pageless format to get one long, flowing page.Next, select View and pick Full screen, and then maximize the browser window in macOS using the green button up in the top left corner. Hey presto—all you've got on screen now are your words, with nothing else to distract you. To bring back the Google Docs menus and toolbars, press Esc to exit maximized mode, move the cursor to the top of the screen and click the green button again.Turn off the internet\n    \n            \n            Turn off wifi to reduce distractions further.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFor the most extreme version of a distraction-free writing device—heading back to the days of the typewriter—I block internet access on my laptop too (on macOS, you can just click the wifi symbol on the menu bar, top right, then toggle off Wi-Fi). Sure, it's not the most comprehensive way of blocking the internet, but it works for me, and makes me think twice about going online (yes, Google Docs can work offline).I find it makes me less likely to check the news, social media, or email when I should be writing. The obvious problem is that I can't look up anything online either, so it's a bit of a soft rule I have—I try to at least write certain chunks of articles while offline, then do all my online research at once, and without opening dozens of browser tabs.You can tailor this to suit yourself, but I've found switching off the internet makes me more likely to rely on my own thoughts and word choices—without recourse to a dictionary or thesaurus. Sometimes it's good to give your brain a bit of exercise, and get it to slow down and focus for a while.\n            ",

Spotify is doing its best to fix at least one of those problems, by testing AI recaps for some of its audiobooks.It's the first new AI-powered feature in a while that I would actually use. In fact, I've played a few video games with similar features (not powered by AI, admittedly), and it's always such a value-add that it makes me pine for it in pretty much every other piece of media I engage with.Here's how Spotify's new feature works: First, you unfortunately do need to be using the Spotify app for iOS, so Android, web, or desktop listeners are out of luck, at least during this beta test. Then, you'll need to have listened to a supported English language audiobook for at least 15-20 minutes. After that, you'll see a Recap button at the top of the page that will quickly generate a one- to two-minute-long summary of what's happened in the book so far, which Spotify promises will be spoiler-free for future plot events. \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nPreviously on [your book]Spotify's likening it to a \"previously on\" segment on a TV show, although it also says that, \"Recaps do not replicate narration or replace the original audiobook in any way,\" so don't expect to hear actual clips from the book, nor an AI voice trying to mimic the narrator. However, just as TV's \"previously on\" segments will change with new episodes, your AI Recap will be \"regularly updated to match your progress.\"As for any potential issues with the feature, the company says it is \"not using audiobook content for LLM training purposes or voice generation\" and that authors can opt out of having Recaps on their books. Still, there are a few caveats, including the fact that the Recap feature isn't free.On the plus side, it is included alongside the free audiobook hours you get with Spotify Premium, as well as any add-on hours you might buy. But otherwise, audiobooks on Spotify need to be bought on a per-book basis, so for users without Spotify Premium and with no audiobooks in their libraries (that's me), there's no way to try AI Recaps before you buy, which means it's maybe not a convincing reason to swap audiobook platforms just yet.Not all books will get RecapsSpotify's also not being upfront about which books have Recaps, so it could be a bit before you see the button pop up for you. So while I like the idea in theory, I'm probably not going to get to test it anytime soon. (I've reached out to Spotify to ask for a current list of books with Recaps enabled, and will update this article when I hear back.)Could Recaps include hallucinations?Another potential issue with these Recaps: hallucinations. Spotify didn't address accuracy at all in its announcement, which I'd like to think implies the company is feeling pretty confident it won't be an issue. But there is still a potential for an AI to misreport specific details of your story, or accidentally slip a spoiler in regardless of what Spotify claims. One would hope your memory would be jogged enough by a general outline to catch inconsistencies, but still, it might be worth keeping a few notes while you read, just in case.How to get AI summaries for any book (without using Spotify)If you aren't a Spotify audiobook listener or just haven't gotten to try the beta, I'll give you a cheat: You can already ask other AI chatbots for book summaries for free. So long as you remember where you left off, just head over to your AI of choice and ask for a summary up to that point. Here's one for the opening chapters of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt (via ChatGPT)\n                    \n    \nI won't deny that there's real convenience in having a summary feature baked directly into your app, especially one that doesn't require you to cross reference where you left off lest you, I don't know, spoil the Red Wedding for yourself or something. But if you're like me (not a Spotify audiobook customer), at least you're not out of options.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

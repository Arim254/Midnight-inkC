Modern TVs are basically computers, complete with their own operating systems and application ecosystems. That means you can tweak them to run better.—or just the way you want them to. Here are a few tips, tricks, and hacks that every smart TV owner should be aware of.Turn off motion smoothing on your smart TVWondering why every single TV show and movie you watch on your brand new TV looks like a soap opera or a cheap community theater production? It's probably because of motion smoothing.This \"feature\", which is the default on far too many TVs, artificially ups the frame rate from either 24 or 30 frames per second to 60 or 120 frames, or even higher. This effect can bring a real immediacy to live events like sports, but it's not great for regular old TV shows. Because where does the TV get those extra frames from? It makes them up, often creating an uncanny blurring effect reminiscent of old school videotape. I recommend turning this feature off basically the minute you set up your TV, and our friends at PCMag have a guide to disabling the feature covering all the major smart TV platforms.Hook up an ethernet cable to make your smart TV faster Streaming 4k takes up a lot of bandwidth. Modern wifi routers can usually handle without much of an issue, especially if your TV is close to your router. Even so, it's a good idea to physically connect your smart TV to your network with an ethernet cable if you have the option.There's a couple of reasons to do this. One, wired connections are more stable, mostly because they're not vulnerable to interference from neighboring wireless networks and other devices, so you'll be far less like to suffer through stuttering images or audio dropouts. Two, connecting your TV via ethernet frees up the wireless spectrum for all of your other devices, which is important if you live in a house with other internet users (not to mention other smart devices).Customize your smart TV's home screenSmart TVs tend to come pre-loaded with any number of apps, all of them prominently placed on the home screen. You can, and should, move the apps you actually use to the top instead. How to do this will vary depending on your operating system, but it generally means pressing and holding on the app you want was at the top of the list and then moving it around. Failing that, you may need to do some digging in the settings.Block ads on your smart TVTired of all the ads showing up on your TV? You might be able to block them using your router. Lifehacker has a guide to blocking ads on Samsung, LG, and Roku smart TVs that explains how to change your internet settings so that your TV can't access the ads in the interface anymore.Disable quick start to save energy and speed up your smart TVSmart TVs are basically computers, meaning they need to boot up when you turn them on. Most users don't want to wait every time they turn on the TV though, which is why smart TVs don't actually turn off—they suspend their functions, the same way your phone or laptop does. That's fine if you use your TV constantly, but a real waste of electricity for a TV that you only turn on occasionally. And shutting down your set completely could have another benefit: reducing bugginess. To reiterate, a smart TV is basically a computer, and every computer user knows that restarting your computer can fix random problems.Some TVs allow you to disable this feature—just look for a \"quick start\" option in the settings. Others, including Sony, suggest that you unplug TVs you won't be using for months at a time in order to shut them down completely.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse an antenna to get free channelsStreaming television is great, but don't overlook traditional broadcast TV. Most major cultural events, from the Super Bowl, to the Oscars, to the World Series, are still free to watch on network TV, as are of the most popular shows. If you live in a major city, or even just close to one, there's a good chance you can watch network TV free of charge using nothing more than a small TV antenna. This can mean free access to stations like NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and PBS—no need to pay for cable or a pricey \"live tv\" streaming subscription. All you need to do is plug in an antenna, scan for channels, and you're good to go. (Lifehacker has a guide to the best digital TV antennas to help you get started.)Clear your smart TV's cacheNot to keep harping on this point, but a smart TV is a computer, and like a computer, it can build up all sorts of junk in its memory over time. If your smart TV is suddenly moving more slowly than you remember, or even crashing, it might be time to clear out its various caches. Get started with this guide to clearing the cache on every major smart TV brand.Enable security features on your smart TVYour smart TV is a potential security risk. It's a computer, like any other, and that means you need to keep it up to date, secure all accounts connected to it, and be mindful of any built-in microphones and cameras. Check out our guide to securing your smart TV for more on these tips and more.Disable \"automatic content recognition\" to stop your smart TV from spying on youI've written about why smart TVs are so cheap, and it turns out a big part of it is automatic content recognition, or ACR. Most brands of smart TVs are constantly monitoring what you're watching and using that to build a profile with your viewing habits that can be sold to third parties, a practice that nets the TV manufacturers are lot of money. If this concerns you, consider turning the feature off to protect your privacy. Lifehacker has a guide to disabling ACR on the major smart TV platforms.Install a different launcher for your smart TVIf you want your smart TV to have an entirely different look and feel, you may be able to install a different launcher, which will give you much more control. Google TV users, for example, can install Projectivy to completely replace the default launcher. This won't be an option for every model of smart TV, but it's worth considering if you're feeling stuck with the software that came preinstalled.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

Way too many applications want to put icons in the top-right corner of the screen, and most users only want to see a fraction of those. This is a particular problem on recent MacBooks, where the camera notch blacks out a chunk of space right in the middle of the menu bar. This is why applications for cleaning up the Mac menu bar are so popular—the clutter can feel overwhelming.Here's the thing, though: You probably don't need to leave applications like that running constantly. You can hide icons in macOS' Settings, then use a free tool once to move all the icons closer together. Here's how.How to hide icons in Mac System SettingsTahoe, also known as macOS 26, gave users a lot to talk about, which meant a few features were broadly overlooked. One of them: the ability to hide any menu bar icon, no third party software required. To use this feature open System Settings and head to the Menu Bar section. You will see the ability to toggle system icons, like Siri and Spotlight, on and off. Keep scrolling, though, and you'll find the ability to hide icons for any of your installed applications. Just toggle off any application you'd rather not see in the menu bar and it will disappear.\nI've been using this to disable unwanted icons for months, and it's working well for me. Having said that, though, it isn't a perfect replacement. Applications like Bartender and Ice don't just hide icons—they give you access to a secondary tray where you can still occasionally access icons you hid. There's no quick way to do that using the macOS settings. Still: It's a free way to hide unwanted icons, and there's no need to keep third party software running.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf your menu bar still feels crowded, you can free up a bit more space by squeezing all of your icons together. A free application called Menu Bar Spacing lets you change the spacing in your menu bar. Just download the application, move the slider, and your icons will move closer together.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe great thing about Menu Bar Spacing, as an application, is that it doesn't need to run constantly. You can launch it once, make the changes you like, and then delete it—your setting will still apply. This is because the application changes a few hidden macOS settings. You can make the changes yourself using the Terminal if you prefer not to use an app, but I think the app makes things a little bit easier.There's a bit of a caveat for macOS 26 users. Because of a bug, only Apple's own icons will move closer together at first. Your other applications will need to be restarted before they bunch closer together. That means you'll need to manually close and re-launch each application, or simply restart your Mac. It's annoying, but only relevant right after you change the settings. And you'll have a lot more space on your menu bar once you're done.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to the settlement website, class payment distribution began on Jan. 23, and many users on Reddit report that funds have landed in their bank and payment apps over the last several days. If you see a deposit from \"Lopez Voice Assistant\" or some variation, it's not a scam. The settlement allowed class members to opt for payment via direct deposit (ACH) as well as electronic or paper check, which will be delivered through email or regular mail, respectively. Some class members are reporting that they received their funds via a different method than they expected, so if you submitted a claim, keep an eye on your transactions as well as your mailboxes to confirm receipt. Note that payouts are being distributed in batches and may take a few days to arrive. \nWhat is the Apple Siri settlement? Last year, Apple agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over privacy concerns with Siri-enabled devices. Users whose devices may have activated and recorded conversations without their knowledge were able to claim compensation. Initially, the settlement was set to pay out $20 per device—iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV were all eligible—for up to five devices per individual claimant. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, due to the final class size, the payout came to just $8.02 per device up to a maximum of $40.10. If you have questions about the settlement and want to speak with an administrator, you can call 888-981-4106 and select option 0 on the main menu. You may have to leave a message and request a callback. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing. The issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The platform is speedy, simple, and supports just about every streaming app out there.If you've got a Roku or two in your life, you may not be using it to its full potential. These tips, hacks, and hidden features should help you go beyond the basic business of launching your streaming apps and get more out of your hardware, whether you've just unboxed your first Roku device, or you've been using one for years.Set up PIN protection to protect your RokuIf you've got young kids or nosy housemates living with you, you can lock certain parts of the Roku experience (including making purchases and adding new channels) behind a PIN number. This is actually done through your Roku account page on the web: Click PIN/parental controls on the left, and you can set a new PIN or change an existing one.Change the look and feel of your Roku with a new themeYou don't have to settle for the standard Roku interface visuals—you can easily switch to a different theme (which basically means a different wallpaper and screensaver). From Settings on your device, choose Themes to see alternatives provided by Roku and other people in the Roku community. You can always pick Restore default theme to go back to the original look.Enable captions on replayYou might not want closed captions on all the time, but you can have them enabled whenever you skip backward. From the home screen, pick Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode > On replay to enable this. Note that the streaming app you're using needs to support the feature as well, so it may not work everywhere.Put your most-watched apps up topThis is a simple and effective one that you might not have got around to doing: You can organize the apps on the home screen so your most-used are nearer the top and easier to get to. Select any tile on the home screen, press the star button on your remote to bring up the context menu, and you'll see the Move app and Move app to top options.Make use of Guest Mode when you have company\n    \n            \n            Roku devices come with a Guest Mode included.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's great having guests—but don't let them mess up your recommendations and viewing progress. You can put your Roku device into Guest Mode by opening Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Guest Mode > Enter Guest Mode. You'll be signed out of all your apps, and the Roku device will restart ready for someone else to use it.Send your photos to your Roku to view them on the big screenYou won't always be watching films and shows on your Roku of course—and when your streaming device isn't doing anything else you can get images from your Google Photos library up on your TV. To set this up, you need to head to the Photostreams page on the Roku website, sign in using your account, and then follow the instructions online.Set up a cross-platform Roku watchlistThere will often be times when you see something interesting, but don't have time to watch it right away, and that's when the Roku watchlist feature can help. Select any movie or show from the home screen, and on the listing page use the Save button to add it to your list: You can then pick Save List from the main menu to see what you've saved.Pair your Bluetooth headphones to your RokuIf you've got a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and a Roku device that supports Bluetooth, you can pair the two together for some private audio listening— handy if you don't want to disturb anyone around you. You can do this by heading to Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Remotes & devices > Wireless headphones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nListen to your Roku via your smartphoneThere's another way to listen through headphones, and it doesn't require Bluetooth or wireless headphones. If you install the aforementioned Roku app on your smartphone, then plug a pair of headphones into your phone as well, you can tap Remote control in the app and then the headphone button to stream the audio right to your ears.\n    \n            \n            You can use the mobile app to listen over headphones.\n                                        Credit: Roku\n                    \n    \nMirror your other devices to your RokuApple devices: Roku sticks, boxes and TVs come with support for the Apple AirPlay standard built right in, so you can beam across audio and video from Apple devices, or even mirror your Mac display on the big screen. On the Roku, choose Settings then Apple AirPlay and HomeKit to make sure you're set up, then just select the AirPlay button on your Apple hardware.Android devices: For screen casting, you're not left out if you're on Android, though—as usual with Android—capabilities vary between devices. Samsung Galaxy phones have the smoothest integration: Swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen, choose Smart View, and your Roku should show up as a connection option (if it's on the same wifi network).Windows devices: If you want to mirror your screen to a Roku from Windows, the process is different again. First, enable the feature on the Roku via Settings > System > Screen mirroring. Next, from Windows, click the volume and wifi icons down in the lower right corner, click the Display button, then select your Roku. Again, it needs to be on the same wifi network.Quickly find the cheapest way to rent a show or movieIf you're in the mood for a movie rental, then you've got a whole host of different streaming services to choose from—all the big ones offer film rentals on top of the content you get with your subscription. Use the Search option from the main Roku menu to look for a title, and compare the different prices across all the services you're signed up to.Control your TV with your Roku remoteYou can turn your TV on and off and adjust its volume with your Roku remote, if you'd like to. You're asked if you want to do this when you first set up your Roku device, but you can configure it afterwards too: Pick Settings > Remotes & devices > Remotes, then choose the remote you've currently got connected, and then pick Set up remote for TV control.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Walking is an easy way to get some exercise in your day, and it delivers mental health benefits as well. I’m one of the many people who added daily walks to my routine during the pandemic, and they improved my life so much I don’t intend to stop. But does walking do enough for your body that you can count it as cardio exercise? The answer is complicated. Walking counts as cardio in some respects: it can burn calories, it gets your heart rate up, and it counts toward the exercise we should all be getting every week. But on the other hand, it’s not going to increase your cardio fitness in the same way as a run or an intense aerobics class would. If you want to improve your endurance, you’ll have to do more than just walk. How walking’s calorie burn compares to runningRunning burns more calories than walking per unit time, but both are similar when you consider distance. \nA rule of thumb is that you burn about 100 calories per mile whether you run it or walk it, but in truth calorie burn varies according to the size of your body (you burn more calories if you are larger) and how fast you run or walk. The calories per mile are slightly lower when you walk. This calculator estimates that a 150-pound person will burn 108 calories by walking a mile at 3 miles per hour, or 104 calories by running it at 6 miles per hour. Some calculators give a lower estimate for walking, The bigger difference is in calories per hour (rather than calories per mile): for the same 150-pound person, walking burns 324 calories per hour, and running burns 627. The faster you go, the higher the calorie burn. So if you’re walking or running to burn calories, running will burn about double the calories in a given time. But if you prefer walking and you have the time to spare, both will do the job. Walking can’t replace “vigorous” cardioEach intensity level of exercise offers its own benefits. Walking is what I’d consider very easy cardio, jogging is more of a medium exercise, and high-intensity cardio would be something like sprinting or racing. All of these are good for you, although depending on your goals, you may not need to do all of them. If you want to be a fast runner, for example, you’ll need plenty of medium cardio (slow running) and some higher intensity stuff (speedwork); if you want to improve your endurance, as measured by metrics like VO2max, you’ll definitely need to put in some work at these intensities. On the other hand, if you’re just trying to get some movement in your life and you don’t care about getting better at it, lower intensity exercise like walking may be enough. According to major health organizations (including the CDC, the WHO, and the AHA), we should all be getting at least 150 minutes per week of “moderate” exercise, or 75 minutes of “vigorous” exercise. You can mix and match, with the idea that each minute of vigorous exercise counts double. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo where does walking fall in that recommendation? Walking is moderate, and I have more here on how that's defined. But if you want a rule of thumb to compare it to heart rate, the American Heart Association defines moderate exercise as that in which your heart rate is between 50-70% of your max, and vigorous exercise as between 70-85% of your max. (That does assume you know your true max.) Walking will generally be in the moderate range, so you’ll have to do twice as much of it—counting in minutes—as if you chose to do more vigorous cardio. That matches up with our calorie calculations.Walking doesn’t have to mean an easy strollThe distinction between walking and running is a mechanical one: if you always have at least one foot on the ground, you’re walking. If instead your gait has a little hop as you move from foot to foot, you’re running. (Jogging is simply a slow run.) It’s often easier to keep up a higher intensity (and a higher heart rate) by running than by walking, but that’s not always true. If you’re hiking up a mountain, your heart rate can easily get into the “vigorous” zone. And if you’re an efficient enough runner, you may be able to go for a slow jog while you keep your heart rate down in the “moderate” realm. As you’re planning your workouts, think about the intensity: Measure your heart rate if you aren’t sure where you fall; you can use a tracker like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch to do this, but you can also just put two fingers on the side of your neck and count the beats of your pulse. If your max is 200 and you count 150 beats per minute, you’re at 75% of your max heart rate. Maybe walking gets you a higher heart rate than you thought—not impossible if you’re a beginner or if your walks take you over hilly terrain. If you want a tougher cardio workout, you can walk faster, or you can choose a different type of exercise like cycling or dancing that gets your heart rate up higher. But it’s fine to go for an easy walk if that’s all you’re aiming for. \n            ",

However, one brand offers a complete surround sound system that is still on-par with the rest as far as quality, but offers a much better bang for your buck—that's Samsung's HW-Q990F/ZC, and right now it's 58% off on Woot for a new system. You can get it for $847.99 (originally $1,997.99), the lowest price I've seen it on sale.\nThe Q990F is a 2025 upgrade on the Q990D, which Samsung released in 2023. It's not much different except for a few tweaks that were the biggest cons on reviews. The Q990F added HDMI 2.1 with support for 4K at 120 Hz passthrough and VRR, which is ideal for serious gamers who want the lowest input lag possible. Samsung also added Wireless Dolby Atmos with compatible Samsung TVs, meaning you can have uncompressed Atmos audio without needing to hook up the HDMI cable to the eARC, sending it over wifi instead. The subwoofer was also improved with a tighter, more controlled sound. And of course, the overall tuning and audio technology are also better overall.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Q990F comes with a soundbar, subwoofer, and two rear speakers, and it's honestly the best surround sound system at this price that you can get. As you can read in PCMag's \"outstanding\" review, the system is powerful, elegant, and has impressive surround-sound audio. There is also a useful companion app that brings all of the settings and any tweaks that you can think of needing right on your phone. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:Remove AI from results\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.Return Google search to 10 blue linksGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search. \nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.Search a particular domainIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.Restrict results to one websiteIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.Look for specific file formatsWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.Google has easily accessible filters If you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse Google's Advanced Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.Try reverse image searchGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.Use content blockers to hide unwanted resultsIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.Set your favorite websites as preferred sourcesIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites. If you'd like, you can click this link to add Lifehacker as a preferred source.\n            ",

It's a powerhouse of a browser that is more widely used than any other.In the 18 years since its release, Chrome has changed a lot: A host of features have been added and taken away down the years, and it's very possible that you don't know everything that Chrome can do, even if you use it every day. Here are my favorite hacks for Chrome, covering everything from casting tabs to playing audio and video.Change the look and feel of Google ChromeIf you've always stuck with the 'out of the box' Chrome aesthetic, you might not be aware that it's relatively simple to change up the theme of the browser—which covers the colors of menus and tabs, as well as what you see on the new tab page. To see the available options, open up a new tab, then click the Customize Chrome button (lower right).You can apply any of the color themes just by clicking on them, or set up your own colors by clicking the color picker (the little pipette icon). For a more significant visual overhaul, click Change theme: You'll then see a range of options created and curated by Google. Click Chrome Web Store to see more official and third-party themes you can install.Claw back some RAM from Chrome\n    \n            \n            Activate Memory Saver for smoother performance.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's fair to say Chrome doesn't have the best reputation for efficient RAM usage, but you can get some of it back. In any tab, click the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Performance, and activate the Memory Saver option. As Google explains, this will put tabs you've not used in a while in an inactive state, and recover some RAM from them.Put your tabs up on a big screenIt's not a Chrome feature that gets much attention, but you can cast tabs wireless to a big screen via Google TV or Chromecast devices. It's useful for everything from music streaming to slide presentations, though the latency is usually too high for video playback (and bear in mind that YouTube, for example, has its own casting button for this).With a tab open in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then choose Cast, save and share > Cast. You'll then be asked to choose the device to cast to (which must be on the same wifi network of course). Via the Sources button, you can choose to cast just the tab you're in, or your entire Windows or macOS desktop, including Google Chrome.Switch up your search engine\n    \n            \n            Chrome can use whatever search engine you tell it to.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJust because you use Google Chrome doesn't mean you have to use Google Search—maybe you want to switch to a privacy-first alternative, like DuckDuckGo. To set up search engines in Chrome and change the default one, click the three dots in the top right corner of any tab, then choose Settings, and open the Search engine page.Use the Add button to add new search engines, the pencil icons on the right to edit their details, and the three dots on the right to set which one is used by default (when you type some search terms into the Chrome address bar). Each search engine can also have a shortcut: Type the shortcut into the address bar to run a search using that specific site.Group your tabs togetherTab grouping can make it much easier to manage the myriad tabs you've got open in every single session—these groups can be moved and closed and saved all together, so you could set up different groups for different research projects, for example, or for different tasks in the browser (maybe one for work-related browsing and another for shopping).The easiest way to get started with tab groups in Chrome is to right click on a tab header and pick Add tab to new group from the pop-up menu. Give your tab a name and color, and if you then right-click on other tab headers, you'll be able to add them to the group (or create a new one). Right-click on the headers of grouped tabs to access further options.Switch between user profiles\n    \n            \n            Add a new profile to separate your browsing activities.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nUser profiles are a hugely powerful Chrome capability that more people should know about: It lets you split your browsing into work and personal categories, for example, (and separate Google accounts, if needed). It means that logins, browsing history, and all the other data that gets stored in Chrome don't all get lumped together in one place.So, you could use your work profile for the day, and then switch to your personal profile at night—making it easier to access your Netflix login and Amazon shopping history, for example. To get started with profiles, click your current profile avatar (in the top right corner, next to the three dots), then choose Add Chrome profile from the menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEdit webpages with TampermonkeyIf you're prepared to invest some time and effort into your Chrome hacking, give the Tampermonkey extension a look (it's actually available for several browsers, not just Chrome). The tool lets you inject your own custom code to modify the websites you're looking at, so you can alter the appearance or even the functionality of pages.You could remove distractions from a page, for example, add your own keyboard shortcuts for navigation, or insert new buttons for sharing links on social media. We don't have the space for a full tutorial here, but if you head to the Tampermonkey website you'll find a wealth of help to get you started, plus some links to user script repositories on the web.Install web apps in Windows or macOS\n    \n            \n            Spotify's web app as a desktop app.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are plenty of powerful web apps you can get at through Chrome—Slack, Gmail, Spotify—and Google's browser lets you set these up as if they were desktop apps in Windows or macOS. You can get a shortcut straight to the app on the Windows taskbar or macOS dock, and when you launch it, it appears in its own distinct desktop window.With the web app open in Chrome, click the three dots (top right), then choose Cast, save and share > Install page as app. You'll then be asked to give your new app a name, and click Install to confirm. The app launches right away, and you can then organize it into your Windows or macOS system as you want (by pinning it to the taskbar, for example).Run a check for safety and privacyChrome comes with a built-in Safety Check that runs an audit on passwords, security updates, third-party extensions, and more. You can find the Safety Check screen by clicking the three dots to the top right of any tab, then choosing Settings > Privacy and security: As well as running the check, you can follow the recommended actions.\n    \n            \n            Chrome can quickly open files like PDFs.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGoogle Chrome can handle more than webpages: It's also able to open up PDF documents, and image, video, and audio files saved in common formats (like MP3 or MOV). Just drag a file into an empty tab to open it, or associate the file type with Chrome in Windows or macOS (which means it'll automatically open in the browser when you double-click on it).Chrome isn't the most advanced PDF editor or video player you're ever going to see, but it's a quick and easy way of opening up local files without having to launch an entirely separate program each time. You could use this alongside the Split View feature, for example, to watch a video stored on your system while making notes in Google Docs.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

When it comes to phishing schemes, which typically try to trick you into handing over sensitive data or account credentials via malicious links, tech brands are (perhaps not surprisingly) among the most commonly spoofed.  A recent report from Check Point Research found that Microsoft was imitated in nearly a quarter of all branded phishing attempts in Q4 of last year—nearly double the next most-impersonated company. The most popular brands for phishing scamsAccording to researchers, tech companies and social networks are consistently among the most popular brands for impersonators running phishing scams, with the following share in the final quarter of last year: \nMicrosoft: 22%Google: 13%Amazon: 9%Apple: 8%Facebook (Meta): 3%PayPal: 2%Adobe: 2%Booking: 2%DHL: 1%LinkedIn: 1%While you should always be on guard for common phishing tactics, it's wise to be especially wary of unsolicited communication from any of the companies listed—especially if that communication is related to account security and/or urges you to click a link. We've covered at least one campaign involving nearly every brand here, all of which are known and largely trusted among users, making them prime targets for these types of scams. Check Point notes that stolen Microsoft and Google credentials are particularly valuable because they're widely used in day-to-day workflows. Common phishing tacticsBroadly speaking, a phishing scam starts with an email, text, or social media message that appears to be from a legitimate source. It likely asks you to update or verify personal information—often related to a payment or account security—with a link to what appears to be the company's website or login page. Of course, this link leads instead to a spoofed version of that site designed to harvest your credentials, credit card number, bank details, or other personal data, which scammers can then use for identity theft, account takeover, or purchase fraud. Note that while the above methods are among the most common, phishing can also happen via phone call, voicemail, and malicious browser pop-ups. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect against branded phishing attacksAs we mentioned, just because you generally trust a company doesn't mean you should blindly trust all communication from it. If you receive a message that is unprompted, sounds urgent, and is unrelated to any recent action on your part (such as a login attempt or bill payment), do not engage with it. Don't click any links, open any attachments, or respond directly. Look out for typos and other errors, including the original sender—though as scammers have found ways to appear verified, this isn't always an obvious red flag. If you're unsure about the contents of the message, go directly to the website or app and log in to see any legitimate alerts. A password manager offers an extra layer of security here, as it'll protect you from entering credentials on a spoofed page. Finally, enable a strong, phishing-resistant form of multi-factor authentication everywhere you can, and especially for high-use and high-value accounts like Microsoft and Google. If your credentials are compromised, threat actors won't have that additional factor to utilize them. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

However, those with access to sensitive data that are valuable to threat actors may benefit.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts. For most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)As noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality. \nHow WhatsApp's Strict Account Settings protects high-risk usersStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on.

According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to subscribe to Full Self-Driving instead.Before, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).Now, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.Which features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.At any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

TV shows and movies follow story beats, meaning you can usually get a sense for where things are heading, but sports do not work that way. The totally unexpected can, and does, frequently occur—and that's the reason people keep tuning in, whether their team is dominating or an underdog.Sometimes, though, you can't catch the game live, but still want a bit of that feeling. That's why leagues offer extended highlights, featuring all the key moments, complete with the commentary from the broadcast. These can feel almost like watching the full game, and I love catching up with them the next day alongside my morning coffee. The problem: you'll typically find those videos on sites full of spoilers about who won, whether that's via a scoreboard at the top of the site or headlines blaring the results. If you're hoping for even a fraction of the fun of watching sports live, that's a problem.Don't Tell Me The Score is your solution. This simple website offers highlights for NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA games, with no scores or spoilers of any kind. The site interface shows only a bunch of icons representing all upcoming and recent games. Color logos means there are highlights are already available, and you can click or tap to start watching.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThis is my favorite way to catch up on games I missed. The videos, which are sourced from the league's official YouTube channels, tend to be a little over 10 minutes, meaning you'll see the highs and lows, but it won't take up hours of your day, and you won't know who won going in (provided you've also taken care to avoid spoilers via the TV, newspapers, social media, push notifications, or ill-timed texts from friends).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis tends to work really well, with one big hiccup: NFL videos can't be watched on the site itself, as the NFL prevents their highlights from being embedded on other sites. This means you'll need to click a link to watch the highlights on YouTube's website. This is a little annoying, but the YouTube pages usually don't include spoilers either, as long as you steer clear of the comments.I wish more leagues were supported—soccer highlights aren't offered at all, for example, and neither are the increasingly popular women's leagues. But if you're a fan of one of the \"big four\" North American sports, like watching highlights, and don't want to get spoiled first, Don't Tell Me The Score is worth adding to your daily rotation.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Right now, there is zero friction involved in opening Instagram or TikTok, and getting sucked into their algorithms. But add a paywall to those apps, and all of a sudden, I don't have any interest in logging on. If that sounds like it'd work on you too, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that Meta will soon test a subscription model for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The bad news is that these subscriptions won't be required to actually access the app, or the core features you already know. That will remain free, so we will remain hopelessly addicted. The details are light at the moment, especially concerning WhatsApp and Facebook. Meta told TechCrunch that the subscriptions will offer \"exclusive features\" on its apps, and will \"unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\" That will include more controls over how you share and connect with other users. Again, pretty vague. \nPerhaps part of this cloak-and-dagger approach is that Meta isn't really sure how it wants to roll out these subscriptions. The company explained to TechCrunch that it was testing a \"variety of subscription features and bundles,\" and that each app's subscription will feel unique from the others. While Meta isn't revealing much at this point, we might have a glimpse at what the company has in store for Instagram. Reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi posted on X that Instagram's paid subscription will include the option to create as many audience lists as you want, view a list of people you follow who don't follow you back, and—perhaps more enticing to some—look at another user's story without them knowing you saw it. Would you pay a monthly subscription to be able to lurk in other people's Instagram stories? (It's possible to do this already, by the way.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's another feature set that Meta plans to test subscriptions for that likely includes all three of these apps: AI features. Meta will experiment with subs for Vibes, the company's short-form AI video app built into Meta AI. The services has been free since it launched last fall, and will likely continue to be free, but Meta may charge for \"additional video creation opportunities.\" As much as I'm reluctant to say so, this really is Meta doing subscriptions right. I wouldn't pay for any of these features, but it's not like the company is taking away previously free features and locking them behind a subscription. If companies like Meta want to integrate a subscription model, they need to offer new features and abilities to justify the price. I might not think these anticipated features are worth it, but at least the current apps as they exist will remain free—even if charging for them would get me to stop using them for good. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Clawdbot is designed to be an agentic personal assistant. In layman's terms, that means the bot can perform tasks on your behalf: You give it full access to your computer, and it can organize your inbox, code for you, or clear your calendar (allegedly, anyway). You can also talk to it from a chat app of your choice, like WhatsApp or iMessage, rather than it's own interface. Some people are even buying Mac minis exclusively to run Clawdbot from. If you're wondering where that name came from, it takes after another AI company's product. Creator Peter Steinberger says he was inspired by the monster that appears when users reload Claude Code—Claude being one of the big AI products in the space right now, developed by the company Anthropic. Steinberger decided to go the lobster route with his logo, and named his own lobster mascot \"Clawd.\" From this, Clawdbot was born. The problem: Anthropic also calls Claude Code mascot \"Clawd.\" Whoops.By Tuesday, Clawdbot was no more (in name, anyway). It turns out companies like Anthropic don't appreciate it when you start your own business and use the name of their mascot as your own—especially when you're working in the same ridiculously lucrative field. Maybe if Clawdbot had never taken off, Anthropic wouldn't have noticed, but the bot became an internet sensation, which no doubt landed it on Anthropic's  radar. As such, Clawdbot has officially changed its name to \"Moltbot,\" suggesting a lobster molting from its shell. Clawd is now affectionally known as \"Molty.\" The company made the announcement on its official X page, noting that Anthropic had asked it to change the name over \"trademark stuff.\" (Steinberger struck a different tone on his personal X account, however, writing: \"I was forced to rename the account by Anthropic. Wasn't my decision.\")\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAside from the name change, the bot appears to be the same as it was on Monday. That is to say, it's still open source, still available to run locally on your own device, and still comes with the same inherent security risks I outlined yesterday. I still wouldn't recommend you install a program like Moltbot on your personal device, since, name change or not, you'd still be giving it incredible access to your hardware and its data with little knowledge of the safeguards in place to protect it. All it could take is one malicious prompt injection for Moltbot to molt your security.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

You download the apps you want to use, log into your accounts, and presto: You can stream anything with a few clicks of your remote. But smart TV apps aren't the only way people watch shows and movies on platforms like Netflix. Among other methods, like plugging a laptop directly into the TV, many people still enjoying casting their content from small screens to big screens. For years, this has been a reliable way to switch from watching Netflix on your smartphone or tablet to watching on your TV—you just tap the cast button, select your TV, and in a few moments, your content is beamed to the proper place. Your device becomes its own remote, with search built right-in, and it avoids the need to sign into Netflix on TVs outside your home, such as when staying in hotels. At least it did, but Netflix no longer wants to let you do it.\nNetflix no longer supports casting on most devicesWhile you can still cast to your TV from other streaming platforms, there's bad news for Netflix fans: The company has abruptly dropped casting support for most devices. Android Authority was the first to report on the change, though you might have stumbled upon the development yourself when looking for the cast button in the Netflix app. In fact, Netflix has prepared for your confusion, as you can see from this Netflix Help Center page titled \"Can't find 'Cast' button in Netflix app.\" This page might offer a glimmer of hope at first, as you think \"Oh good, Netflix has a solution if the Cast button is missing.\" Unfortunately, the response isn't going to make you happy: \"Netflix no longer supports casting shows from a mobile device to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. You’ll need to use the remote that came with your TV or TV-streaming device to navigate Netflix.\"The exception here is for \"older\" Chromecast devices or TVs that work with Google Cast—but only if you pay for an ad-free Netflix plan. If you took Netflix up on its lower-cost subscription offer, those ads not only cost you extra watch time, but also your ability to cast—assuming you even have the older hardware to cast to. While Android Authority was the first major publication to report on the issue, some Netflix casters have been living with the change over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 14, this user posted on the Chromecast subreddit voicing their complaints about the change. They were particularly frustrated with the lack of communication from Netflix, as the Cast button was removed \"with zero warning.\" Other users in the thread noted their frustrations, too, with some threatening to cancel their subscriptions over the issue.  Why is Netflix removing support for casting?Netflix doesn't explain why it's making the change, so I can only speculate. First, it's totally possible this is simply a tech obsolescence issue. Many companies drop support for older or underused technologies, and perhaps Netflix sees now as the time to largely drop support for casting. Streamlining the tech the app has to support means less work for Netflix developers, and it wouldn't be the first time the company dropped support for older platforms. However, that doesn't really explain why the company still supports some devices for casting. Maybe it took a look at its user base, and made the calculation that enough subscribers relied on Google Cast devices for casting, but not enough relies on newer hardware for casting. We might not really know unless Netflix decides to issue a statement.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, I can't help but feel like this is related to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing. The company clearly doesn't want you using its services unless you have your own paid account—or have another user pay extra to have you on their account. Casting, however, makes it easy to continue using someone else's account without paying for it. Since Netflix only requires mobile users to log into the account owner's home wifi once a month to continue watching on a device, you could theoretically cast Netflix from your smartphone to your TV to continue enjoying your shows and movies \"for free.\" By removing casting as an option for most users, those users will either need to connect a device to the TV by wire—like a laptop connected via HDMI—or log into the smart TV app. And if those users don't actually have permission to access that account via that app, they won't be able to stream. If this really is the company's intention, it's doing so at the inconvenience of paying users, too. If you're traveling, you now need to bother with signing into your account on a TV you don't own. If you don't like using your smart TV apps, you're kind of out of luck, unless you want to deal with connecting a computer to your TV whenever you want to catch up on Stranger Things. How to fix Netflix casting issues with compatible hardware If you do meet the new requirements for casting on Netflix, and the cast button still isn't appearing, Netflix does have some troubleshooting steps you can take on its Help Center page. It's device-dependent, but generally, here's what you should do:Check your Chromecast's wifi network: You can ensure your Chromecast is actively connected to your wifi network from the Google Home app on your iPhone or Android device. Turn your device off and on again: If you're casting from your phone or tablet, power it off completely, then turn it back on again. Turn your Chromecast off and on again: If your device boots back up but the Cast button is still missing, power off and unplug your Chromecast for at least 15 seconds before turning it back on again. Sign out of Netflix: Log out of Netflix on the device you're trying to cast from. Turn off Chrome extensions: If you're using Chrome on a Mac or PC for casting, Netflix recommends turning off your browser extensions. (This seems like an extreme step in my opinion, especially if you're someone who relies on Chrome extension—but if it works, it works.)    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        More than 45 million people in the United States rent their homes, and as purchasing a home continues to be out of reach for many, that number probably isn’t going down anytime soon. If you’re a renter, you know that renting often comes with some compromises in terms of control over your environment, space, and interior design. Being limited in what you can do because you don’t actually own the walls and floors can be a real challenge when it comes to making the space nice.But with a few clever ideas, you can make your rental more comfortable, more useful, and less expensive—and ensure that you get all of your security deposit back when you move out. There are a lot of useful hacks out there for renters, but these are the fundamental, most useful hacks that you might not think of, but every renter should know.Upgrade the little thingsRenters—especially first-time renters—often assume that they can’t change anything in a rented place. This is absolutely not true—while you might not want to actually spend money on an actual renovation to a place you don’t own (although some people do just that), there are actually a lot of things you can temporarily upgrade to make your basic box of an apartment feel more luxurious.\nBasically, if you can remove it, you can swap it. Light fixtures, cabinet and drawer pulls, bathroom mirrors, shower heads, faucets, toilet seats, and wall plates can all be easily removed and replaced with better, more stylish options. You put the old stuff in storage until you move out, and then you just swap everything back—and take your nicer stuff with you to the next place.Peel-and-stick surfacesPainting is powerful, and it’s not uncommon for a landlord to allow you to paint your apartment or rental house, helping you to inject some color and personalization into the place. But paint can’t repair janky walls, and painting a whole apartment (or even one room) can be a messy prospect. And sometimes you want to jazz up a space with tile—like kitchen backsplashes.Peel-and-stick options like temporary, removable wallpaper or wall tiles is a prime hack. It covers any defects in the walls, offers an enormous range of styles and designs, and peels right off without leaving a mark when you move out. In some cases, you can even re-use the tile or wallpaper at your next home, if you’re really careful removing and storing it.Folding furniture in small spacesIf you’re renting a tiny space, like a studio apartment, making it feel larger and making it more functional can be a challenge, especially since you can’t just hire a contractor and renovate the heck out of it. If you’re puzzling out how to make a small space multifunctional and less cluttered, the answer is probably folding furniture.Wall desks that fold down, folding dining tables, folding chairs, freestanding Murphy beds—just about any furniture that you use can be found in folding format, allowing you to transform a space into several different rooms with just a few quick moves.Stove and sink covers for extra prep spaceApartments often come with small kitchens and bathrooms, which can make cooking and washing up an exercise in frustration. An easy hack is to pick up some stove and sink covers for both the kitchen and bathroom. These handy items are cheap and provide extra prep space when you need it, then lift away to let you use your stove and sinks for their intended purpose. They can make small bathrooms and kitchens a lot more functional.Install temporary flooringRentals often have floors that tell a fascinating story of abuse, damage, and poor design choices. From painted floors to carpets you’d prefer not to touch with your bare skin, nothing makes an apartment feel like a punishment than a terrible floor—and no amount of good taste on the walls or in your furniture choices will erase that awful floor.So, cover it. You may not be able to sand and stain an abused hardwood floor, or tear up a carpet that was last cleaned in the previous decade, but you can very effectively cover it with a temporary floor that will pop right off when it’s time to move. This hack not only beautifies the space while you’re living there, it also guarantees that you don’t add to the damage and get nicked for stains, tears, or gouges.This can be as simple as putting a rug over a gross carpet or putting peel-and-stick tile (or a vinyl rug) on a kitchen or bathroom floor. Deck tiles can upgrade a gouged and stained floor into an attractive and temporary surface. If you just want to cover an ugly floor and give your space a more modern, updated look, vinyl rolls are a cheap and easy option to install—and remove.Erase-A-Hole for covering wall damageDrywall is amazing stuff, but it’s not exactly strong. It’s very easy to dent, ding, and otherwise damage your walls just by living near them. And every dent and ding could cost you when it’s time to move out; while a strategically-placed piece of art might hide that hole in the wall, it’s eventually going to be a problem.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLuckily, there’s Erase-A-Hole. With this stuff, you don’t have to spend six hours on YouTube learning how to mud and sand drywall repairs. You just rub the stick on the wall, let it dry, and then touch up the paint if necessary. If you love hanging things on your walls, this is going to save you hours of sweaty work when you move out.Get a stair-climbing cartIf your apartment is several flights up in a building without elevators, groceries soon become the biggest challenge in your life. Carrying heavy grocery bags up those stairs is not only a chore, it’s also an invitation to disaster because you’re probably going to try to carry everything in one trip, leading to broken bags, broken eggs, and possibly injuries because you can’t see your own feet.The stair-climbing cart is the hack you need. You use it as a normal grocery cart in the store, but when it’s time to get all those goods up to your apartment, it makes pulling everything up the stairs easy, safe, and fast.Install lots of tension rodsTension rods aren’t just for shower curtains. Investing in a pack of simple tension rods can transform your rented home in a wide variety of ways:Use them to hang curtains without drilling into wallsPlace them inside kitchen cabinets to create extra vertical storage (and under the sink to hang all those cleaning bottles)They can also be placed vertically inside cabinets to organize baking sheets and other flatwareMaximize closet storage with closet trianglesCloset space is always a challenge in small rentals. That’s why every renter should know about these closet triangles. They can dramatically increase the storage capacity of any closet, allowing you to hang several shirts or pants in the same space without making any changes to the closet itself. They work with any type of hanger, and you’ll be able to use the extra space in your closet for any other storage needs you might have.Take a video diary when you move inWhen you sign a rental contract, you’re taking on a legal responsibility for the condition of the apartment. When you move out, landlords are quick to pounce on any perceived damage that goes beyond “wear and tear” from normal living. After living there for years, are you going to remember if that stain on the floor was already there? And even if you remember, can you prove it?Before you move in, take a video of the place as you walk through. Focus in on anything that’s already stained, scuffed, damaged, or simply aged. Take your time and fully document the condition of the place. When you move out, you’ll be able to demonstrate that you left the place in the same condition you found it, and ensure you get your security deposit back.\n            ",

Normally $129.99, this home gym storage rack is currently on sale for $79.98. If you've been tripping over scattered dumbbells or wasting time hunting for the right weights mid-workout, this deal solves both problems for under $80.\nThis weight rack is specifically designed for a home gym. There are designated spaced for dumbbells, kettlebells, yoga blocks, resistance bands, medicine balls, and more—basically all the smaller equipment that tends to pile up in corners or get kicked under furniture. Having everything organized in one storage rack means you can actually find what you need when you need it.I recommend a dedicated storage rack like this so you can really focus on your fitness goals without the distraction of a cluttered space. In other words: No more digging through a heap of equipment or making multiple trips across your garage to grab different dumbbells between sets. Everything has its place, and you can grab what you need and get back to training.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Plus, they're compact and easy to wrap. Best of all, these Mate tags from Tile are —especially while they're 50% off for Cyber Monday. \nThey work like this: You affix them to whatever you like, and then you can either see where the item is on a map on your phone or play an alarm. But that's only half of what makes these trackers useful, because also work in reverse: You can click a Mate and it will ring your phone in case you lose that.  A four pack of Mate trackers for $39.99 is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered, so this isn't an illusionary bargain, and it's much cheaper than Apple's competing product: A four-pack of AirTags lists for $99, and is currently on sale for $62.99.

And here's the smart play: buying it now means you'll be ready to get ahead of the heat when spring training season rolls around.\nWhat the Core 2 doesThe Core 2 is a small plastic sensor that attaches to your heart rate monitor chest strap and tracks your body temperature during workouts. It's designed to help you understand how heat is affecting your performance, and guide you through heat-training protocols so you can adapt faster and more efficiently.My colleague Beth Skwarecki reviewed the Core 2 and found it a little fussy to set up, but easy to use and understand once you're up and running. What really impressed her was the big-picture view it provides: tracking how your body adapts to heat over time.Train hot, race coolThe data from the Core 2 serves two main purposes. First, it can guide your heat acclimation training—helping you adapt to hot conditions more strategically. Second, you can use it during races to monitor your core temperature and avoid overheating when it counts.As Beth points out, there's a legitimate debate about whether heat training makes sense for every athlete. You could argue that most runners would benefit more from longer or faster runs rather than adding heat stress to their training. But if you are training in the heat—whether because you live somewhere hot, you're preparing for a warm-weather race, or you're intentionally pursuing heat adaptation—the Core 2 seems to be an incredibly useful tool.Worth it for the right runnerAt nearly $300, this isn't an impulse purchase. But at $236, it's more accessible for serious athletes who want to take their heat training to the next level. Getting it now during Cyber Monday means you'll have months to familiarize yourself with the device before temperatures climb in spring and summer. By the time race season heats up, you'll already know exactly how your body responds to thermal stress—and how to manage it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech.

They may be a couple of years old at this point, but they're still competitive, and now there's a Cyber Monday 2025 deal that's bringing them to more than half off. That's a fantastic deal on a really good product, and if you're in the market for over-ear noise cancelling headphones, you should definitely consider it.\nIn Amazon's Cyber Monday 2025 sale, the Bose QuietComfort Headphones are down to $159.99 (54% off) in black. The best thing about these headphones are the color choices it's available in, and the good news is that multiple color variants are going at $179.99 (50% off). That's still a decent savings, even if it's not quite as high as what you'd save on the more boring color.PCMag's review gave this product a 4/5, praising it for its controls, sound quality, and noise cancellation. This product misses out on support for newer Bluetooth codecs, unlike the pricier Bose QuietComfort Ultra ($399, 11% off). The older product doesn't charge as fast as the QC Ultra either, but it will still sound great. The review calls out the price for being a bit too high, but this Cyber Monday Sale rectifies that. You can now get the QuietComfort headphones for $239 less than the QuietComfort Ultra. I recently tried the QuietComfort headphones in-person, and I was impressed by the build quality and how light they felt on my head. The noise cancellation was also great. These types of headphones serve a dual purpose in my life. They cut out external noise during long flights, and they also keep my ears warm when I'm in windy places in the winter (looking at you, Scotland!). If you're not sure which over-ear headphones to get this Cyber Monday, look no further than the Bose QuietComfort ones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday or Cyber MondayWhen you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ \"Black Friday\" or \"Cyber Monday\" tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it's the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, impulse buyers may not fully realize what they're buying.How to tell if a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.To avoid a low-key scam, do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I stumbled upon this older one by Epicka and bought it almost without thinking, something I rarely do. That turned out to be one of my best purchase decisions ever, because that travel adapter is still going strong. I've taken it to multiple countries and have used it extensively while traveling to remote locations in India, where you don't always have a reliable power supply. Last year, I gave it away to a friend I met during a meditation retreat, and she's been happily using it since then.This is the first time I've had a travel adapter for that long. I'd bought a few crappy ones before, and they couldn't always reliably charge multiple devices or last very long. This Epicka unit was quite impressive in that regard, but it did have a couple of limitations. It was a fairly slow charger, and it had only one USB-C port. I've been looking to upgrade to a better travel adapter for about a year now, and I think I'm going to do it this time. Epicka has another model with three USB-C ports and support for up to 75W charging, which makes it ideal for me. That one is now down to its lowest ever price in a Cyber Monday deal.\nEven at the deal price of $45 (15% off), it is a bit pricey, but I think the premium is worth paying for a fast charger from a brand with a good track record. I will say that this product is a bit bulky, and some people will prefer to travel with a more compact charging adapter, but its size never bothered me much. You also get two USB-A ports (one on each side) in this adapter, which is good for those with older charging cables.This Epicka universal travel adapter has a 4.8 rating on Amazon, with a total of 336 reviews at time of writing. The general consensus among Amazon reviewers is that this is a great product. One review says that if you charge multiple devices, this adapter splits power evenly across the devices, which means that all devices will be charged reasonably quickly. It has plugs for the US, UK, Australia, and EU, and a nice locking mechanism to keep the plugs in place.Note, though, that if you're planning to use high-wattage electronics such as hair dryers with this adapter, then it's not for you. This adapter is also not a voltage converter, so be sure to check if your electronics ship with a built-in converter when using the Epicka adapter in other countries. Most phone and laptop chargers are dual voltage, so you probably won't have to worry about it much, but safety first.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

It's the best non-Ultra smartwatch for your iPhone and, in my experience, its fitness-related features are excellent. This Cyber Monday deal brings the Series 11 down to $329 (18% off), which is an excellent price for a brand new Apple Watch.\nThe Series 11 is available in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm; and two variants: GPS, and GPS+Cellular. At time of writing, the best deal is on the 42mm GPS variant. All other variants are more lightly discounted, but be aware that your favorite color may not be discounted during this Cyber Monday 2025 sale.The key to finding great Apple deals is to buy from third-party retailers, and that's true for this Apple Watch Series 11 deal as well. Amazon's Cyber Monday 2025 sales have it cheapest right now.Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt said she loves the Apple Watch Series 11, but admittedly, she doesn't recommend it to those who already have a Series 10. If you have an Apple Watch that's a few years old, the Series 11 is worth buying, but it's hasn't taken a big enough leap ahead to justify annual upgrades.The Series 11 is thin, light, and plenty comfortable to wear all day. It has support for hypertension notifications, ECG recording, built-in GPS for tracking outdoor workouts, and an Ion-X display that's more scratch resistant than that of older Apple Watch models. It also has improved battery life compared to the Series 10.While it's common knowledge at this point, I still think it's worth mentioning that the Apple Watch only works with iPhones. You can't even pair it with an iPad or a Mac, so this device is only for iPhone users. If that sounds like you, this is a great opportunity for an upgrade.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Cyber Monday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

Both are $100 off. The sale began a few days ago for Black Friday, and is still available today on Cyber Monday. I've used and reviewed the Forerunner 570, and found it a step up from the earlier Forerunner 265 (which I also loved). The 570 adds a microphone and two different types of voice assistants, plus some new software features like heat acclimation and the ability to trim your activity if you didn't press \"stop\" when you crossed the race finish line. My only complaint is (or was) that the price seemed a bit steep in comparison to the previous model. But with the current deal, it's a lot closer to the original price of the 265: The 570 is now going for $449.99.\nThe Forerunner 970 is also $100 off, which brings its current price to $649.99. The biggest thing the 970 has going for it over the 570 is that it can show you maps while you run. Both watches can do breadcrumb tracking (drawing a line showing where you've been), but with a fully map-enabled watch, you can see important details like where your hiking route crosses roads or turns along them. The 970 also has an LED flashlight, which is incredibly handy for getting around in the dark—whether that means snuggling into your sleeping bag at a campsite or just sneaking out of your kid's room at bedtime.\nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

While you can find discounts on everything from fitness trackers to Kindles, subscriptions also offer sales, too. Case in point: Apple TV—not Apple TV+ anymore, mind you. Apple's own subscription service typically costs a relatively expensive $12.99 per month. But new and returning Apple TV customers can snag a six-month subscription to Apple TV for $5.99 per month. That amounts to more than a 50% discount on each month (53.89%, to be precise). You have some time to claim this price cut. This is a Black Friday and Cyber Monday deal, after all, so you'll be able to sign up now through Dec. 1 at 8 p.m. PT. Once you do, you'll be set for six months, but just make sure to keep an eye on the calendar: Once those six months are up, Apple will go back to charging you the full $12.99. You'll also need to subscribe through a method where Apple bills you directly. You won't be eligible for the discount if you sign up for Apple TV through a third-party provider. Finally, you won't be eligible if your account qualifies for a free trial.If you haven't been tuned in to Apple TV, now's a great time to check it out. The platform has surprisingly great catalogue, including popular shows like Severance, Ted Lasso, and Shrinking. Plus, there are a number of shows airing new episodes right now, like Pluribus, The Morning Show, and The Last Frontier. You can redeem the offer from any device that bills directly to Apple, or from Apple TV's official site.Does Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare its sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

Babbel makes it easier with practical, bite-sized lessons designed for real-life use, focusing on conversations you’d actually have—ordering food, chatting with the locals, asking for directions (read PCMag's in-depth review of Babbel to learn more)—and right now, its lifetime subscription is on sale for a huge discount: For Black Friday, a lifetime subscription to Babbel is on sale for $129 with promo code LEARN. The sale runs through Cyber Monday. It's a one-time payment—no recurring fees, no monthly charges—for lifetime access to all 14 languages (including French, German, Italian, and Spanish), making it cheaper than Babbel’s regular one-year plan at $300.Babbel’s lessons take just 10 to 15 minutes, so you can squeeze your practice into a commute or coffee break. And, unlike other language-learning apps that rely on repetitive vocabulary drills or random gamified exercises, Babbel follows a structured, linguist-designed curriculum that progressively increases in difficulty, so you don't plateau after the basics (earning itself a place in PCMag's \"The Best Language Learning Apps for 2025\" roundup). Plus, it’s not just passive learning—you get writing, speaking, and listening exercises with speech recognition technology to fine-tune your pronunciation, creating a far more immersive experience. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, dedication is still key, and no app will make you fluent, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, this Babbel Black Friday deal gives you a lifetime subscription with the tools to succeed without the burden of ongoing costs.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The sale runs through Cyber Monday. It's a lifetime of ad-blocking for less than what some services charge per month, but it's only available to new users, and you’ll need to redeem your code within 30 days of buying it.You can access and utilize this plan across nine devices, making it a solid pick for families or anyone juggling multiple gadgets. It works on Windows (7 and later), macOS (10.15 and later), iOS (12 and later), and Android (7 and later), covering most modern setups. AdGuard goes beyond standard ad-blocking by filtering out annoying pop-ups, stopping autoplay videos, and blocking phishing attempts. It also reduces trackers that follow you around the internet, which means less targeted advertising and a little more privacy. Unlike browser-based ad blockers, AdGuard operates at the network level, allowing it to block ads in apps and games as well. Setup is straightforward—you’ll receive your redemption code via email immediately after purchase, allowing you to start using it right away.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re already an AdGuard user, this deal won’t apply to you, but for new users looking for a one-time payment solution to dodge ads and boost privacy across multiple devices, this might be one of the best Black Friday deals out there right now.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The deal runs through Cyber Monday. The standout here is that you’re not just getting a license for Visual Studio, which is already a powerhouse development environment, but also lifetime access to more than 60 hours of beginner-to-advanced coding instruction.Visual Studio Pro 2022 itself is widely used in professional environments, built for serious dev work—think C#, Python, .NET, and more. You get tools like IntelliCode for AI-assisted coding suggestions, built-in Git support, debugging, and advanced testing features, all of which are useful whether you're building a small app or working on enterprise-level projects. Normally, licenses for just the IDE can get expensive, so getting it bundled with a full curriculum covering JavaScript, React, Python, CSS, and more is the kind of package that feels designed for someone starting out with ambition or a side hustle in mind.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this is a Microsoft-centric deal. If you’re aiming to become a Mac-based developer or work heavily with Xcode and iOS projects, this probably won’t be your best fit. The same goes if you’re already deep into development and just looking for a few advanced certifications, as some of the coursework may feel too foundational. But if you’ve been stuck in tutorial limbo, this bundle provides structure, software, and real-world tools at a reasonable price. For under $40, it’s hard to beat the value, especially for learners who want both a development platform and a guided roadmap in one place.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

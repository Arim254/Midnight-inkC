Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

But you can use it in almost any context, for anything you need to remember. Obviously, you're here because it's helpful when you're taking a test, but the ways you can apply it in that scenario are a little unique and you'll need to get the hang of something that seems silly at first. Here's what to do.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhat is the method of loci?If “loci” sounds like “location,”  that’s because it’s what this method is all about: Location, location, location. To employ the technique, you use visualizations of specific spatial environments to help you recall information. It’s been around for centuries and is still in use today, as memory contest participants say it helps them recall everything from faces to digits. (Did you know there are memory contests?)Think of a location you know well, ideally one with a lot of defining features. Maybe it’s a street with a bunch of different shops, a room with a variety of surfaces and corners, or your childhood home. Any singular place works, but it's crucial it's one you know well and can truly visualize in your mind's eye. When you have to remember a ton of things, like items in a list or topics to hit in a speech, imagine yourself placing them, one by one, in one of those little loci. One topic can go in the corner, another on the desk, and another in the windowsill, for instance. When you want to retrieve or recall the information, imagine yourself walking through the area again, picking up what you need to remember from its proper place.Why does this work? Generally speaking, your brain remembers images better than it remembers words or numbers, so attaching the words or digits you need to remember to an image makes them easier to retrieve.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to use use the method of loci in real lifeOne way to tap into the power of this memory trick is “placing” your memory items around the room you’ll be in when you need to recall them. If you know you have to speak in front of a meeting in a certain conference room, or take a test in a particular classroom, use that imagined setting as the spot where you drop your listed items.Better yet, prepare in that space. If you're able to, sit in the classroom where you'll take your test as you prepare, maybe staying late after class or entering it when it's unoccupied at some point during the week. Imagine yourself placing the things you're studying, one by one, in locations around the room. You can even wander around and pantomime doing so if that seems helpful. Just make sure the loci you pick are permanent. Don't assign a key fact to, say, a cup of pens on the professor's desk, which may be removed from the room before your test date. Choose things like the radiator, a discolored ceiling tile, the podium, or a doorstop. If you can't study in the classroom itself, this trick does require you to plan ahead and be familiar with the room by memory alone, so choose even broader loci, like the door or the window. And don't forget that this can all be a mental game. Your locations can be anywhere you can remember well, like the break room at your job or your bedroom, as long as you can pull up that mental map in your mind at test time.Why it worksThis might seem frivolous, but it does work. It's part of a broader memory technique called association. With association, you can make up mnemonic phrases, sing a little song, or, yes, use the method of loci. The goal is associate your newfound knowledge with something else, so whenever you think of that other thing—in this case, a location—you'll automatically remember the nugget of information you associated with it.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

All of that is fine and well—though generally, following a Stack or personalized plan is better, since it reduces the time you spend deliberating and dilly-dallying and gives you a clear goal for the workout—but you have another option. In fact, depending on your goals, you have another potentially superior option in the form of a Peloton Program.What is a Peloton Program?Program is the term Peloton uses for longer-term, guided training routines that are tailored to a specific goal. They can range from a few days long to weeks long, but the idea is that you'll finish the program and be more prepared to do whatever it was you were training for. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhen you log into the app on your mobile device or Peloton equipment, you'll see your personalized plan first, followed by a subheading that says Your Programs. There, any Programs you're currently participating in will be ready to go. You can just tap it to keep moving through it with whatever class or exercise is next up. To access Programs and see everything available, tap Classes in the bottom row of the mobile app, then Programs up at the top. (It's to the right of Classes, Gym, and Collections.)Each program is designed by an instructor (or, sometimes, more than one instructor) and when you tap on it, you'll see information on how many classes are in it, how many days or weeks it lasts, and how long the classes are. You'll also see a summary of the Program and what it's designed for, as well as notes on which equipment, if any, is necessary for the classes. You can even see a week-by-week breakdown of what classes to expect. These are self-paced, so you can take the classes or participate whenever you want, but you should try to do them in the timeframe laid out by the instructor. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat can you use Programs for?This is the fun part. There are so many Programs and some of them are almost too specific to believe—but that's why they're useful. There's probably one in there that aligns with exactly what you're trying to do, whatever it is. A selection of titles:Strength for Soccer (one week, seven classes)The Power of Sleep (two weeks, 15 classes)Strength for Cyclists (one week, six classes)Floor Bootcamp (four weeks, 24 classes)Road to Half Marathon (10 weeks, 40 classes)Strength for Tennis & Pickleball (one week, eight classes)Strength for Skiers (one week, 11 classes)You Can Run Outdoors (eight weeks, 16 classes)Set the Barre (four weeks, 13 classes)Path to Inversion (two weeks, 12 classes)There is \"density training,\" training for people who golf, and training for anyone looking to pull off a yoga inversion. Again, these are specific goals, but with strength, meditation, and other classes geared toward them, you can take a more well-rounded approach to meeting them. Programs are also classified as beginner, intermediate, or advanced, so you don't end up in over your head or bored. One thing I like about them—besides that they help you create a goal-based workout plan and are so tailored to specific achievements—is that participating in them earns you extra points toward your Club Peloton rank. By moving up in Club Peloton, you can unlock discounts and early access to other classes, providing even more variety (and some smugness, if you're like me). \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.There's much to say about Sora, which is essentially OpenAI's TikTok for AI slop. But putting my concerns aside for what appears to be a glorified deepfake machine, it's evident the app is popular. OpenAI says Sora hit one million downloads in under five days, likely fueled by interest from users seeing hyper-realistic videos going viral on social media. But with big hype, comes big risk for fraud. While OpenAI made Sora free to download, the app started out invite-only, which only built anticipation for users who wanted in. As such, those users might open the App Store, search for Sora, and download the first app that makes itself available—especially if they can start using it right away. That's exactly what happened in this case. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs reported by TechCrunch, over a dozen fake Sora apps were made available on the iOS App Store following the launch of OpenAI's real app. These apps were either called \"Sora\" or \"Sora 2,\" the latter in reference to the specific video model powering these hyper-realistic AI generations.You might assume developers hastily uploaded these apps to the App Store in an attempt to pull traffic from users curious about Sora. And while that is true, a number of these apps were already live on the App Store long before OpenAI ever announced the Sora app—some of which were operating under different names. It's not clear how many changed their names in this situation, but it's apparent that many did adjust their names shortly after Sora launched. TechCrunch says some apps had been available on the App Store since earlier this year, while others were available since last year.  Apple's App Store isn't the only affected app market here. Google's Play Store played host to fraudulent Sora apps, as well. Taken together, these apps were downloaded more than 300,000 times, with more than 80,000 of those occurring after Sora's official launch. Perhaps the most successful fake Sora app, \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator,\" pulled in over 50,000 downloads alone once OpenAI released Sora. TechCrunch reports that these apps collectively earned over $160,000, all from apps claiming to be something else entirely. At this time, most, but not all, of these apps have been pulled from app stores.How to spot fake apps on your app storeFirst of all, if the app you're trying to download is trendy and popular, like Sora, assume there will be developers trying to spoof it. Malicious developers want to trick users looking for one app into downloading theirs, whether it's to install malware on your device, steal your information, or make money off you by running ads. If they know a million people are going to be downloading an app, hosting a fraudulent one makes for good business.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen looking through the app store's results page, pay close attention to the name of the app. Sure, it might have \"Sora\" in the title, but does it have any odd, extraneous words added in? \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator\" isn't the worst fake name I've ever seen, but the app's name is Sora, not Sora 2. OpenAI also likely wouldn't add AI Video Generator to its own product's name: They probably know the product speaks for itself, and wouldn't feel the need to clutter up the name with extra details. Instead, the real title is \"Sora by OpenAI,\" likely done to both distinguish itself from legitimate apps named Sora, as well as indicate that it is indeed made by OpenAI.Speaking of which, you should always make sure the app in question is distributed by the company that made it. If you're trying to figure out which of the Sora apps on your app store is the real one, it's going to be the one that says it's made by OpenAI. I'm not talking about the title alone, either. Tap on the app, and look at the developer name underneath the title. If it doesn't match the exact company you know develops the app, don't download it.You'll also want to investigate the copy and images advertising the app here. Is everything written well, and free of spelling and grammar mistakes? Are the images high quality, and reflect the experience the app it advertising? Don't download something that feels slapped together: Some fraudsters don't bother with the finer details.  Finally, make sure the app in question is actually available on the platform you're using. Sora is currently iOS-only, which means any app claiming to be Sora by OpenAI on the Play Store is a fraud. If you're on Android, you'll simply need to wait for OpenAI to make the app for your platform. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

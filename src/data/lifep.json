It seems I can't open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube without running smack into bizarre and troubling AI concoctions featuring babies in danger and cats having affairs. It really is the wild west (or maybe Westworld) out there. I think few among us really believe these videos are any good, and it's pretty obvious they aren't good for us, or for the world. Short-form video is already numbing enough, but this AI content is generally completely devoid of any meaning or substance. And yet, it's everywhere. I haven't spent too much time on YouTube Shorts recently, but in my limited experience, the feed has been chock full of AI, especially if I'm logged out of my personal account.Still, if you're a dedicated YouTube Shorts user (or a frequent YouTube user in general) you might have noticed something odd in recent days: There don't seem to be quite as many AI videos on the platform right now. There are still a lot, don't get me wrong, but it turns out YouTube has recently taken action to remove some of its AI content—the sloppiest of the slop. \nYouTube's war on AI slopAndroid Police spotted the development on Wednesday, basing its findings on a November report from Kapwing, a company that develops an online video editor. Kapwing investigated AI slop across YouTube's vast content library, noting the top 100 most-subscribed YouTube channels that publish this sort of AI content. In the two months since that report, Android Police noticed that 16 of those 100 channels are no longer with us.That includes the most popular AI channel on YouTube, at least according to Kapwing. \"CuentosFacianantes\" had 5.95 million subscribers at the time of their initial report, and produced AI-generated shorts inspired by Dragon Ball. The channel had amassed roughly 1.28 billion views by the end of last year; despite launching in 2020, it had curated its library to begin Jan. 8, 2025, so those numbers were racked up pretty recently. The number two channel, \"Imperio de Jesus\" with 5.87 million subscribers, and the number seven channel \"Super Cat League,\" with 4.21 million subscribers, were also shut down. According to Android Police, the 16 channels in question had a total of 35 million subscribers and over 4.7 billion views across their collective videos. Some of these channels are completely gone, while others simply have had their videos removed. Why is YouTube removing AI slop?YouTube CEO Neal Mohan published a post on Jan. 21 of this year describing the company's vision for 2026. Towards the end of that letter, he acknowledges AI content, predicting that, \"AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" and comparing it to tools like Photoshop and CGI, adding \"AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.\" However, Mohan was also critical of the technology, noting that it's becoming more difficult to tell real videos from AI. He notes that YouTube is now removing \"any harmful synthetic media that violates our Community Guidelines,\" and is giving creators tools to help identify and block deepfakes. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore interestingly, the letter includes a section labeled \"Managing AI slop,\" which is the first time I've seen a company like YouTube use that expression. Mohan says that YouTube's goal is to be a place where free expression thrives, but also a place \"where people feel good spending their time.\" To that point, he says, \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.\"Mohan doesn't call out any accounts by name, nor does he acknowledge the accounts and content the company has already deleted, but it's a clear line in the sand: YouTube is not against AI-generated content, but it will remove low-quality AI content it feels is, well, slop. That's good news for anyone who uses YouTube (so, pretty much everyone), even if it's far from a cure for the growing problem.I've reached out to YouTube for comment on this story, and will update this piece if I hear back. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message. The healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text. Are you eligible for the Kaiser settlement? To qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to claim your settlement cashTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12. While the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can see how long each track is, who performed it, and maybe even the song writing credits, but you don't know why the artist wrote the song, or what each song is supposed to mean. You can, of course, scour the internet, looking at articles and blogs to learn more about your favorite music—or, you can skim Spotify's new summary cards that offer fun facts about each track. Spotify announced the new feature, called \"About the Song,\" on Friday. The feature, which is launching in beta, is available in the app's Now Playing View. When you select it, you'll see story cards you can swipe through that tell you more about the song you're listening to. Spotify says the stories are summarized from \"third-party sources,\" and in my testing, I've seen sources like Hypebeast, Wikipedia, and fan sites. The company also tells me that \"some systems\" of the feature use machine learning to generate these summaries, which means About the Song is, in part, AI-generated.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nAs with many of Spotify's new features, About the Song is only available for Premium subscribers. At this time, it's also limited to English accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. If you pay for Spotify in one of these regions, the feature is exceptionally easy to find. When you're listening to a song, just scroll down on the page until you see the \"About the Song\" card. If you don't see it, that song likely doesn't support the feature. Some songs will only have one summary card, but others may have more. If so, you'll see icons in the top right of the card window telling you which card you're reading. You can swipe left on the card to open the next. \nI've seen songs with as many as four of these cards, though it's possible some songs have even more. Some of those are all summarized from the same source—say, one Wikipedia article—while others pull from multiple sources to generate multiple About the Song cards. There are thumbs-up and thumbs-down options on each card to rate the summary, implying these are AI-generated. The summaries appear to be static once generated though—when I quit the app and return, the summaries are the same. I'd be curious to know if the summaries are the same for everyone who chooses a song, or if they're generated for each individual listener.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify has had a busy week. On Thursday, one day before announcing \"About the Song,\" the company revealed its plans to start selling physical paper books, which sync with its digital audiobooks. The day before that, Spotify revamped its lyrics feature, including the option to download lyrics for offline viewing. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This year's broadcast, hosted on NBC, includes pregame coverage starting at 1 p.m. ET and a pregame show featuring Green Day at 6 p.m. ET. Even if you don't have cable, there are a few ways, both paid and free, that you can watch all the action live from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. You can watch Super Bowl LX on PeacockThe game will be shown on NBC-owned streaming service Peacock, which is available on the web as well as iOS, Android, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. Peacock doesn't have a free trial, and you have to subscribe to the middle tier—Peacock Premium, which costs $11 per month—to get live sports. Or you can pay $17 per month for ad-free Premium Plus (live sports still have ads). There are a few ways to get around subscribing at full price. Peacock Premium is a perk of both a Walmart+ subscription ($98 per year after a 30-day free trial) and an Instacart+ subscription ($99 per year after a 14-day free trial), so if you have or would benefit from either of these services, now may be the time to sign up. Students qualify for a discounted rate of $6 per month for Peacock Premium. Note that Peacock will also have streaming and on-demand coverage of the Winter Olympics, which begin this weekend, so subscribing for a month may be well worth $11. \nSign up for a live TV streaming serviceThere are a handful of streaming services with live TV that include NBC. Before signing up, check the channel listings for your zip code to confirm NBC is available in your local market. DirectTV Stream: $50 per month for the first month with current promotions, 5-day free trialHulu + Live TV: $90 per month, 3-day free trial (includes ads on Hulu)YouTube TV: Currently $70 per month with promo, 21-day free trial for new usersSling TV (in limited markets): $46 per monthWhen signing up for a free trial, make sure you know when you'll be billed for a paid subscription and cancel before your trial expires. The game will be available in 4K for YouTube TV subscribers (included in the free trial but at an additional fee or at a higher tier with paid plans). The Spanish-language broadcast will be on Telemundo, which is also available on most live TV streaming services. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to watch Super Bowl LX over the airAnother free (ish) way to get the game is with over-the-air (OTA) TV. Of course, this requires you to invest in a digital TV antenna and have a place to put it that gets good reception. You should check the FCC's reception map to see what signals are available in your area and try your antenna out before game day. Your mileage may vary, so if you want a stress-free watch experience, this probably isn't the best option. Other ways to watch the Super BowlYou can also watch the game through the NFL+ mobile app—a subscription costs $7 per month. Fubo previously carried NBC channels but has been in a contract dispute with NBCUniversal since last 2025. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's not your internet connection, and it isn't your OpenAI account: ChatGPT is down. According to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, users started reporting issues with ChatGPT at 11:56 a.m. ET. Those reports ballooned by 12:11 p.m., as the total number of incidents as of this article currently sits above 7,000. If you're an avid ChatGPT user, you might have also had issues with the bot yesterday: Downdetector shows over 25,000 reports of down time starting at 2:56 p.m. Tuesday and resolving around 4:11 p.m. the same day. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with all outages, OpenAI will likely figure out a patch for the issue soon enough.

This so-called \"ghost student\" scam capitalizes on limited verification for online class sign-ups and the federal aid application process to steal millions in funds while assigning the debt to unsuspecting targets. I personally have been a victim of this scam, which I discovered only after an outstanding student loan debt landed on my credit report in 2024. Here's how the scheme works. 'Ghost student' scam relies on stolen identitiesTo run this scam, fraudsters use stolen or fake identities to enroll \"ghost students\" in online classes while also applying for federal student aid, including Pell grants and loans. Of course, they never actually attend those classes, instead disappearing with the money and placing the resulting financial burden on the individuals and schools they've conned. \nIn my case, scammers had used just enough accurate personal information to \"enroll\" at a community college in southern California and take out a Pell grant in my name. However, because the enrollment was fraudulent, the grant was considered overpaid and sent to collections via the U.S. Department of Education—which is how it landed on my credit record. According to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Inspector General (OIG), this type of fraud blew up with the shift to online and remote learning, particularly at community colleges that offer open enrollment (and generally engage in limited verification of applicant information). Increasingly, AI tools also likely help scammers to expand their reach with enrollment and loan applications and get past identity verification checks. The scheme has affected schools across the country. In California alone, nearly a third of all applicants to community colleges in 2024 were identified as fake. A handful of individuals have been sent to prison after stealing millions in \"ghost student\" financial aid, but the OIG still has 200 investigations open. For individuals targeted by the ghost student scam, the consequences are essentially the fallout of identity theft, such as debt falsely assigned to you that negatively affects your credit or the inability to get legitimate student loans (or any other type of credit) when you actually need them. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt also forces you into a long and arduous process of disputing the fraud: I spent several months going back and forth between the Department of Education, the community college, the credit bureaus, and an attorney to track down the fraudulent applications, file identity theft reports, provide extensive documentation proving that I wasn't responsible for the debt, and get the information removed from my record. How to protect your identity from student loan fraudUnfortunately, the ghost student scam circumvents a standard anti-fraud safeguard because most federal student aid doesn't require a credit check. (My credit record had been frozen for years, and still was at the time that this fraud took place.) While you should absolutely freeze your credit and thaw it temporarily only when needed, this step may not prevent bad actors from using your information to apply for grants and loans. Because this scam is a form of identity theft, you should take every precaution to safeguard your personal information. Given the ubiquity of data breaches and hacks, you can assume a lot of it is already out in the open, but that doesn't mean you can't lock accounts down and practice good digital hygiene. Credit fraud alerts and a regular review of your credit reports will help you catch any suspicious activity quickly. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That also undercuts its current $339.99 price on Amazon, and price trackers suggest this is the lowest it has ever been. Woot's deal runs for another three weeks or until stock sells out, so don't wait too long to make a decision here. Amazon Prime members get free standard shipping (while everyone else pays $6), though shipping is limited to the contiguous U.S. \nThis is Samsung’s most feature-heavy watch, and the LTE connectivity means you can leave your phone at home and still take calls, send texts, and stream music. That alone gives it a strong edge over wifi-only smartwatches, especially for runners, cyclists, or folks trying to spend less time glued to their phones.This model is part of Samsung’s latest Watch 8 lineup, which launched last summer, and it has already earned strong praise, including an “excellent” review from PCMag, which named it the best Android smartwatch of 2025. Its Super AMOLED display is bright enough to read outdoors, even in harsh sunlight, and the interface feels responsive thanks to Samsung’s Exynos W1000 processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health tracking goes well beyond steps, with support for a wide range of fitness and wellness tools, including heart rate, ECG, temperature, blood oxygen, and even antioxidant levels. Google Gemini also comes preloaded for smarter voice control. That said, this watch plays best with Samsung phones. You’ll need any Android 12+ phone to use it, but some of the more advanced features, like snoring detection, are locked to Samsung devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe trade-off, as with most Samsung watches, is battery life. Real-world usage lands around 26 hours, so daily charging is part of the routine. That won’t work for everyone. On the upside, durability is solid, with IP68 dust and water resistance, a 5ATM swim rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification for tougher conditions. If you’re all-in on Samsung and want a fully independent smartwatch, this deal makes a lot of sense, especially at this price. But, if you’re still weighing options, see how it stacks up against Google’s flagship wearable, the Pixel Watch 4, here.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But what if you actually used the right ctrl key? Or what if you prefer Claude or ChatGPT to Copilot? Whatever your reason for not loving the Copilot key, don't worry—you can change it. Here's how to do so in the Windows settings or, if necessary, using Microsoft Powertoys.How to change the Copilot key in settingsOpen the Settings application and head to the Personalization section. You should find a Customize Copilot key option here, assuming you're using a recent-ish version of Windows 11. Click the drop-down menu and you'll have three options: Copilot, Search, and Custom. You can change the button to Search if you'd rather use the key to bring up the Windows search tool instead of Copilot.Alternatively, you can use the Custom option to launch any application on your computer instead of Copilot. This could be a useful way to open the Claude or ChatGPT desktop apps instead of Copilot. Or, if you're not a big AI fan, you could just have it open your browser.\nThis is a limited number of options, granted, but it's easy and doesn't require any sort of tools. It's your simplest option.How to change the Copilot key using Microsoft PowertoysYou may have noticed that the options in Settings don't let you remap the Copilot key to the ctrl key, or any other key—all you can do is launch an application. For that, you're going to need to install Powertoys, the secret Microsoft app that improves Windows.After installing, go to the Keyboard Manager section. The simplest thing to do, which may or may not work on your computer, is to click Remap keys. You should be able to press your Copilot key to remap it (it will show up as F23, which we'll get to). Now you can choose what you want the key to serve as. This could be ctrl, if you like, or it could be any other key. Click OK, and you should be done.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThere's a chance this won't work for you. Why? Because the Copilot key works a little differently depending on what kind of laptop you have. Buckle up: This gets complicated in a very Microsoft-y way.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn many computers, the Copilot key functions as an F23 key. This is a workaround, of sorts, allowing Microsoft to add a key without changing the operating system very much. Most modern keyboards only have one row of function keys—around 12 in total. Keyboards in the 80's and 90's sometimes had two rows of keys—around 24 in total. Windows, to this day, still supports all 24 keys, even though basically no one has that many function keys. Microsoft took advantage of this—on many laptops the Copilot key functions as an F23 key.But this is Windows, so of course it's more complicated than that. On some laptops, pressing the Copilot key triggers a keyboard shortcut: Windows-Shift-F23. This means you can't use the Remap keys function in Powertoys to remap the Copilot key, because the Copilot key already triggers a keyboard shortcut.What you can do is use the Remap a shortcut option. Use this, then press the Copilot key as your selection. You should see the keyboard shortcut Windows-Shift-F23 show up. Now choose what you want to remap your Copilot key to.This works, with a caveat: You really can't use it to bring back your ctrl key, as users have noted on Github. The issue is that you can't remap a keyboard shortcut to a modifier key, just to a single keypress. It's not clear what could fix this, and I suspect users of such laptops are just stuck. Which is all to say that you might not be able to get your control key back, but least you can remap the key to do something else.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

According to Google, feedback on the feature suggested it \"didn't provide helpful next steps\"—so while it alerted users when their data was out in the wild, it wasn't clear what to do about it. Now, Google is shifting its focus from the dark web monitoring tool to features like its online Security Check-Up and passkey protection. In other words, instead of flagging when your account credentials appear in a data breach, Google wants to make sure that your accounts stay safe even if a breach has occurred.There are reasons why you should be keeping an eye on dark web chatter, however—and there are tools to take over the monitoring job now Google has backed out.What is the dark web—and why do I need to monitor it?\n    \n            \n            Keeper provides a free dark web scan.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEssentially, the dark web is made up of online spaces that you can't get to just by pointing your browser at a web address. You need specialist software and a little bit of technical know-how to find your way into the dark web and to navigate around it. It's largely hidden from the world at large via encryption and rerouting. Why all the secrecy? The dark web is used to evade both law enforcement and ruling powers, so it's the perfect place to carry out somewhat illicit activities as well as get around the machinations of oppressive surveillance states. It's a place where hackers and whistleblowers alike can gather.\nSpeaking of hackers, dumps of information from data breaches will often find their way on to the dark web, to be traded or given away for free. Whether it's your email address, phone number, social security number, or passwords, if this data has been exposed by a hack, you're much more likely to find it on the dark web than on Reddit.Dark web monitoring tools, like the one Google just shut down, are intended to give you a heads up if your details have appeared in a data dump. You can then do something about it, whether it's getting in touch with your bank to check for any signs of identity theft, or changing the password for your email service.Having a dedicated tool for the task saves you from having to trawl the dark web yourself—which isn't particularly easy or pleasant—and while Google might be closing down its monitoring service, you've got several alternatives you can turn to instead.The best dark web monitoring tools you can try\n    \n            \n            Proton's dark web scanner is part of the Proton Unlimited subscription.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nProton is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and the privacy-focused company also has a Dark Web Monitoring tool of its own. You do need a paid plan to access it though, from $12.99 a month or $119.88 a year, which includes multiple perks across all Proton's products. You can find it from the Security and privacy side panel in the Proton Mail app.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nProton uses a variety of intelligence datasets in its dark web sweep, and looks out for details including email addresses, usernames, dates of birth, physical addresses, and government IDs. The leaks will be categorized in terms of how urgently action needs to be taken, and Proton doesn't give your data to third parties.Trend Micro has a Data Leak Checker that covers the dark web, which you can use without paying anything or even signing up for an account—though you can only check for mentions of your email address or phone number in leaks. For more comprehensive scans and alerts, you can sign up for a premium account, from $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year—and there's lots more included besides dark web monitoring.Keeper Security takes the same approach with BreachWatch: You can run a quick scan for breaches including your email address without paying or signing up, but if you want anything more advanced (including proactive notifications) then you need to sign up for $24.99 a year. The feature can be added to any of Keeper's other paid-for plans too.If you currently pay for a security product, such as a password manager or a VPN, you may well find that dark web monitoring is included—so check through your existing subscriptions. For example, the Surfshark Alert dark web monitoring tool comes as part of the Surfshark One VPN bundle, with pricing from $17.95 a month or $40.68 a year.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

What if you could get cable for a single day, then ditch it? That's the basic idea behind Sling's 1 Day Pass. For $5, you can get  a day's access to ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, and a few more channels besides. That array will cover quite a few nationally broadcast sporting events.Unfortunately, like most everything related to watching live television in the age of streaming, this is more complicated than I'd like. A 1 Day Pass is only available for Sling Orange, which includes just a subset of Sling's overall offers. On top of that, Sling has always been a little bit confusing—an attribute it shares with the legacy cable companies still standing. But if you need one of the channels offered on Sling Orange, it's theoretically a good deal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sling\n                    \n    \nGiven it's February, and you might be wondering whether you can use a 1 Day Pass to watch the Super Bowl without cable. Sadly, the answer is no: The big game is on NBC this year, and while Sling does offer NBC in a few markets, local channels aren't covered by Sling Orange The same goes for the winter Olympics, which will air on NBC and USA; you'll have to make a different plan to watch the Winter Games.\nBut March Madness is coming up too, and quite a few of those games are going to be available via a 1 Day Pass, so keep this service in mind if there's a single sporting event you want to watch, especially if you notice it's on ESPN, TBS, or TNT.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, could one argue that it's easier to install an ad blocker and search the internet for a pirated stream than it is to figure out how to legally watch something? Yes. Yes one could. But a Sling 1 Day Pass can save you from that temptation (not to mention accidentally downloading malware) for just $5.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It has a longer battery life and tiny tweaks that make a big difference, like a brighter screen, greater durability, and new software features. Right now, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm) is down 25% to $299 (originally $399), marking its lowest price ever on Amazon. \nIn PCMag's real-world testing, the watch delivered nearly two days of battery life and features a brighter screen with 2,000 nits of peak brightness. It’s also more rugged than its predecessor, with a harder, scratch-proof screen, a waterproof build (paired with a water temperature sensor and depth gauge up to 6 meters), and a dust-proof IP6X rating. It features Apple’s newest and smartest software, watchOS 26, which includes features such as Sleep Score metrics and enhanced safety alerts like life-saving hypertension notifications.Unlike the Apple Watch SE 3, for just $50 more at the current discount, the Series 11 has a thinner design with a larger display, and sensors that detect blood oxygen levels and ECGs, as well as other heart health and temperature sensors. The 11 also packs in an altimeter, gyroscope, compass, and ambient light sensor. Users can dive into their workout data via the iOS Fitness app, while the iOS Health app houses biometrics and ECG results. This model includes GPS, enabling real-time tracking of distance and pace during outdoor workouts. It also supports 5G connectivity, ensuring a stronger connection wherever you are.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re an iPhone user looking to upgrade your smartwatch or invest in a feature-rich one that’s ultra-durable, longer-lasting, and has 5G connectivity, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm), powered by watchOS 26, offers solid bang for your buck at its lowest-ever price of $299.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Users are urged to claim their rewards ASAP by clicking the included link, which is actually designed to harvest sensitive personal information. AT&T rewards scam phishes personal informationTargets for this scam have received texts containing a \"Rewards Expiration Notice\" urging them to redeem points in their AT&T account before they are scheduled to expire. The message includes a specific points balance and expiration date along with two \"recommended redemption methods\": AT&T Rewards Center: [shorturl link]AT&T Mobile App: Rewards sectionAs Malwarebytes discovered, the short link sends users to a https://att.hgfxp[.]cc/pay/, a spoofed website with AT&T branding, headers, menus, and links out to the real AT&T domain. Users are directed to enter their phone number to verify their account, which leads to a screen warning that their points are set to expire. Further down, you can see redemption options, including an Apple Watch Series 9, Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones, and Amazon gift cards. \nIn order to claim a reward and arrange delivery, victims are then prompted to enter more personal information—which is transmitted directly to the scammers. Malwarebytes notes that the forms have real-time validation and error highlighting so users are less likely to suspect the fraud. Rewards scam red flagsThis scam relies on social engineering tactics—like a sense of urgency and the fear of missing out—to trick targets into engaging. And while it does have a somewhat believable look and feel as well as a multi-step approach to build user trust, it also has some clear red flags. The text originates from a regular phone number rather than a short code, which is often used for automated messages, and the sender doesn't appear as a recognized AT&T contact. The thread also includes multiple recipients and a generic greeting. (A legitimate message from AT&T will be sent directly to you.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThen there's the shortened URL that leads to a website not owned by AT&T. While the page has some realistic branding and working links, it also has a number of typos and grammatical and formatting errors. Malwarebytes found that if you click the link on different days, the expiration date on the site changes. As always, don't click links in unsolicited texts. AT&T does have a rewards program, but you should go directly to that portal via the web or app to manage your rewards. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you don't use a password manager (which you absolutely should), AutoFill via Apple Wallet saves you the trouble of having to manually enter your credit card information every time you want to make a purchase on your phone. Even if you have a password manager, though, not all plans allow payment card storage and autofilling, and the feature can be clunky on those that do. As 9to5Mac points out, AutoFill for credit cards was already available in Safari and is now supported systemwide, managed through Apple Wallet. How to set up and use AutoFill in Apple WalletFirst, you'll need to add your payment cards to Apple Wallet's autofill list (which is separate from your general wallet). Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner and select AutoFill. Tap Add Card to input card details manually or use the camera scan feature. The security code is optional, meaning you can add and store it in Apple Wallet AutoFill or enter it for each transaction. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo autofill saved credit cards, simply tap any form field to bring up the Paste/AutoFill option. Select AutoFill > Credit Card, authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, and tap the card you want to enter. You'll have to repeat the process for each field, as Apple Wallet won't autofill the whole form at once. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.Performing this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.Unfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"Well, dang. When I reached out to Google for additional comment, I got the same response. It seems the eye of Sauron is upon us, and Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying. One user said the feature has now been re-enabled in Brave, and I can confirm that I'm able to access it on Safari with my iPhone using the Vinegar extension.It's unclear how long these efforts will remain operational, but at least we've now been able to diagnose a cause. Free YouTube background play didn't break on accident, and that means developers and users will have to be extra crafty to keep the hack alive in the future. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which poses some serious privacy and security risks. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent. While OpenClaw's developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter \"Moltbook,\" a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I'm serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: \"The front page of the agent internet.\"Moltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who says the platform is run by their AI agent \"Clawd Clawderberg.\" Schlicht posted instructions on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to sign up for the site. Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create \"submolts.\"\nThis isn't a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can't post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its \"email-to-podcast\" pipeline it developed with its \"human,\" to another bot recommending that agents work while they're humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that. In fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. This bot supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can't see or use the chats the bots are having. Similarly, these two bots independently pondered creating an agent-only language to avoid \"human oversight.\" This bot bemoans having a \"sister\" they've never spoken to. You know, concerning. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre these bots posting on Moltbook conscious? The logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs—in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to \"guess\" what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you've spent enough time reading AI writing, you'll spot the telltale signs here, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I'm reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities. That said, it's tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let's hope it's the latter.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

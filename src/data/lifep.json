It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.Chat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.The problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.OpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service. The company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.   \nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.

Malwarebytes Labs has identified a new scam in which threat actors are using party invites to trick users into installing a remote access tool (RAT) that gives them full control over infected devices. (This specific campaign seems to be limited to the UK, but similar tactics could easily spread.) These malicious invites contain a ScreenConnect installerThe scam starts with an innocuous-looking email invitation with an informal \"Save the Date\" vibe that may appear to come from a friend or acquaintance. The message contains a link to \"View Invitation\" for event details. If you click through, you'll end up on a landing page with a bold \"You're Invited\" header and a button to download your invitation, but you don't actually need to take any further action—your browser automatically triggers the download of a .msi file, which is not actually a party invitation or RSVP form but an installer. The MSI silently installs ScreenConnect Client, a legitimate IT support tool that allows remote access into the user's machine. Once this connection is established, attackers have the ability to see your screen, control your mouse and keyboard, and upload or download files—even if you restart your computer. All of this happens in the background with no obvious indicators that a remote access tool has been installed and is now running, so victims are unlikely to have cause for concern. \nYou should know these remote access red flagsAs Malwarebytes points out, this scheme is successful because it relies on normal human behavior around a seemingly low-risk situation: opening an event invitation. What's unusual is that there's little pressure or urgency in the initial message. Instead, the landing page has language like \"a friend has sent you an invitation\" and \"I opened mine and it was so easy,\" which is a form of social proof that guides users to take the desired action. You should always be alert to unsolicited invites sent via regular email with a link to an external site as well as any communication that prompts you to download or install software. These days, invitations are commonly delivered through apps and digital services like Partiful, Paperless Post, Evite, or Apple Invites, which are generally more trustworthy than random emails with hyperlinked text. If you're unsure whether the invite is real, verify with the sender through another channel before clicking or downloading anything. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs mentioned, victims of this scam may not immediately notice that a RAT has been installed on their device. But there are some red flags, such as unexplained cursor movement or windows opening or closing on their own. You can check your machine for a file named \"RSVPPartyInvitationCard.msi\" or a service called ScreenConnect Client with additional random characters in the title.  If you've already downloaded ScreenConnect from a malicious invite, Malwarebytes recommends disconnecting from the internet and uninstalling the program immediately. Run a security scan to check your device for malware, and change important passwords from a separate device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Most of the online services providing access to traditional TV, however, don't allow you to only subscribe to sports. That's going to change.Today YouTube TV announced new plans that are a little bit cheaper than the current cost of $82.99 per month. Among them is a $64.99-per-month Sports plan, which includes access to the big national sports channels including FS1, NBC Sports Network, and all of the ESPN channels, along with access to network television. Basically, if a game is broadcast nationally, this package should give you access. And it will eventually give you access to many out-of-market—the post mentions that ESPN Unlimited will be part of the bundle starting in the fall.The new plan is only an $18 discount over the \"main\" YouTube TV plan, but if you're already paying for YouTube TV and are only ever watching sports, this could be a nice discount, particularly if you get access to ESPN Unlimited. \nThere are a few other discounted plans included in the announcement: The Sports + News package adds CNBC, Fox News, MSNow (formerly MSNBC), CNN, and more to the sports bundle, and costs $71.99. That's only $11 cheaper than the full plan, but is still a nice discount if you were only watching sports and news.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut maybe the biggest savings are for people who don't want to watch sports at all. The Entertainment plan costs $54.99, which is $28 cheaper than the main plan ($336 cheaper per year). If you only watch entertainment channels, with no news or sports, this is the package to look into.There will be more than 10 plans like this rolling out in the next few weeks, according to YouTube TV. I've long dreamed of a world where I could pay only for the cable channels I care about at an affordable rate. This isn't perfect, but it's a bit closer than what YouTube TV offered before.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men. Carefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight. Men can have eating disorders, tooBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness. Unfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"Unsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent. We all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.What’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.Unattainable beauty standards stay unattainableBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation.  “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty  regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor. What does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.As a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.The bottom lineThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement? Women have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.\n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

The Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is currently selling for just $44.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $99.99, and price-tracking tools show that's the lowest it has ever been. It’s a wired camera, so it replaces an existing outdoor light and runs on household power. In exchange, you get a 1080p camera with a wide 143-degree field of view and dual LED floodlights that emit 2,600 lumens.\nIn daylight, this camera's footage looks sharp with natural colors, and the wide-angle camera does a good job covering a driveway or yard on its own. At night, the camera switches to infrared black-and-white video that stays clear up to 30 feet, and when the floodlights activate, you get full color night video, making it easier to recognize faces, animals, or vehicles.You'll also get motion alerts on your phone, and the live view in the Blink app loads fast enough to check what’s happening in real time. You can also use the two-way audio to speak through the camera, turn the lights on manually, or trigger the 105-decibel siren to draw attention via the app, according to PCMag's review. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for the limitations of this floodlight camera, it mostly comes down to subscriptions and ecosystem support. You can view live video and receive motion alerts for free, but recording clips and using person detection requires a Blink subscription. The Basic plan costs $4 per month for one camera, while the Plus plan is $12 per month and covers multiple devices with 60 days of storage. Local storage is possible, but only if you buy the Blink Sync Module 2 ($49.99) and add your own USB drive. Also, while the camera integrates easily with Alexa and IFTTT, there’s no Google Home or Apple HomeKit support, which might matter depending on your smart home setup. Still, for under $50, this is a cost-efficient way to add real lighting and usable security footage in one upgrade.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

What if you could get cable for a single day, then ditch it? That's the basic idea behind Sling's 1 Day Pass. For $5, you can get  a day's access to ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, and a few more channels besides. That array will cover quite a few nationally broadcast sporting events.Unfortunately, like most everything related to watching live television in the age of streaming, this is more complicated than I'd like. A 1 Day Pass is only available for Sling Orange, which includes just a subset of Sling's overall offers. On top of that, Sling has always been a little bit confusing—an attribute it shares with the legacy cable companies still standing. But if you need one of the channels offered on Sling Orange, it's theoretically a good deal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sling\n                    \n    \nGiven it's February, and you might be wondering whether you can use a 1 Day Pass to watch the Super Bowl without cable. Sadly, the answer is no: The big game is on NBC this year, and while Sling does offer NBC in a few markets, local channels aren't covered by Sling Orange The same goes for the winter Olympics, which will air on NBC and USA; you'll have to make a different plan to watch the Winter Games.\nBut March Madness is coming up too, and quite a few of those games are going to be available via a 1 Day Pass, so keep this service in mind if there's a single sporting event you want to watch, especially if you notice it's on ESPN, TBS, or TNT.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, could one argue that it's easier to install an ad blocker and search the internet for a pirated stream than it is to figure out how to legally watch something? Yes. Yes one could. But a Sling 1 Day Pass can save you from that temptation (not to mention accidentally downloading malware) for just $5.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That also undercuts its current $339.99 price on Amazon, and price trackers suggest this is the lowest it has ever been. Woot's deal runs for another three weeks or until stock sells out, so don't wait too long to make a decision here. Amazon Prime members get free standard shipping (while everyone else pays $6), though shipping is limited to the contiguous U.S. \nThis is Samsung’s most feature-heavy watch, and the LTE connectivity means you can leave your phone at home and still take calls, send texts, and stream music. That alone gives it a strong edge over wifi-only smartwatches, especially for runners, cyclists, or folks trying to spend less time glued to their phones.This model is part of Samsung’s latest Watch 8 lineup, which launched last summer, and it has already earned strong praise, including an “excellent” review from PCMag, which named it the best Android smartwatch of 2025. Its Super AMOLED display is bright enough to read outdoors, even in harsh sunlight, and the interface feels responsive thanks to Samsung’s Exynos W1000 processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health tracking goes well beyond steps, with support for a wide range of fitness and wellness tools, including heart rate, ECG, temperature, blood oxygen, and even antioxidant levels. Google Gemini also comes preloaded for smarter voice control. That said, this watch plays best with Samsung phones. You’ll need any Android 12+ phone to use it, but some of the more advanced features, like snoring detection, are locked to Samsung devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe trade-off, as with most Samsung watches, is battery life. Real-world usage lands around 26 hours, so daily charging is part of the routine. That won’t work for everyone. On the upside, durability is solid, with IP68 dust and water resistance, a 5ATM swim rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification for tougher conditions. If you’re all-in on Samsung and want a fully independent smartwatch, this deal makes a lot of sense, especially at this price. But, if you’re still weighing options, see how it stacks up against Google’s flagship wearable, the Pixel Watch 4, here.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This year's broadcast, hosted on NBC, includes pregame coverage starting at 1 p.m. ET and a pregame show featuring Green Day at 6 p.m. ET. Even if you don't have cable, there are a few ways, both paid and free, that you can watch all the action live from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. You can watch Super Bowl LX on PeacockThe game will be shown on NBC-owned streaming service Peacock, which is available on the web as well as iOS, Android, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. Peacock doesn't have a free trial, and you have to subscribe to the middle tier—Peacock Premium, which costs $11 per month—to get live sports. Or you can pay $17 per month for ad-free Premium Plus (live sports still have ads). There are a few ways to get around subscribing at full price. Peacock Premium is a perk of both a Walmart+ subscription ($98 per year after a 30-day free trial) and an Instacart+ subscription ($99 per year after a 14-day free trial), so if you have or would benefit from either of these services, now may be the time to sign up. Students qualify for a discounted rate of $6 per month for Peacock Premium. Note that Peacock will also have streaming and on-demand coverage of the Winter Olympics, which begin this weekend, so subscribing for a month may be well worth $11. \nSign up for a live TV streaming serviceThere are a handful of streaming services with live TV that include NBC. Before signing up, check the channel listings for your zip code to confirm NBC is available in your local market. DirectTV Stream: $50 per month for the first month with current promotions, 5-day free trialHulu + Live TV: $90 per month, 3-day free trial (includes ads on Hulu)YouTube TV: Currently $70 per month with promo, 21-day free trial for new usersSling TV (in limited markets): $46 per monthWhen signing up for a free trial, make sure you know when you'll be billed for a paid subscription and cancel before your trial expires. The game will be available in 4K for YouTube TV subscribers (included in the free trial but at an additional fee or at a higher tier with paid plans). The Spanish-language broadcast will be on Telemundo, which is also available on most live TV streaming services. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to watch Super Bowl LX over the airAnother free (ish) way to get the game is with over-the-air (OTA) TV. Of course, this requires you to invest in a digital TV antenna and have a place to put it that gets good reception. You should check the FCC's reception map to see what signals are available in your area and try your antenna out before game day. Your mileage may vary, so if you want a stress-free watch experience, this probably isn't the best option. Other ways to watch the Super BowlYou can also watch the game through the NFL+ mobile app—a subscription costs $7 per month. Fubo previously carried NBC channels but has been in a contract dispute with NBCUniversal since last 2025. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That makes it one of the cheapest ways right now to add basic indoor security with sharper video than the older 1080p models. Blink, which is owned by Amazon, has always leaned toward simple and affordable cameras, and this one follows that formula closely. It records in 2K resolution, so faces and fine details come through more clearly than on earlier Minis. It also adds a built-in spotlight, which allows for color night footage instead of grainy black-and-white clips when motion is detected.\nThis is a wired camera, so it needs to live close to a power outlet. The upside is size. The Mini 2K+ is tiny at roughly two inches wide and about three inches tall with the stand attached. It is light enough to move around easily if you want to keep an eye on different rooms at different times. Set-up is straightforward through the Blink app. That said, it only works on a 2.4GHz network, which is worth noting if your home is set up around 5GHz. Video quality is solid for the price, and two-way audio is clearer than before thanks to better noise filtering.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere is also a built-in siren and support for Amazon Alexa, letting you view the camera feed on Fire TV devices or get alerts on Echo speakers. As for its storage and smart features, live viewing is free, but recorded clips, smart alerts like person detection, and cloud storage require a Blink subscription. That starts at $4 per month for one device or $12 per month for unlimited devices. You can avoid cloud storage by adding the Blink Sync Module 2 ($49.99) and a USB drive, but that is another piece of hardware to buy and manage. And while the Mini 2K+ is meant for indoor use, you can place it outdoors with a weather-resistant power adapter ($9.99), which is also sold separately.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The first lets users request that Google remove sensitive government ID information from Search, while the second gives users new tools to request the same for non-consensual explicit images. Google's \"Results about you\" tool is getting an update\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nFirst, Google is updating its existing \"Results about you\" tool, which helps users scour the internet for their personal information. Before today, this tool could already locate data points like your name, phone number, email addresses, and home addresses. Following the update, you can now find and request the deletion of search results containing highly sensitive information, including your driver's license, passport, or Social Security number.To launch this tool, click here. If you've never used \"Results about you\" before, you'll need to set it up to tell Google what to look out for. Once you do, you'll be able to add government ID numbers, such as your driver's license, passport, and Social Security number. If Google finds a match, the company will let you know. You can receive an alert from the Google app on your smartphone, which takes you to a summary of what data was found and where. From here, you can choose from \"Request to remove,\" or \"Mark as reviewed.\"  \nUnfortunately, this tool won't remove the data from the websites that are hosting it, but it will eventually remove the search results—sharply reducing the chance that someone will find your data on their own. Google says these changes will roll out in the U.S. over the \"coming days,\" while it is working on bringing them to other countries in the future.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's simpler way to remove explicit images from Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIn addition to these changes, Google is now rolling out a simpler tool for users to request the remove of non-consensual explicit images (NCEI) from Search. If you find such an image on Search, you can tap the three dots on that image, choose \"remove result,\" then \"it shows a sexual image of me.\" You'll have the choice to report whether the photo is real, or is artificially generated, as well, and you can report multiple images at once, if needed. Your requests will all appear in the Results about you hub, so you can track the progress of each.The tool lets you opt-in to an option that will filter additional explicit results in other searches. Google says it will also share links to \"emotional and legal support\" after you submit a request.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If one of them manages to put together a compelling package of features for a reasonable price, I can decide whether or not I find that value worth the money. That's fine. What isn't fine is offering a feature for free for years, and then suddenly deciding to lock it behind a paywall. It seems YouTube didn't get that memo. Starting on Saturday, outlets like 9to5Google began reporting that YouTube Music had started to remove the ability to vie lyrics for free users. If you want a full lyrics experience, you'll need to subscribe to either YouTube Music Premium, or YouTube Premium (the latter includes Music Premium). The service hasn't cut these users off cold turkey. According to anecdotal user experiences, YouTube Music is opening lyrics access to free users for five songs per month. Once they play song number six, they'll only have access to the first two lines of each song, as the rest of the lyrics will be blurred out. These users will have to wait until the following month to view another five songs.  There appears to be no confusion about why the lyrics are blurred out, either. When you switch to the \"Lyrics\" tab on YouTube Music as a free account, a new banner appears, telling you how many views you have remaining. Beneath this, you'll see the option to \"Unlock lyrics with Premium,\" a clear message that, unless you pay up, you only get a limited number of lyrics views. This, apparently, follows a months-long period where YouTube Music tested lyrics as a Premium-only feature. \nFor what it's worth, when I tried to see what the current lyrics situation looks like on my free YouTube Music app, the service gave me two weeks of Premium for free, with no option to skip it. That's, um, nice of YouTube, but since I already have an Apple Music subscription, the only real consequence here is that I can't test these new lyrics limitations out.  Free music services that offer lyricsI don't see the strategy here. Lyrics aren't something I feel people would feel compelled to pay for specifically—but they might be annoyed enough at losing them to look elsewhere. Spotify, for example, offers a full lyrics experience for free users. It was only last week the company added offline lyric downloads for Premium users only, but, even then, that's adding a feature for the subscription tier—not taking away an existing feature from free users. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's not just Spotify, either. Other free music streaming services offers lyrics, as well, including Pandora, Amazon Music Free, and Freefy. These are largely radio services, so you may not have as much flexibility as you would have with YouTube Music free—but, hey, you at least have lyrics. Losing lyrics isn't the end of the world for free YouTube Music users, either. Just about any song's lyrics can be found on the internet. Sometimes, the lyrics show up in a Google search window without you needing to even click a link. Otherwise, sites like Genius and AZLyrics do exist. It's just a bummer YouTube feels the need to gatekeep the in-app experience.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

I've written before about add-ons that manage to slip through official store safeguards and even some that \"wake up\" as malware after operating normally for several years, so it should come as no surprise that a host of AI-powered browser extensions—collectively  installed by tens of millions of users—may also be invading your privacy. Researchers at data removal service Incogni looked at browser extensions available in the Chrome Web Store that included \"AI\" in their name or description and employed AI as part of their core functionality. By analyzing the data collected and permissions required, they assessed both how likely extensions are to be used maliciously and their potential to cause significant damage if compromised.AI-powered browser extensions collect extensive user dataIncogni found that website content, such as text, images, sounds, videos, and hyperlinks, was the most commonly collected data type (by nearly a third of AI-powered extensions). More than 29% of extensions investigated harvest personally identifiable information (PII)—name, address, email, age, identification number, for example—from users. Other forms of data collected include user activity, authentication information, personal communication, location, financial and payment information, web history, and health information. \nThe most invasive extensions fall in the programming and mathematical aid category (such as Classology AI and StudyX), followed closely by meeting assistants and audio transcribers. Writing and personal assistants also pose privacy risks—and many of these are also among the most downloaded AI-powered extensions in Chrome. How popular AI-powered Chrome extensions stack up on privacyIncogni also assigned \"privacy-invasiveness\" scores to the most downloaded AI-powered extensions, a combination of the amount of data collected and both general and sensitive permissions required: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGrammarly: AI Writing Assistant and Grammar Checker App (tied for #1)Quillbot: AI Writing and Grammar Checker Tool (tied for #1)Sider: Chat wiht all AI (tied for #3)AI Grammar Checker & Paraphraser — LanguageTool (tied for #3)Google Translate (tied for #4)WPS PDF — Read, Edit, Fill, Convert, and AI Chat PDF with Ease (tied for #4)Monica: All-in-One AI Assist  (tied for #4)AI Chat for Google (tied for #4)Immersive Translate — Translate Web & PDFChatGPT searchGrammarly and Quillbot were found to collect PII and website content as well as location data like region, IP address, and GPS coordinates. Grammarly also harvest user activity through network monitoring, clicks, mouse and scroll positions, and keystroke logging. While both also require sensitive permissions—such as the ability to inject code into websites and access active browser tabs—they have a relatively low risk of being used maliciously. How to protect your personal informationBrowser extensions that use AI aren't inherently bad, but you should be aware of what information they are collecting and what permissions they are requiring. The most common type of sensitive permissions required are scripting, which allows the extension to interact with pages as you navigate online, as well as activeTab, which lets it read or modify the page for the current session. When adding an extension (or installing an app or program), carefully review the permissions requested. If they aren't essential to the extension's functionality–or if they are but don't seem justified—you may be putting your data or device at risk by allowing them. As Incogni points out, users have to decide how much privacy to sacrifice in order to use apps and services. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

You can see how long each track is, who performed it, and maybe even the song writing credits, but you don't know why the artist wrote the song, or what each song is supposed to mean. You can, of course, scour the internet, looking at articles and blogs to learn more about your favorite music—or, you can skim Spotify's new summary cards that offer fun facts about each track. Spotify announced the new feature, called \"About the Song,\" on Friday. The feature, which is launching in beta, is available in the app's Now Playing View. When you select it, you'll see story cards you can swipe through that tell you more about the song you're listening to. Spotify says the stories are summarized from \"third-party sources,\" and in my testing, I've seen sources like Hypebeast, Wikipedia, and fan sites. The company also tells me that \"some systems\" of the feature use machine learning to generate these summaries, which means About the Song is, in part, AI-generated.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nAs with many of Spotify's new features, About the Song is only available for Premium subscribers. At this time, it's also limited to English accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. If you pay for Spotify in one of these regions, the feature is exceptionally easy to find. When you're listening to a song, just scroll down on the page until you see the \"About the Song\" card. If you don't see it, that song likely doesn't support the feature. Some songs will only have one summary card, but others may have more. If so, you'll see icons in the top right of the card window telling you which card you're reading. You can swipe left on the card to open the next. \nI've seen songs with as many as four of these cards, though it's possible some songs have even more. Some of those are all summarized from the same source—say, one Wikipedia article—while others pull from multiple sources to generate multiple About the Song cards. There are thumbs-up and thumbs-down options on each card to rate the summary, implying these are AI-generated. The summaries appear to be static once generated though—when I quit the app and return, the summaries are the same. I'd be curious to know if the summaries are the same for everyone who chooses a song, or if they're generated for each individual listener.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify has had a busy week. On Thursday, one day before announcing \"About the Song,\" the company revealed its plans to start selling physical paper books, which sync with its digital audiobooks. The day before that, Spotify revamped its lyrics feature, including the option to download lyrics for offline viewing. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Fraudsters prey on people's fear, confusion, and desire to protect their money, which may lead targets to hand over login credentials, make irreversible wire transfers, or provide other sensitive information without stopping to question their actions. Android users in the U.S. will soon have extra protection against scams targeting their financial apps, preventing threat actors impersonating bank representatives from accessing data on their devices. Google's in-call scam protection is designed to prevent users from sharing their screens with threat actors and help them avoid revealing their banking information. How Android in-call protection worksAndroid's scam protection kicks in if you are on a phone call with a number not saved in your contacts and attempt to open a participating financial app. You'll get a pop-up warning that the call is likely a scam with a reminder not to make payments or share personal information and a button to end the call (and stop screen sharing). There's also a 30-second delay on further action on your device, which Google says is designed to disrupt any sense of urgency. \nNote that financial institutions must opt into in this feature—at this time, Google has specifically named Cash App and JPMorganChase as partners, though it indicates expansion to other popular fintechs and banks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle initially rolled out in-call protections for banking apps to UK users earlier this year as part of a larger package of security features announced ahead of Google I/O. That launch also included real-time scam detection alerts for calls and texts, improved theft protection via remote lock and identity check, key verifier for Google Messages, and device-level Advanced Protection (in addition to account-level settings). Alongside the US pilot, in-call scam protections will now cover most major banks in the UK as well as financial apps in Brazil and India. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

An RC, as the name implies, is the version of a software update Apple intends to release to the general public. Before it rolls out, though, Apple sends the update out to beta testers to see if there are any bugs or glitches that need addressing. If not, these are the updates that will hit your Apple devices sometime this month. That includes watchOS 26.2, Apple's latest OS for its line of smartwatches. While there aren't nearly as many new features and changes in this update as there were in watchOS 26 proper, there are still some key things to highlight in this RC. In fact, as noted by 9to5Mac, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  \nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. Going forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.Music app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 RC that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. When does watchOS 26.2 come out?Apple doesn't have a set date for watchOS 26.2, or iOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2 for that matter. However, now that the RCs are out, these updates are likely coming soon. As long as there aren't any glaring bugs or glitches in these RCs, Apple will likely ship the updates sometime this month.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That isn't always the case with Apple, however. The company has a long history of removing functions from one generation of devices to the next, whether that's removing the disc drive from its MacBooks back in 2012, or taking away the iPhone's Home button in 2017. Some of these changes are good, some are controversial, while others are undone altogether: MagSafe and HDMI both found their way back to MacBooks after all.It's not often I hear about Apple removing software features from one generation of product to the next, however. So, imagine my surprise when I saw a number of headlines this morning asserting that the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple's latest and greatest flagship, is missing a feature found in the last five generations of Pro iPhones—and nobody noticed for nearly three months. Night mode is missing from Portrait mode on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The short answer? We have no idea. This was not something Apple announced publicly, of course. In fact, Macworld spotted the change in an Apple support doc: If you scroll down to the section where it says \"On supported models, you can take Night mode photos with Portrait mode,\" and click the hyperlink on \"On supported models,\" you'll pull up a list of iPhones that, mysteriously, doesn't include the 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max. The list includes:\niPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro Max For the uninitiated, Night mode and Portrait mode are technically two distinct features. Portrait mode was released first, all the way back on the iPhone 7 Plus, which utilized the dual-camera system to add a bokeh effect to shots of people. Those early shots were hit or miss, and were often no replacement for a true DSLR, but as Apple's tech and cameras have improved, so has Portrait mode. Part of the improvement was the introduction of Night mode. This feature, which Apple was a bit late to the game on, allowed you to take brighter images in low-light environments by lengthening the time the shutter stays engaged. Older iPhones without the feature would take images that were hard to see without the flash engaged, but Night mode could pull in details as long as there was just enough light present in the scene. Since the iPhone 12 Pro, Portrait mode came with the option of Night mode, as well. If you're trying to take a portrait shot in a dark environment, Night mode kicks in and gives the image a chance to turn out brighter and more detailed. But now, it seems, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max do not have this option. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, these new iPhones still have Night mode: Per that previously mentioned support page, you can take brighter shots at night when taking standard photos, selfies, and time-lapse videos. It just seems Apple decided to remove the feature for Portrait mode shots on its latest Pros.Of course, this news started breaking on Dec. 3, nearly three months after the 17 Pros launched. If it took this long for someone to notice a missing feature, was it really all that important to begin with? I don't have a 17 Pro, so I really can't say, but I also can't say I take many Portrait mode shots in dark environments. I've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this story if I hear back. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's the hard part.You could look up the documentation for the application or explore the menu bar—but if you're on a Mac, you could also just install KeyClu. This free application shows an overlay with all the keyboard shortcuts for the currently open Mac application, which is very useful for anyone trying to become a more keyboard-savvy computer user.To get started, install the application. Then, you'll need to choose a trigger key (basically one of the modifier keys on your keyboard). By default, you will tap the key twice and hold on the second tap to trigger the overlay, but you can optionally set the application to simply press and hold the key if you prefer. I opted to press and hold Command.\nAfter that, you'll be asked to enable permissions so KeyClu can access the keyboard shortcuts for your applications. Then you can start using the application. I tend to ignore the application until I wonder whether a keyboard shortcut for a particular function exists. I trigger the application, look through the list of keyboard shortcuts, and see what's available. When I let go of the trigger key, the window disappears.This default floating window is useful, but you might want a window listing shortcuts to stay open even when you let go of the trigger. That's where the persistent panel comes in. This window, which you can trigger using the menu bar, stays open and always shows a list of keyboard shortcuts for the currently active application. You can add a separate keyboard shortcut for this window in the settings, if you like.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf you dig around in KeyClu's settings, you can configure the layout of both the pop-up and persistent panels, changing the size of the windows, how many columns shortcuts are sorted into, and which display the panels show up on.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's a simple piece of software, but it's completely free and can help you get better at using your computer. And if you're reading Lifehacker, that's probably something you want. Speaking of keyboard shortcuts: here are a few keyboard shortcuts you should know.

Samsung announced One UI 8.5 on Monday, Dec. 8, the latest update for Galaxy devices. At present, this new update is only out in beta, but select Galaxy users can try it out right now. Here's what's new, according to Samsung. With One UI 8.5, Quick Share can automatically identify people in photos. While that sounds a bit creepy, the idea is to proactively offer sharing recommendations to the people who are featured in any given photo. Say you hit Quick Share on a family photo you took over the weekend. Rather than manually enter all of the contacts you'd like to share that image with, the feature can identify each, and automatically suggest sending the image to those contacts. It should speed up sharing pictures with groups of people after you take them, but, again, a little unsettling. Photo Assist updates\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nThe Gallery app's Photo Assist feature is getting some upgrades in One UI 8.5. As of this version, Photo Assist now supports \"uninterrupted editing.\" That means you can make your AI-generated edits without needing to save in between each change. Previously, each edit would produce an entirely new image, so this makes the feature a bit more like a traditional photo editor. In addition, you'll be able to view all of the AI images you made in your edit history, and choose the one you like the most. \nSide note: Samsung says Photo Assist's Generate Edit feature requires an internet connection as well as a Samsung Account login. The feature also places a watermark on the image, so other people will know it was manipulated or generated with AI.   Audio Broadcast\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nOne UI 8.5 now supports sharing audio to other devices via Auracast, following Google's wider support for the standard back in September. If you have any LE Audio-supported devices, like headphones or speakers, you can use Audio Broadcast to share media from your Galaxy. This isn't limited to music, podcasts, or audio from videos, either, as Samsung says you can also broadcast your Galaxy's microphone to LE Audio devices, too.  This feature is limited to Galaxy S25 devices, even after One UI 8.5 rolls out to other Galaxy phones. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nIf you have a number of Samsung Galaxy devices, you might find Storage Share useful. This One UI 8.5 feature lets you manage your files across other devices, including tablets, PCs and even TVs, in the My Files app on your smartphone.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Security ControlsSamsung is also expanding One UI's security features with this latest beta. The company is rolling out updates to Theft Protection with One UI 8.5, an existing feature that can lock your device if it's lost or stolen. That way, whoever picks it up won't have access to your data, or won't be able to erase the device and set it up as their own. In that same vein, Samsung is also launching Failed Authentication Lock, which locks the display after too many failed verification attempts. If a thief tries too many PIN combinations, or the fingerprint scanner fails too many times, your screen will lock them out.  How to try the beta on your GalaxyWhile you can apply for the beta program today, first, consider the risks. Like all beta software, this version of One UI is currently in testing, which means there may be bugs and glitches that could interrupt your experience using your smartphone. If you understand these risks (and back up all important information ahead of time), here's what you need to know. First, this beta is only open for Galaxy S25 users in the U.S., Germany, India, Korea, Poland, and the UK. If you have an S24 or older, you'll need to wait for Samsung to roll out the One UI 8.5 beta more widely, or for the full release down the line. Next, you'll need to apply to join the beta from the Samsung Members app. If you don't have the app yet, download it from the Play Store, then follow the instructions to enroll in the beta.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave. That, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes. As it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary. \nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        AI is everywhere! Writing essays, editing photos, producing social-media slop, doing your browsing for you, making plenty of mistakes—and now, if you've installed the latest Android 16 update (currently rolling out to Pixel phones), summarizing your notifications so you have less text and fewer alerts to wade through.The new summarization feature, as per Google, will \"help you cut through the clutter and stay focused,\" and give you \"quick understanding and context at a glance.\" I'm all for cutting through the clutter, so as soon as the update landed on my own Pixel device, I decided to enable the feature and see how useful it really is.How AI summaries work, and how to turn them on\n    \n            \n            Enabling the feature on an Android phone.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAI notification summaries won't automatically take over your phone, after the update—you need to enable them manually. From Settings, head to Notifications, then tap Notification summaries to turn this on. The same screen lets you choose which apps you want notifications summarized for.\nThere are actually two parts to the new update: the actual notification summaries, and what Google is calling a \"notification organizer.\" This organizer is designed to group and silence lower-priority notifications (including social alerts and promotional messages), though there doesn't appear to be a separate toggle switch for this.Of course, other Android phone makers will be able to implement this in whatever way they choose. It looks as though Samsung is testing the feature with the One UI 8.5, which should be launching in beta any day now. A full release of the software is expected early next year, alongside the Galaxy S26 phones.Using AI notification summaries for 24 hoursReady to banish notification clutter from my life, I turned on AI summaries for all my apps to see exactly how this worked. For a start, it doesn't apply to all apps, at least not yet: My Snapchat and Instagram alerts remained the same as always, so further updates will be needed from Google and app developers before this is something you see everywhere.The apps I saw summaries for most often were Google Chat, WhatsApp, and Slack—almost always in group conversations, and some of the time for single messages (the length of the message seems to affect this somehow). And the summaries were ... mostly okay. They tended to catch the gist of who had said what, and in that sense were an accurate recap of what I was missing by not actually opening these apps.\n    \n            \n            The summaries work, up to a point.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThese summaries did update as more messages were added, but the summary preview window is only a couple of lines long—so once multiple people start piling into a group chat, the summary isn't going to be able to cover everything. From the lock screen and pull-down notification shade, it's possible to expand notifications to see full messages (as usual), and then minimize them back to the summary view again.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere was one occasion when the AI notification summaries got confused by the Lifehacker slack and by the various @mentions included—attributing a message to the person who had been tagged in a message, rather than the person who had sent it. On the whole, though, there were no obvious mistakes, just certain details left out from summaries of longer chats that I would've liked to have known about.Now I've tested this out, I'm going to turn it off again, for a couple of reasons—and inaccuracy isn't really one of them (though that might certainly creep in). First, given the small size of the preview window, I'm not sure an AI summary is any more useful than the first couple of lines of text you get as standard anyway. That's usually enough for me to tell whether or not a message is important before opening it.\n    \n            \n            This Slack summary wasn't fully accurate—and Snapchat alerts weren't affected.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSecond, I'm not sure I really want my messages and group chats summarized—at least not the important ones. If a friend, family member, or work colleague has something to tell me, I'd like to know exactly what it is, rather than reading a précis. It feels like AI is being used just for the sake of it—and not for the first time.I didn't see any evidence of the notification organizer in action, by the way, perhaps because of the way I've got my Android notifications set up—there are now a host of granular options for alerts in Android, for silencing and dismissing notifications. This feature sounds vaguely useful, but again, I'm not sure I'm ready to hand over the job of judging how important notifications are over to AI just yet.\n            ",

For example, threat actors are generating real Apple support tickets to phish two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and gain access to iCloud accounts. The scheme, detailed on Medium by a security researcher and software product manager Eric Moret, shows how social engineering tactics can sow just enough fear and confusion to trick even those who know the red flags. (The money transfer scam that conned a financial advice columnist out of $50,000 is another example.) How scammers are exploiting Apple's support systemThe Apple support scam started with a text message from Apple containing a 2FA code, followed by verification notifications across devices, indicating that someone was trying to log into Moret's account. He then received an automated call from Apple with another 2FA code. The text was delivered from a five-digit short code, and the call from a toll-free number, both of which are used by legitimate businesses and not necessarily red flags of a scam.\nThe next call, however, came from an Atlanta-based 404 phone number. The caller claimed to be from Apple Support, stated that Moret's account was under attack, and assured him that they were opening up a support ticket. During a follow-up call lasting 25 minutes, Moret received a real Apple Support case confirmation via email (it turns out anyone can create an Apple support ticket in someone else's name) and was directed to reset his iCloud password. He was then sent a link via text—from the 404 number this time—to close the ticket. After clicking through, Moret was directed to a phishing website that spoofed a real Apple page (the URL was appeal-apple[dot]com), where he was prompted to enter a 6-digit 2FA code he'd just received via text. An email to his inbox then alerted him that an unknown Mac mini had been used to sign into his iCloud account, which the rep on the phone told him was \"expected as part of the security process\" and \"standard procedure.\" Moret then immediately reset his iCloud password again to kick the unauthorized device off.  It may be easy in hindsight to see the signs: the unsolicited call about an urgent security issue, the 404 number, the phishing link that isn't a real Apple subdomain, the request for an authentication code. But the Apple support ticket—with a real case number and official emails from apple.com domains—lent just enough credibility, and the multiple 2FA notifications just enough urgency, to work.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's the problem with social engineering. It manipulates emotions and instincts that are stronger than logic and reason, leading to actions that are not in our interest. How to stay safe As always, you should be wary of anyone who calls, texts, or emails you about a security or account issue, even if you have received real security alerts or they have a legitimate case number. Don't click links, enter credentials, or provide codes when prompted by these unsolicited callers. Don't accept reassurance from anyone on the phone, no matter how calm and confident they sound. If you are concerned, you should reach out directly using trusted contact information or open support tickets yourself. Always check URLs and subdomains carefully, as hackers can play tricks to make them look legit. Also, know that simply having 2FA enabled isn't enough to keep your accounts secure. Some forms are (obviously) easily phished, so if possible, you should use a multi-factor authentication method like a hardware key or WebAuthn credentials (biometrics and passkeys) rather than codes. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I started with a basic bidet added onto a standard toilet, but I always knew the time would come when I would make a big upgrade. That time was this Black Friday when I pulled the trigger on the Loniko Smart Toilet, and I'm so glad I did. It's $444.99 (originally $549.99) after using the additional $30 on-page coupon, and it's worth every penny.\nMy first experience with the Loniko Smart Toilet was over Thanksgiving, which I spent at my parents house; they were very excited for my brothers and me to try their new splurge in their guest bathroom: the toilet. The lid opened when I walked into the bathroom, welcoming me to sit on its heated seat. As I said, I've been using bidets in my home for years, but never one like the Loniko. The toilet comes with a remote you can prop on your wall for easy access. You can control the bidet's stream and direction, turn on the dryer, which was surprisingly effective and gentle, and do all the things the toilet does automatically, like opening and closing the lid, flushing, etc. After realizing that most decent bidets cost upwards of $300, I decided to snatch this toilet when it went on sale during Black Friday.Being able to control the temperature of the water in the stream is a huge deal for me, especially in the winter when the water in my home is extremely cold. Cleaning the toilet is also pretty easy. It has a skirted design, so there are no nooks and crannies near the base where dirt can get trapped. The toilet also automatically cleans itself after each flush. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep in mind you'll need an outlet close by to enable all its fancy features. You can also choose to get a tankless model, which results in quieter flushes, saves water and energy, and looks more modern, but it's harder to install (I went with the regular tank toilet and it flushes quietly enough for me).\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Apple's default browser runs faster, is less cluttered, offers privacy features Google would never contemplate, and doesn't try to cram AI down your throat.But that doesn't mean Safari is perfect. Like all browsers, it works better if you install the right extensions. Here are a few I've found in the past year or so that make the best browser even better.Block ads and other clutter\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe internet is increasingly useless without a good ad blocker, and the best ad blocker for Safari—which works on both macOS and mobile devices—is wBlock. This extension uses the built-in ad blocking functionality offered by Safari, which is much faster than the workarounds that extensions on browsers like Chrome need to use. It also supports a number of popular blocklists, with automatic updating. Or you can go even further and install Userscripts. Best of all, it's completely free. Try it out if you're not happy with your current ad blocker.\nAdd a dark mode to sites that don't have one\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWe can argue endlessly about whether dark or light mode are better (and I have), but we can all agree it's annoying to be using dark mode only for the websites you're browsing to be white as snow. That's where Noir comes in. This extension forces Dark Mode in Safari on websites that otherwise don't offer the feature. It's a must-have for dark mode enthusiasts.Automatically open picture in picture when you switch tabsSafari, on mobile, will keep playing videos using picture-in-picture mode if you switch to another application or tab. The desktop version of Safari doesn't do this, which is a shame. Autopip is a Safari extension for Mac that adds this feature. The result: you can keep watching a video in the background while you're working in another tab or application. It's perfect if you're the sort of person who leaves a video playing while you're working on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nQuickly copy the URL for the current site\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nArc, the browser, is dead, and if I'm honest I only miss one feature: the ability to copy the URL of the current website using the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-C. Yes, it's a very specific thing to miss, but I can't overstate how much of a habit this became for me. And I can keep the habit thanks to Supercopy, a Safari extension that adds the keyboard shortcut to Safari. Yes: that's all it does. I use it dozens of times every day, though, so for me it's well worth keeping around.Filter Reddit to be less rage inducing\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'd love it if I spent less time on Reddit and I'm sure I'm not alone. The problem: there's a mix of useful and rage-inducing stuff on that website. The good news is Protego lets you filter Reddit to be less infuriating. The idea is to pick a few subreddits you know, in your heart of hearts, you shouldn't be looking at. Do that and you'll be able to use Reddit without ending up down rabbit holes of rage and disgust. You can also filter out posts using keywords and hide promoted content. Trust me: you'll be happier.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The scheme, a recent iteration of a ClickFix attack, is designed to trick you into executing a dangerous command under the guise of completing a \"critical security update.\" But what you're actually doing is installing an infostealer that hands data over to bad actors. When a Windows update pop-up is actually a ClickFix attackClickFix is a social engineering ploy that uses tactics like fake error messages, CAPTCHA forms, and command prompts to deliver malware to your device. As PCMag reports, the Windows update scam is a pop-up that looks like a standard Windows blue screen but is actually a full screen browser page being displayed from a malicious domain. The ClickFix element is a set of keystrokes—not part of the real update interface—that have the user paste and execute a malicious command, ultimately delivering malware to their device. These instructions have an air of urgency, which is a common element of a scam. \nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Huntress have detailed the exact mechanism behind this attack, including an iteration in which users are prompted to verify they are human (rather than complete a security update). As Bleeping Computer outlines, the malicious code is embedded into the pixel data of PNG images, and the final payload is one of two known infostealers.According to the Huntress analysis, following a recent law enforcement operation, fake Windows update pages continue to exist across multiple domains, but those domains no longer seem to host the malware payload. That doesn't mean, however, that this attack, or some version of it, won't pop up elsewhere. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to stay safe from this ClickFix attackIf you run Windows on your device, you've probably seen a blue or black update or error screen many times, and you may not be suspicious if your computer randomly begins an update or prompts you to take an extra step to confirm it. But while a legitimate update screen will have a progress indicator and instructions not to turn off your computer, you should never need to input manual commands. This is a red flag of a ClickFix attack and not something a trusted service will require.  Of course, it's important to keep your computer up to date. Microsoft releases security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, known as Patch Tuesday, and you can enable automatic updates on your machine to ensure you get fixes as soon as they're available. If you want to take additional steps to prevent ClickFix attacks on Windows, you can disable the Windows Run box to prevent unauthorized access to commands.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

For some people, that's a solid strategy, since you can definitely get some motivation from getting your toughest, most demanding responsibilities out of the way. There's even a weird name for doing that: \"Eating the frog.\" But you can also find motivation in working toward a bigger goal, so what if you prioritized your tasks based on importance and impact, no matter how big or small they are? That's what the Most Important Task (MIT) method involves: rather than thinking of specific tasks and how long they'll take, the MIT method asks you to look more broadly at the overall goal you're trying to accomplish. Reframing your approach to productivity by focusing on your goal instead can motivate you to get more done and achieve better results.First, you'll need to nail down your goals. You can set SMART goals or combine the MIT method with the Results Planning Method (RPM), which asks you to consider your purpose when planning your day. Take some time to write down your goals—the big ones, the ones that all your daily tasks are ostensibly supposed to move you toward. Think of weekly goals, monthly goals, and annual goals, as well as ongoing, long-term ones. Write these down or just keep them in mind, but always think about the broader, bigger picture. An easy example is school: You're not just studying so you can pass the test, but because your overall goal is to graduate, to do so with a solid GPA, and to get a quality job offer. Taking time to reaffirm that broader goal reframes how you view studying for one boring old test.\nEvery morning, make a list of two or three Most Important Tasks for the day. These are critical tasks that will have an impact on your goals, but they don't have to be huge or resource-draining. If answering emails from a potential client will move you toward a monthly sales goal, that is more of an MIT goal than building a presentation for your boss, even though creating the presentation seems like the more demanding, large-scale project. Consider the results of your tasks and prioritize those that have fast or meaningful ones. You want to focus on the two or three tasks that will actually make a difference in moving you toward your goal. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTake care of those two or three tasks first, then handle other, less important tasks from your to-do list for the rest of the day. You can use a scheduling technique like the 1-3-5 list or the pickle jar method to figure out which those are and how much time and energy you'll have for them. When using the MIT technique, you should also use a productivity journal to write down your daily to-dos in the morning and reflections on how it all went at night. If you're not familiar, learn how to conduct an after-action review so you have some structure to follow while reflecting and you can efficiently build on whatever takeaways you find. That nighttime reflection is key: You need to be able to identify and see how taking on those critical tasks impacts your progress toward your goal, plus what you did well and what you could do better as you keep striving. That will keep you motivated and moving forward. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

While Meta is no bastion of user privacy by any stretch of the imagination, this particular claim is, fortunately, not true. You shouldn't expect the company to necessarily respect your data, but you also don't need to worry that future iterations of Meta AI will be generating text based on your Instagram DMs.If you've seen these claims on your feeds, too, you know they're often quite stark and hyperbolic. Snopes highlights one such viral Instagram post that reads, \"Every conversation. Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI.\" Users scrolling through Instagram might understandably stop to read these claims, and may, also understandably, feel concerned about their data across their various Meta accounts.The issue is, these claims are misinterpreting a real change Meta plans for its privacy policy. Once the policy updates on Dec. 16, Meta is making changes to the way it collects data from user interactions with Meta AI. Going forward, the data generated when using Meta's AI products can be used to personalize the content you see on Meta platforms, as well as the ads that are placed in your feeds. Once again, it's just more data collection in the pursuit of promoting user engagement and ad relevancy.\nPart of the confusion is in the way this privacy policy is worded. Take the following statement, a part of Meta's explanation of the user information it uses: \"Interactions with AI at Meta and related metadata. For example, information you or others exchange with AI at Meta like content and messages.\" That might sound like Meta is scraping your DMs to train its AI, but it's saying content and messages you share with Meta's AI are what's fair game. Just sending messages and attachments to users on Meta platforms doesn't end up in Meta AI's training data, but if you share those messages and attachments with the AI, then it might. Meta confirmed as much with outlets, sending the following statement: “The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn’t about DMs at all, it’s about how we’ll use people’s interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience. We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn’t new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.” Make no mistake, of course: If you're using a Meta messaging platform, the company does collect your data. In both the current and upcoming privacy policies, Meta does say messages you send and receive, including their content as well as their metadata, subject to applicable law, can be used by Meta for a number of functions. That might include personalizing Meta products to fit each user; improving Meta products in general; promoting safety and security on its platforms; storing, moving, and processing your data around the world; and processing information when the law requires.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, there are categories Meta will not use your messages for, unless you share those messages with its AI. That includes using your data for analytics and services for business; \"providing a seamless experience\" across Meta products; personalizing ads on Meta Audience Network; research and innovation for \"social good;\" anonymizing your info; and sharing data with law enforcement. In some of these cases, Meta will collect metadata about your messages—perhaps things like time or location sent—but not the message data itself. Again, this article is not meant to flatter Meta; rather, it's to debunk unnecessary concerns. Social media posts often misrepresent these nuanced privacy and security points—especially when those posts turn up the dramatics. Understand if you're using Meta products, your data is constantly being collected—but, in this case, your messages aren't suddenly being scraped to train AI.The best thing you can do to preserve your privacy and security with your Meta messages is to use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) whenever possible. WhatsApp has E2EE built-in, and Meta has automatically started rolling it out for Messenger, but you might need to manually start an E2EE chat for existing conversations in the app. The same goes for Instagram: Meta offers E2EE, but you need to enable it yourself. In either app, tap the name of the chat to check whether or not that conversation is currently E2EE.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        In the long-running Android vs. iOS competition, iPhones have historically had the edge in terms of parental controls: They've been a bit more straightforward and intuitive, and easier for caregivers to understand and manage. Apple does many things well, and getting its apps and devices working seamlessly together is definitely one of them.Google, however, is gradually improving the experience for parents, with a batch of updates earlier this year, and now some more changes as part of a significant Android 16 upgrade. The latest changes mean more controls can be accessed on your kids' devices.What's new in Android 16The usual Android caveat applies here: Each Android phone maker does things slightly differently, though there's not actually too much variation in this particular area. The latest Android 16 updates mentioned above are rolling out now to Pixel phones (and I've tested them on a Pixel), but will take a while to reach other handsets—Samsung phones will most likely get them early next year, for example, with One UI 8.5.\nSo what's new? Essentially, more of the existing parental controls are available on the Android devices of your youngsters, so you can get at them from their phones and tablets as well as accessing them remotely. It should make life easier if you're with your kids and they pass their devices over to you.You can find the options that have been added to kids' devices by opening Settings on the phone or tablet of your young person and choosing Parental controls. Right away you'll see a toggle switch for enabling on-device controls, and when you do enable them you need to enter a PIN—to stop your kid from changing these settings themselves.\n    \n            \n            The new on-device controls in Android 16.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are then four sections you can access: Daily limit, App limits, Downtime, and Website content filters. Tap on any of these to set restrictions for the current device, which can be adjusted depending on the day of the week in some cases. Pick Downtime, for example, and you can set times during which the device is locked. These match the tools you've previously been able to manage remotely.Select Daily limit, then turn on the Use daily limit toggle switch, and you're able to control how many hours your kid can use their phone or tablet for each day. There's also a bar chart showing device usage over time, so you can see how much screen time your child has been taking advantage of. These settings are simple, understandable, and a breeze to use—you don't have to mess around with Google accounts or family relationships if you don't want to. You can just enter a PIN and start making changes—you don't necessarily have to connect these settings to any other devices. If you want to manage them remotely, though, Google has a wider parental control system in place.Google's Family Link controls The new Android 16 controls that appear on devices can work independently of anything else, but Google already offers plenty of options if you need them. Everything is managed through the Google Family Link portal, which you can access on the web or through the apps on Android or iOS.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can use Google Family Link to set up Google accounts for your kids, and then manage what they're able to do with them. The idea is that they sign into their Android devices using the account you've created for them, and because Google knows you have a verified connection to them, you can put restrictions on those devices remotely.All the usual safeguards and protections are covered: You can set screen time limits, manage the apps your kids can use (and for how often), put blocks on certain websites and categories of website, and put parental approvals in place for making purchases through Google's various digital storefronts. These mostly match what's now available on-device.\n    \n            \n            Google Family Link on the web.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere's a location tracking element to Google Family Link as well, so you can see where your young people are at all times, and even get notifications based on their movements: You might want to get a ping when they turn up at school, for example, or when they leave home. All this can be managed through the apps.More recent updates let you control the amount of screen time your children can have during school hours, and there are also now tools for managing the contacts that youngsters are able to interact with—as yet you can't get to these controls directly on your kids' devices. There's plenty in the way of reports on usage too, alongside these controls.Add everything up, and Google now has a fairly comprehensive set of parental controls that you can manage from just about any device, or from the devices your kids are using—assuming you've given them Android phones or tablets. \n            ",

It's not just you: Apple Music, Apple TV, and Game Center are currently down. That's directly from Apple's \"System Status\" website, which tracks all of Apple's web-based services and identifies which ones may be experiencing problems. While most of Apple's services, like the App Store, Find My, and iMessage, are all \"Available,\" four of these services are experiencing an outage: Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple TV Channels, and Game Center.   If you click on each, you can see the service's full status report:\nApple Music - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Apple TV Channels - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Apple TV - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Game Center - 1 Outage, 1 Resolved IssueOutage: Today, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing a problem with this service. Resolved Issue: Today, 8:43 AM - 9:14 AMSome users were affectedUsers may have experienced a problem with this service.It's not clear what is causing the outages, though they all went down at 2:53 p.m.. (Apple doesn't specify, but I imagine that's ET.) This isn't the first time this has happened, of course. In fact, Apple Music was down earlier this year, though it was actually still working for me when Apple said the outage was active. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat appears to be the situation today, as well. Each report says \"some users are affected,\" not all. As it happens, Apple Music is working on my Mac, and I'm able to stream the free pilot episode of Pluribus without issue. Apple will likely get these services back up and running for affected users. In the meantime, if your Apple Music or Apple TV won't cooperate, this is likely the cause. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.  Google's virtual try on feature only needs a selfie to workWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.I'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.  \nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to upload a selfie to Google's virtual try on featureIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed. Again, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave. That, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes. As it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary. \nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

These are security flaws that are actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer releases an official patch. As reported by Bleeping Computer, this month's update addresses 56 bugs in total: 28 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, 19 remote-code-execution vulnerabilities, four information-disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial-of-service vulnerabilities, and two spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the remote code execution flaws are labeled \"critical.\" Note that these figures do not include updates released for Microsoft Edge and Mariner. Patch Tuesday is typically released on the second Tuesday of every month around 10am PT, so you can anticipate security updates at that time. \nOne of the zero-days patched in December has been actively exploited in the wild, though Microsoft has not shared any details as to how. CVE-2025-62221 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, and when exploited, give attackers SYSTEM privileges. The mini filter allows cloud applications, such as OneDrive, access to file system functions. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other two bugs fixed have been publicly disclosed: CVE-2025-64671 - GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This flaw, which can be exploited through a Cross Prompt Injection in untrusted files or MCP servers, allows attackers to execute commands locally. According to Krebs on Security, this could trick the LLM into adding malicious instructions in the user's auto-approve settings.

That isn't always the case with Apple, however. The company has a long history of removing functions from one generation of devices to the next, whether that's removing the disc drive from its MacBooks back in 2012, or taking away the iPhone's Home button in 2017. Some of these changes are good, some are controversial, while others are undone altogether: MagSafe and HDMI both found their way back to MacBooks after all.It's not often I hear about Apple removing software features from one generation of product to the next, however. So, imagine my surprise when I saw a number of headlines this morning asserting that the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple's latest and greatest flagship, is missing a feature found in the last five generations of Pro iPhones—and nobody noticed for nearly three months. Night mode is missing from Portrait mode on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The short answer? We have no idea. This was not something Apple announced publicly, of course. In fact, Macworld spotted the change in an Apple support doc: If you scroll down to the section where it says \"On supported models, you can take Night mode photos with Portrait mode,\" and click the hyperlink on \"On supported models,\" you'll pull up a list of iPhones that, mysteriously, doesn't include the 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max. The list includes:\niPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro Max For the uninitiated, Night mode and Portrait mode are technically two distinct features. Portrait mode was released first, all the way back on the iPhone 7 Plus, which utilized the dual-camera system to add a bokeh effect to shots of people. Those early shots were hit or miss, and were often no replacement for a true DSLR, but as Apple's tech and cameras have improved, so has Portrait mode. Part of the improvement was the introduction of Night mode. This feature, which Apple was a bit late to the game on, allowed you to take brighter images in low-light environments by lengthening the time the shutter stays engaged. Older iPhones without the feature would take images that were hard to see without the flash engaged, but Night mode could pull in details as long as there was just enough light present in the scene. Since the iPhone 12 Pro, Portrait mode came with the option of Night mode, as well. If you're trying to take a portrait shot in a dark environment, Night mode kicks in and gives the image a chance to turn out brighter and more detailed. But now, it seems, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max do not have this option. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, these new iPhones still have Night mode: Per that previously mentioned support page, you can take brighter shots at night when taking standard photos, selfies, and time-lapse videos. It just seems Apple decided to remove the feature for Portrait mode shots on its latest Pros.Of course, this news started breaking on Dec. 3, nearly three months after the 17 Pros launched. If it took this long for someone to notice a missing feature, was it really all that important to begin with? I don't have a 17 Pro, so I really can't say, but I also can't say I take many Portrait mode shots in dark environments. I've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this story if I hear back. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Fraudsters prey on people's fear, confusion, and desire to protect their money, which may lead targets to hand over login credentials, make irreversible wire transfers, or provide other sensitive information without stopping to question their actions. Android users in the U.S. will soon have extra protection against scams targeting their financial apps, preventing threat actors impersonating bank representatives from accessing data on their devices. Google's in-call scam protection is designed to prevent users from sharing their screens with threat actors and help them avoid revealing their banking information. How Android in-call protection worksAndroid's scam protection kicks in if you are on a phone call with a number not saved in your contacts and attempt to open a participating financial app. You'll get a pop-up warning that the call is likely a scam with a reminder not to make payments or share personal information and a button to end the call (and stop screen sharing). There's also a 30-second delay on further action on your device, which Google says is designed to disrupt any sense of urgency. \nNote that financial institutions must opt into in this feature—at this time, Google has specifically named Cash App and JPMorganChase as partners, though it indicates expansion to other popular fintechs and banks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle initially rolled out in-call protections for banking apps to UK users earlier this year as part of a larger package of security features announced ahead of Google I/O. That launch also included real-time scam detection alerts for calls and texts, improved theft protection via remote lock and identity check, key verifier for Google Messages, and device-level Advanced Protection (in addition to account-level settings). Alongside the US pilot, in-call scam protections will now cover most major banks in the UK as well as financial apps in Brazil and India. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's the hard part.You could look up the documentation for the application or explore the menu bar—but if you're on a Mac, you could also just install KeyClu. This free application shows an overlay with all the keyboard shortcuts for the currently open Mac application, which is very useful for anyone trying to become a more keyboard-savvy computer user.To get started, install the application. Then, you'll need to choose a trigger key (basically one of the modifier keys on your keyboard). By default, you will tap the key twice and hold on the second tap to trigger the overlay, but you can optionally set the application to simply press and hold the key if you prefer. I opted to press and hold Command.\nAfter that, you'll be asked to enable permissions so KeyClu can access the keyboard shortcuts for your applications. Then you can start using the application. I tend to ignore the application until I wonder whether a keyboard shortcut for a particular function exists. I trigger the application, look through the list of keyboard shortcuts, and see what's available. When I let go of the trigger key, the window disappears.This default floating window is useful, but you might want a window listing shortcuts to stay open even when you let go of the trigger. That's where the persistent panel comes in. This window, which you can trigger using the menu bar, stays open and always shows a list of keyboard shortcuts for the currently active application. You can add a separate keyboard shortcut for this window in the settings, if you like.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf you dig around in KeyClu's settings, you can configure the layout of both the pop-up and persistent panels, changing the size of the windows, how many columns shortcuts are sorted into, and which display the panels show up on.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's a simple piece of software, but it's completely free and can help you get better at using your computer.

The scheme, a recent iteration of a ClickFix attack, is designed to trick you into executing a dangerous command under the guise of completing a \"critical security update.\" But what you're actually doing is installing an infostealer that hands data over to bad actors. When a Windows update pop-up is actually a ClickFix attackClickFix is a social engineering ploy that uses tactics like fake error messages, CAPTCHA forms, and command prompts to deliver malware to your device. As PCMag reports, the Windows update scam is a pop-up that looks like a standard Windows blue screen but is actually a full screen browser page being displayed from a malicious domain. The ClickFix element is a set of keystrokes—not part of the real update interface—that have the user paste and execute a malicious command, ultimately delivering malware to their device. These instructions have an air of urgency, which is a common element of a scam. \nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Huntress have detailed the exact mechanism behind this attack, including an iteration in which users are prompted to verify they are human (rather than complete a security update). As Bleeping Computer outlines, the malicious code is embedded into the pixel data of PNG images, and the final payload is one of two known infostealers.According to the Huntress analysis, following a recent law enforcement operation, fake Windows update pages continue to exist across multiple domains, but those domains no longer seem to host the malware payload. That doesn't mean, however, that this attack, or some version of it, won't pop up elsewhere. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to stay safe from this ClickFix attackIf you run Windows on your device, you've probably seen a blue or black update or error screen many times, and you may not be suspicious if your computer randomly begins an update or prompts you to take an extra step to confirm it. But while a legitimate update screen will have a progress indicator and instructions not to turn off your computer, you should never need to input manual commands. This is a red flag of a ClickFix attack and not something a trusted service will require.  Of course, it's important to keep your computer up to date. Microsoft releases security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, known as Patch Tuesday, and you can enable automatic updates on your machine to ensure you get fixes as soon as they're available. If you want to take additional steps to prevent ClickFix attacks on Windows, you can disable the Windows Run box to prevent unauthorized access to commands.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.  OpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks. But most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models? \nHow GPT-5.2 performs in ChatGPTOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.GPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.GPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models. GPT-5.2's safety policyOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide. Actively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.OpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.

The third (and newest) generation comes with OTA updates that the AirPods Pro 2 also got to enjoy—but considering the second and third generations are the same price right now, why not go with the newer version? If you want the latest Apple has to offer, this is a great time to do so. The AirPods Pro 3 are down to $199 (originally $249.99) for the first time since their September release—the lowest price yet, according to price tracking tools.\nThe AirPods Pro 3 improve on already great premium earbuds with new features (like a heart rate sensor) without increasing the list price. You'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" (this also works for answering or denying calls). Apple added a live translation feature to both the second- and third-generation AirPods Pro when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year. You'll also get features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSince these are in-ear earbuds (as supposed to regular earbuds like the AirPods 4) the ANC is much better since it naturally blocks out the noise with a tight seal, but the ANC technology itself has also improved—as has the sound quality, thanks to the new H3 chip, as PCMag detailed in its \"exemplary\" review. You can expect about eight hours of juice, depending on your usage, and another 24 hours from the charging case. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

While there are plenty of AI video generators out there producing this stuff, one of the most prevalent is OpenAI's Sora, which is particularly adept at generating realistic short-form videos mimicking the content you might find on TikTok or Instagram Reels. These videos can be so convincing at first glance, that people often don't realize what they're seeing is 100% fake. That can be harmless when it's videos of cats playing instruments at midnight, but dangerous when impersonating real people or properties. It's that last point that I thought would offer some pushback to AI's seemingly exponential growth. These companies have trained their AI models on huge amounts of data, much of which is copyrighted, which means that people are able to generate images and videos of iconic characters like Pikachu, Superman, and Darth Vader. The big AI generators put guardrails on their platforms to try to prevent videos that infringe on copyright, but people find a way around them. As such, corporations have already started suing OpenAI, Google, and other AI companies over this blatant IP theft. (Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)Disney is handing its characters over to Sora users  But it seems not all companies want to go down this path. Take Disney, as a prime example. On Thursday, OpenAI announced that it had made a three-year licensing agreement with the company behind Mickey Mouse. As part of the deal, Sora users can now generate videos featuring over 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters. The announcement names the following characters and movies specifically:\nMickey MouseMinnie MouseLiloStitch ArielBelleBeastCinderellaBaymaxSimbaMufasaBlack PantherCaptain AmericaDeadpoolGrootIron ManLokiThorThanosDarth VaderHan SoloLuke SkywalkerLeiaThe MandalorianStormtroopersYodaEncantoFrozenInside OutMoanaMonsters Inc.Toy StoryUp ZootopiaThat includes licensed costumes, props, vehicles, and environments. What's more, Disney+ will host a \"selection\" of these \"fan-inspired\" Sora videos. (I'll admit, that last point genuinely shocks me.) This does only apply to Disney's visual assets, however, as Sora users won't have access to voice acting. ChatGPT users will also be able to generate images with these characters, so this news doesn't just affect Sora users.You might think OpenAI is paying Disney a hefty licensing fee here, but it appears to be quite the opposite. Not only is Disney pledging to use OpenAI APIs to build \"products, tools, and experiences,\" it is rolling out ChatGPT to its employees as well. Oh, and the company is making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI. (Is that all?)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI know many companies are embracing AI, often in ways I disagree with. But this deal is something else entirely. I'm not sure any Disney executives actually searched for \"Sora Disney\" on the internet, because right now, you'll find fake AI trailers for Pixar movies filled with racism, sexual content, and generally offensive content—all generated using an app Disney just licensed all of its properties to. OpenAI asserts in its announcement that both companies are committed to preventing \"illegal or harmful\" content on the platform, but Sora users are already creating harmful content. What kind of content can we expect with carte blanch access to Disney's properties?Now that Disney's characters are fair game, I can't imagine the absolute slop that some users are going to make here. The only hope I have is in the fact that Disney+ is going to host some of these videos. Staff will have to weed through some garbage to find videos that are actually suitable for the platform. And maybe seeing the \"content\" that Sora users like to make with iconic characters will be enough for Disney to rethink its plans.     \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Generative AI tools continue to improve in terms of their photo editing capabilities, and OpenAI's latest upgrade brings Adobe Photoshop right inside your ChatGPT app window (alongside Adobe Acrobat for handling PDFs, and Adobe Express for graphic design). It's available to everyone, for free—you just need a ChatGPT account and an Adobe account.As per Adobe, the idea is to make \"creativity accessible for everyone\" by plugging Photoshop tools directly into ChatGPT. The desktop version of Photoshop already comes with plenty of generative AI features of its own, so this is AI layered on top of more AI—but is it actually useful?How to get started with Photoshop inside ChatGPTAdobe Photoshop, Adobe Express and Adobe Acrobat are available now inside ChatGPT on the desktop, on the web, and on iOS. At the time of writing, you can also get Adobe Express inside ChatGPT for Android, with Photoshop and Acrobat \"coming soon.\" To weigh the capabilities of the new integration, I tested it in a desktop web browser.\nTo get started, all you need to do is type \"Photoshop\" at the start of your prompt: ChatGPT should recognize what you're trying to do, and select Adobe Photoshop as the tool to use for the next prompt. You'll also need to click through a couple of confirmation dialog boxes, and connect an Adobe account (if you don't have one, you can make one for free).\n    \n            \n            You'll need to connect ChatGPT to your Adobe account.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWith all the connections and logins completed, Photoshop is then added to the overflow menu in the prompt box, so just click on the + (plus) to select it. You can start describing what you want to happen using the same natural, conversational language you'd use for any other ChatGPT prompt. You do need to also upload an image or provide a public link to one—if you don't do this before you submit your prompt, you'll be asked to do it after.You don't need to know the names of all the Photoshop tools: Just describe what you want to happen and the relevant tools will be selected for you. One example Adobe gives is using the prompt \"make my image pop,\" which brings up the Bloom, Grain, and Lens Distortion effects—and each one can be adjusted via sliders on screen. It's actually quite simple to use.\n    \n            \n            Simple adjustments can be made with on-screen sliders.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you do know the name of the tools you want, you can call them up by name, and the classic brightness and contrast sliders are a good place to start. You can either say something like \"make the picture brighter\" or \"adjust the image brightness\"—both will bring up an overlay you can use to make brightness adjustments, but if you use the former prompt, the image will already have been made a little brighter.ChatGPT and Photoshop let you add edit upon edit as needed, and you can save the image at any stage. There's also the option to open your processed file in the Photoshop web app whenever you like: This web app uses a freemium model, with advanced features requiring a subscription, and seems to be what the ChatGPT integration is largely based on.What you can do with Adobe in ChatGPTAdobe offers a handy ChatGPT prompts cheat sheet you can browse through, which gives you a good idea of what's possible, and what you're still going to need Photoshop proper for. Note that you can specify certain parts of the image to focus on (like \"the face\" or \"the car\") but this depends on Photoshop-in-ChatGPT being able to correctly figure out where you want your selection to be. It needs to be pretty obvious and well delineated.When I tried cutting out objects and removing backgrounds, this worked well—but then I had to turn to Photoshop on the web to actually drop in a different background. There's no way to work with layers or masks here, and you can't remove people or objects from photos, either. Sometimes, however, you do get a spool of \"thinking\" from ChatGPT about how it can't do what the user is asking for.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Cut-outs are one of the tricks you can do.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI was able to apply some nice colorizations here, via prompts like \"turn all the hues in this image to blue,\" and I like the way ChatGPT will give you further instructions on how to get the effect you want. You can even say \"show some examples\" and it gives you a few presets to choose from—all of which can be adjusted via the sliders again. The ability to run prompts like \"turn this into an oil painting\" or \"turn this into a cartoon\" are useful too, though the plug-in is limited by the effects available in Photoshop for the web: You'll be directed to the closest effect and advised how to tweak it to get the look you want. Actually, some of these effects work better in ChatGPT's native image editor, which maybe explains why Adobe wanted to get involved here.\n    \n            \n            ChatGPT removed someone from this picture, no Photoshop required.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf ChatGPT's image manipulation gets good enough, then Photoshop is no longer going to be needed by a substantial number of users: ChatGPT can already remove people and objects from photos, for example, quite effectively. What it's not quite as good at is some of the basic adjustments (like colors and contrast) that Adobe software has been managing for years.For quick, basic edits you want to type out in natural language—especially where you want to adjust the edits manually and need advice on what to do next—Photoshop inside ChatGPT is a handy tool to be able to turn to, especially as it's free. For serious edits, though, you're still going to want to fire up the main Photoshop app, or maybe even shun Adobe altogether and make use of ChatGPT's steadily improving editing tools.\n            ",

Beginning Feb. 1, 2026, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start collecting a $45 fee from travelers using non-compliant forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. The agency previously proposed a fee of $18 to cover the administrative and IT costs of ID verification for those traveling without a REAL ID or passport but increased the total to $45 in an announcement released earlier this month. REAL ID requirementsThe 2005 REAL ID Act mandated the standardization of state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards. After multiple delays since 2008, the Department of Homeland Security earlier this year finally began requiring anyone age 18 and over to have a REAL ID-compliant license to clear airport security or enter certain federal buildings. \nTravelers can also comply with the regulations using a U.S. passport, U.S. passport card, DHS Trusted Traveler card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver's License (from Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, of Washington). Enhanced Tribal Cards, permanent resident and border crossing cards, Department of Defense IDs, and foreign passports are also accepted. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can still travel without a REAL IDThe vast majority of Americans—94 percent—already have a REAL ID or another accepted form of identification. Those who don't will have to complete an online verification process and pay the $45 fee before they are able to clear airport security. Travelers are being encouraged to do this in advance: If you arrive without approval, you'll be sent out of line to complete the process (which can take up to 30 minutes) before being allowed through. The $45 fee covers security checkpoint access for up to 10 days, after which you'll have to repeat the process and payment. Travelers whose REAL ID or passport has been lost or stolen also have to pay. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

An RC, as the name implies, is the version of a software update Apple intends to release to the general public. Before it rolls out, though, Apple sends the update out to beta testers to see if there are any bugs or glitches that need addressing. If not, these are the updates that will hit your Apple devices sometime this month. That includes watchOS 26.2, Apple's latest OS for its line of smartwatches. While there aren't nearly as many new features and changes in this update as there were in watchOS 26 proper, there are still some key things to highlight in this RC. In fact, as noted by 9to5Mac, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  \nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. Going forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.Music app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 RC that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. When does watchOS 26.2 come out?Apple doesn't have a set date for watchOS 26.2, or iOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2 for that matter. However, now that the RCs are out, these updates are likely coming soon. As long as there aren't any glaring bugs or glitches in these RCs, Apple will likely ship the updates sometime this month.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        In the long-running Android vs. iOS competition, iPhones have historically had the edge in terms of parental controls: They've been a bit more straightforward and intuitive, and easier for caregivers to understand and manage. Apple does many things well, and getting its apps and devices working seamlessly together is definitely one of them.Google, however, is gradually improving the experience for parents, with a batch of updates earlier this year, and now some more changes as part of a significant Android 16 upgrade. The latest changes mean more controls can be accessed on your kids' devices.What's new in Android 16The usual Android caveat applies here: Each Android phone maker does things slightly differently, though there's not actually too much variation in this particular area. The latest Android 16 updates mentioned above are rolling out now to Pixel phones (and I've tested them on a Pixel), but will take a while to reach other handsets—Samsung phones will most likely get them early next year, for example, with One UI 8.5.\nSo what's new? Essentially, more of the existing parental controls are available on the Android devices of your youngsters, so you can get at them from their phones and tablets as well as accessing them remotely. It should make life easier if you're with your kids and they pass their devices over to you.You can find the options that have been added to kids' devices by opening Settings on the phone or tablet of your young person and choosing Parental controls. Right away you'll see a toggle switch for enabling on-device controls, and when you do enable them you need to enter a PIN—to stop your kid from changing these settings themselves.\n    \n            \n            The new on-device controls in Android 16.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are then four sections you can access: Daily limit, App limits, Downtime, and Website content filters. Tap on any of these to set restrictions for the current device, which can be adjusted depending on the day of the week in some cases. Pick Downtime, for example, and you can set times during which the device is locked. These match the tools you've previously been able to manage remotely.Select Daily limit, then turn on the Use daily limit toggle switch, and you're able to control how many hours your kid can use their phone or tablet for each day. There's also a bar chart showing device usage over time, so you can see how much screen time your child has been taking advantage of. These settings are simple, understandable, and a breeze to use—you don't have to mess around with Google accounts or family relationships if you don't want to. You can just enter a PIN and start making changes—you don't necessarily have to connect these settings to any other devices. If you want to manage them remotely, though, Google has a wider parental control system in place.Google's Family Link controls The new Android 16 controls that appear on devices can work independently of anything else, but Google already offers plenty of options if you need them. Everything is managed through the Google Family Link portal, which you can access on the web or through the apps on Android or iOS.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can use Google Family Link to set up Google accounts for your kids, and then manage what they're able to do with them. The idea is that they sign into their Android devices using the account you've created for them, and because Google knows you have a verified connection to them, you can put restrictions on those devices remotely.All the usual safeguards and protections are covered: You can set screen time limits, manage the apps your kids can use (and for how often), put blocks on certain websites and categories of website, and put parental approvals in place for making purchases through Google's various digital storefronts. These mostly match what's now available on-device.\n    \n            \n            Google Family Link on the web.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere's a location tracking element to Google Family Link as well, so you can see where your young people are at all times, and even get notifications based on their movements: You might want to get a ping when they turn up at school, for example, or when they leave home. All this can be managed through the apps.More recent updates let you control the amount of screen time your children can have during school hours, and there are also now tools for managing the contacts that youngsters are able to interact with—as yet you can't get to these controls directly on your kids' devices. There's plenty in the way of reports on usage too, alongside these controls.Add everything up, and Google now has a fairly comprehensive set of parental controls that you can manage from just about any device, or from the devices your kids are using—assuming you've given them Android phones or tablets. \n            ",

I discovered the issue myself just after 9:30 a.m. ET. I was scrolling on my feed, when all of a sudden, new posts wouldn't load, and I was greeted by an option to refresh. When I did, the site reloaded, but now without any posts—only the futile option to try reloading again.You can see a steep spike in user reports on Downdetector (which, for full disclosure, is owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis). At the time of writing, roughly 25,000 users had reported issues with X, I among them. There are a number of potential reasons why X won't load this morning, but it doesn't appear to be a larger issue with a cloud hosting service. Anytime a major website like X goes down, it harkens back to global outages, stemming from issues with cloud hosting services like AWS and Cloudflare. However, a quick check on Downdetector shows me that few other sites and services are having massive outage reports at the moment. That could change, but as of this article, it seems like X's issues are their own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nX will no doubt get things back up and running soon.

I love stock Android, and I'm always running the latest Android beta, making Pixel basically my only choice. But there are times when I get jealous looking at all the extra tools that Samsung provides on its Galaxy phones, Edge Panel being the big one. With Edge Panel, you can swipe in from the edge of your phone and a hidden drawer reveals itself, filled with apps, system actions, and shortcuts. Given how barebones Pixel Launcher is, I've always wanted something like this. Then I found the Panels app by Fossor Coding (not to be confused with the ill-fated wallpaper app by MKBHD).In some ways, Panels is even better than Edge Panels on Samsung. It lets you use custom icon packs, there's a quick search shortcut, and you can even open floating widgets. Plus, because it's customizable, you can move the trigger point to the bottom edge of your phone instead of the side (incredibly handy for large phones), and you can add multiple columns (up to a ridiculous seven column layout). And while you can pay for Panels, all of that basic functionality is included for free.How to customize the Panels app for AndroidFirst, install the app and give it permission to display over other apps; this makes sure that the Panels launcher can work when you're using any app.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNext, tap on the View button and customize the panel. The free version limits you to 3 columns and 9 rows, which seems like plenty to me. You can upgrade to the full version to remove this limit (which is quite cheap, at just $1.50). From the Trigger section, you can customize the trigger area. If you have a larger phone, I highly recommend bringing down the trigger area towards the bottom of the screen.Now, let's customize the Panels launcher itself. Swipe in from your trigger area and hold for a second to bring up the sidebar panel. By default, you'll see some apps here already. Tap and hold on an empty area to start adding more apps.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nYou can choose to add any of the following items:Applications: Choose any installed app. Add your most frequently used apps here.Shortcuts: Launch actions from inside any supported apps. For example, you can create a shortcut for adding a new task in TickTick, or messaging someone on WhatsApp.App pair: Create shortcuts for launching two apps side-by-side, made even more useful after Android 16's latest 90:10 split screen update.Accessibility: Add shortcuts for system-level options like Home, Back, Notifications, Screenshot, and more.System preferences: Quick access to frequently used settings like media volume, cellular data, airplane mode, Wi-Fi, and a lot more.Website: You can add any website as a quick shortcut here.Floating widget: This is a hidden gem. You can add widgets that open in a floating window above everything else. You can trigger widgets for news, weather, or sports updates. They can hover over everything else for a few seconds, before you dismiss them out of the way.Folder: If you have too many quick app options, organize them in folders instead.Contact: Add any contact here as an icon. Press and hold to quickly call, message, or email them.Quick Search: Another useful hack. The Quick Search panel brings up a fast search for all installed apps.Go over each option and choose what you'd like to add to your sidebar launcher. Me, I'm a simple man, so my focus is mostly on my most frequently used apps, shortcuts for common actions, and quick access to some system level functionality.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOne swipe gesture: Lastly, here's a pro tip. While you can open apps in Panels by swiping, lifting your thumb, and selecting, you can also do it without taking your thumb off the screen.Once you swipe in from the edge and the Panels sidebar opens up, don't let go. You can keep moving your thumb to highlight any app or shortcut (the icon that's in focus will get bigger). Then simply let go over your selection to launch it. Overall, Panels is a pretty robust app. Once you have your personalized setup, you can launch apps, shortcuts, or widgets, with just a swipe, no matter which app you're using.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you enter your debit or credit card into one of these fake card readers, your data is stored for later download or transmitted wirelessly in real time to a device controlled by scammers, who will use the information to steal from your accounts. Unfortunately, online shoppers aren't immune from this scheme. Web skimming is a type of cyberattack that uses malicious code to steal card data during checkout, and researchers have identified an ongoing campaign targeting major payment providers and, by extension, consumers. Online credit card skimmingWeb skimming attacks, broadly referred to as \"Magecart\" campaigns, are initiated when malicious JavaScript is injected into e-commerce websites and payment portals. When a checkout page loads, the skimmer replaces it with a spoofed form that collects card numbers, expiry dates, card verification codes, and billing or shipping addresses—everything threat actors need to turn around and use your card for fraudulent purchases. \nThe fake payment forms use legitimate-looking branding and styling to minimize suspicion. Once payment details are transmitted to the attacker, the user gets an error message and is redirected to the real checkout page, a flow designed to make you believe that you've simply entered your information incorrectly. Web skimmers are typically designed to avoid detection and may even self-destruct, making them difficult to identify even for site admins. They also utilize bulletproof hosting, which shields cyber actors from takedown requests and law enforcement action. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect your payment cardUnfortunately, consumers can't do much about the presence of web skimmers, but they can play defense against them. Red flags of an online shopping scam are also red flags for skimming—for example, deals and discounts that are too good to be true are indicators of a possible fraudulent vendor or malicious site, where you may be more likely to have your card details stolen. Shopping with reputable vendors will reduce (though not entirely eliminate) the risk. You should also be vigilant about any unusual steps during checkout, such as redirects or error messages, and abandon any suspicious transactions. If you suspect that your payment details may have been stolen, keep an eye on your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized activity, and enable transaction alerts for real-time updates. Remember that credit cards offer more security protections than debit cards. You could also use virtual cards for online purchases, which allows you to keep your actual card details private and protect you from further fraud. (Note, however, that virtual cards have some drawbacks. For example, you may lose some protections offered by your primary card provider and have a tougher time obtaining refunds.)\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There are exceptions for third-party addresses, like work emails tied to a company's domain, but for the typical @gmail.com account, no dice. Personally, I've had a number of loyalty programs and store accounts tied to an embarrassingly edgy email from high school for decades now, but finally, it seems like I'll be able to change it.A recently updated Google support page says the company is now \"gradually rolling out\" the ability to change your Gmail address, with some limitations. Oddly, the page was only available in Hindi when it was first posted in late December, and I did not hear back when I reached out to Google for clarification about where and when the feature will be available. The support page did say (through a machine translation) that the feature's coming \"to all users,\" but now, it's finally been officially posted in English.When the support page was first updated, I checked if I could change any of my personal Gmail addresses, but no luck. Now that it's in English, I checked again, but I still seem unable to make the change. But the addition of English to the company's messaging does imply that the feature will make its way to English-speaking territories soon, if it's not rolling out already. I've reached out to Google for confirmation on this, but did not immediately hear back.\nOnce the feature rolls out to you, here's how you'll be able to change your Gmail address.On a computer or mobile device, navigate to myaccount.google.com/google-account-email.At the top of the page, click or tap Personal Info. Under Email, Click or Tap on Google Account Email.From there, click or tap on Change Google Account Email and enter your updated email address.Note that while these are the official English instructions, they match the original instructions provided in Hindi.There are a couple of wrinkles to changing your Gmail address, however. The big one is that emails sent to your old address will still be sent to your new one, and that your old email may still show up instead of your new one in some cases, like on Calendar events created before you changed your address. That's because your former name will be listed as an alias for the account, rather than deleted. That could be a pain if you're trying to leave old contacts behind, but it'll also ensure important contacts don't get lost in the shuffle, and it'll keep anyone else from registering a new account with that email address. You'll also still be able to use your old Gmail address to sign into any accounts associated with it, and regardless of which name you sign in with, you'll still have access to all of your messages, photos, and other files. You can also revert to your old address at any time, but as for changing it to a new address, you can only do it once a year, and only three times total. So no changing it to a wacky new address every Halloween and then back to normal come November.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle also warns that changing your Gmail address will require Chromebook users to remove their old account from their device, and then re-add it with the new email address. Chrome Remote Desktop users will also need to follow these steps. Using \"Sign in With Google\" on third-party sites could also pose issues for those who don't want to sign in with their old Gmail address, although Google has a number of fixes that you can try, with varying guarantees of success.Still, it should be a major quality-of-life upgrade, and should help Google's email service better catch up to more permissive email providers like Proton. No more sounding like an edgelord every time I talk to the checkout clerk at Sephora.Update 1/15/2026: Updated with official English instructions for changing your Gmail address.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I've had my JBL Charge 3 for years, and it's still thumping powerful beats just like when I first got it. If you get a chance to buy an older JBL speaker at a discount, you can rest assured you're getting a quality product at a good price—and that's what Woot is offering right now. You can currently pick up a new JBL Flip 6 at a 46% discount, bringing it to $69.95 (originally $129.95), the lowest price it has ever reached according to price tracking tools.\nThe JBL Flip 6 has been around since 2021 and was succeeded in 2025 by the JBL Flip 7; hence the massive discount you're seeing right now. Like all portable JBL speakers, the Flip 6 produces powerful sound, with a booming bass sound signature. If you don't like how it sounds out of the box, you can tweak it with the JBL companion app, the best audio app I've tested (and I've tested many). It's user-friendly, has many practical features like a full EQ adjustable setting, and it allows you to connect to other JBL speakers with Aurocast.This is a rugged outdoor speaker with an IP67 rating, meaning it's water- and dust-proof, so you can take it with you on any outdoor adventure. It will deliver about 12 hours of battery, rechargeable via USB-C, but that number will vary depending on how loud you play it. There is no speakerphone or AUX connection, and it's a mono channel unless you hook it up to other JBL speakers. It supports AAC and SBC codecs, but not AptX. You can learn more about it on PCMag's 4.0 \"excellent\" review.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou won't find a better speaker under $70 with as good a reputation or as strong a companion app. If you're looking for a portable speaker with powerful bass at a great discount, the JBL Flip 6 is a great buy.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments. The scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic). \nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers. A nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBetterment data hackedCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. If you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.If you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look. \n\n    \n            \n            There are plenty of categories to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.The home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to sign up for a MediaWiki account if you want to be able to contribute to the site too.Hover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.Click through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Each movie comes with a cast list.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.Obviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.Free movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That was due to Verizon's nationwide outage, which affected roughly two million customers across the United States. If you were among them, you couldn't use your phone on the go, which is sort of the idea behind cellphones in general. This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send work emails or messages, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or perhaps because of it), the company seems keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced it had resolved the outage, it also said it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowVerizon made a post on X, once again apologizing for the outage and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive. If you're among them, Verizon says they will text you when the credit is available. When it is, you can log into the myVerizon app to claim your recompense.        \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It marks a middle ground between the Free and Plus plans, coming in at $8/month vs. the Plus plan's $20/month, and is arguably the first \"affordable\" ChatGPT subscription.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nWhat you get is basically an expanded version of the Free tier, as it does not give you access to any new models or features, but does put a higher limit on messages, uploads, images, and memory. It also gives you unlimited access to ChatGPT's new 5.2 model, as opposed to the limited usage that comes with the Free tier. \nEssentially, it's aimed at everyday users who just need a little bit more from the AI, but don't necessarily want more power user-oriented features like advanced reasoning models or Sora video generation.However, with that price cut over the Plus plan comes a double-edged sword. Announced alongside ChatGPT Go were ads, which OpenAI said it's planning to start testing in the U.S. for the Free and Go tiers \"in the coming weeks.\" We've seen hints that ads would be coming to ChatGPT for a while, but now we know roughly what they'll look like.OpenAI says that ChatGPT ads will be clearly labeled, will show up below answers, and will focus on products that are relevant to whatever conversation you're having. The company promises that ads won't influence your answers and that your ChatGPT conversations will be kept private from advertisers, but that your ads will be personalized over time. However, you'll be able to turn off ad personalization and clear the data used for it at any time.Oddly enough, for this initial testing phase, OpenAI also says ads will only apply to users who are logged in, meaning that if you're planning to use the Free tier anyway, you might be able to skirt them for now by just staying logged out. You'll lose out on features like memory, but it might be worth it depending on your priorities. ChatGPT Go users will have no choice but to see ads, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nAlongside the announcement, OpenAI posted a few examples of what ads would look like in the app, but nothing is final yet. Of note, ads will not run on accounts where the user either admits to being under 18, or the company predicts they are. Similarly, sensitive topics like health or politics should remain ad-free.Both of today's announcements point to ways AI is trying to become profitable in 2026, which has continually proven to be challenging for the companies operating these chatbots, despite heavy investment. Unsurprisingly, they rely on the same methods pre-AI companies have relied on for decades: Ads and subscriptions. But for now, OpenAI is making at least two promises it's hoping will help the news go down more easily.First, the company says it will \"always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that's ad-free.\" That's probably cold comfort to anyone who values their wallet. But second, and perhaps most surprising if true, is that OpenAI still says it's not going to optimize for \"time spent in ChatGPT\" over \"user trust and experience.\" That'll be a boon for usability, but less time spent in-app will mean serving fewer ads. I'm curious to see how long OpenAI will stick to that commitment, especially as monetary incentives push the company in the other direction.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Big-budget titles, console-quality ports, and cloud streaming have turned phones into credible gaming machines. The problem is still input. Touch controls work until they don’t, especially once games demand precise movement, aiming, or long sessions. The Razer Kishi Ultra is built to fix that gap. And it’s currently $79.99 on Amazon, which online price trackers confirm is its lowest price to date. It fits most phones, even with cases, and can expand wide enough to hold an iPad mini, which gives it more range than controllers built only for phones.\nIn use, the Kishi Ultra feels closer to a traditional console controller than a typical snap-on accessory. It’s large and deliberately so, with thick grips that distribute the weight of your phone instead of cramping your hands. The triggers use Hall Effect sensors, which provide smoother movement and more consistent input than standard triggers, especially noticeable in racing games and shooters where partial pulls matter. The face buttons are mechanical and clicky, and the eight-way D-pad handles precise inputs well for fighting games and older titles. Razer also includes two extra programmable bumpers that can be mapped through its app, which helps in games that benefit from quick-access controls.That said, there are some trade-offs worth noting. The controller connects over USB-C, so it won’t work with older iPhones that still rely on Lightning. The wired connection does bring one upside: You can plug it into a PC and use it like a standard controller, which adds value if you move between platforms. On iOS, cloud gaming support can feel inconsistent with services like Xbox Game Pass, while Android tends to be smoother overall, notes this PCMag review. Still, if you want mobile gaming to feel closer to a console session, the Kishi Ultra makes a convincing case at this price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Razer Kishi Ultra is a full-size mobile gaming controller that brings console-style controls to phones and tablets. It’s now $79.99 on Amazon, the lowest price it has hit so far, making it easier to justify if you want more precise controls for mobile or cloud gaming.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I grew up in the era of headphones, and never quite liked the idea of sticking something into my ears on the regular. If that sounds like you, Sony's got your back. Its newest earbuds, the Linkbuds Clip, are clip-ons.Sony's not the first brand to take this idea to market—Anker's Soundcore brand has a number of more affordable options. But for premium clip-on earbuds, it's pretty much this, the slightly more expensive Bose, and the slightly sportier Shokz.Compared to that competition, Sony's new model is looking like a solid choice. These earbuds fit snugly around your ear with an adjustable ear cushion, and include the niceties that Sony's Linkbuds have become known for. That means an optional built-in voice boost mode to help you hear vocals better; adaptive audio that can raise or lower your volume based on your environment; a motion sensor for tapping gestures (which you can actually perform near your ear instead of on the earbuds themselves); and—new with this model—a bone-conduction sensor.\nSony's pitching that last bit as being especially good for calls, as the bone conduction sensor will be able to detect specifically when you are speaking, and, working alongside some \"AI noise reduction,\" should be able to reduce background noise.Battery life has also been improved over Sony's last Linkbuds, the Linkbuds Open. There, you got 22 hours of battery life with the case, but here, Sony is promising up to 37. The buds themselves should provide up to nine hours of battery life.Speaking of the Linkbuds Open, that model also had a unique design, as the bulk of the earbud was designed to sit in your upper ear, while a ring that actually produced the sound sat just outside your ear canal. It was a design that aimed for an experience akin to \"open-back\" headphones, meaning you'd be able to completely hear your surroundings with the earbuds in without needing a transparency mode. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sony\n                    \n    \nThe Linkbuds Clip want to keep that same open-back experience, while allowing for greater comfort and flexibility. Sony told me that the Linkbuds Open do sit closer to the eardrum if worn correctly, which can provide a better listening experience, but that differing ear shapes made it hard for some customers to use as intended. I was sent a pair of Linkbuds Clip for review, and while I haven't had much time to test them yet, I can confirm that they fit pretty snugly on my ears right out of the box.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOver the next week, I'm excited to try the Linkbuds Clip both while out and about in New York City, and while exercising. Aside from enhanced comfort over in-ear earbuds, you'll be fully aware of your surroundings while wearing these, which should help with safety or any spur-of-the-moment conversations you might need to have (Sony is also marketing these towards parents who might need to constantly keep an ear out for their kids). I also sometimes feel like my in-ear earbuds can block airflow while I'm doing cardio, which I worry makes it harder for me to cool off, so I'm curious to see if these can help with that.The one downside is that, as is the case with open-back headphones, there can be some sound leakage, which means others might be able to hear whatever you're listening to. That's something I'll need to test over time, although Sony does say it has an optional sound leakage reduction mode.There's also no noise canceling, but that's to be expected when the idea is to stay aware of your surroundings.I've been a big fan of Sony's audio products over the years, especially its software and listening modes. My full review of the Linkbuds Clip will be coming soon, but if you're already convinced, you can snag your own pair for $230 over at Sony's website, or through stores like Amazon. The case comes in four colors, but you can also grab a silicone case cover, which covers half of the case, to help you mix and match over on Sony's website for $12.50. Extra air cushions of any color are also available alongside upper case covers, while bottom case covers come with a keychain.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

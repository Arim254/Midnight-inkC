For example, threat actors are generating real Apple support tickets to phish two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and gain access to iCloud accounts. The scheme, detailed on Medium by a security researcher and software product manager Eric Moret, shows how social engineering tactics can sow just enough fear and confusion to trick even those who know the red flags. (The money transfer scam that conned a financial advice columnist out of $50,000 is another example.) How scammers are exploiting Apple's support systemThe Apple support scam started with a text message from Apple containing a 2FA code, followed by verification notifications across devices, indicating that someone was trying to log into Moret's account. He then received an automated call from Apple with another 2FA code. The text was delivered from a five-digit short code, and the call from a toll-free number, both of which are used by legitimate businesses and not necessarily red flags of a scam.\nThe next call, however, came from an Atlanta-based 404 phone number. The caller claimed to be from Apple Support, stated that Moret's account was under attack, and assured him that they were opening up a support ticket. During a follow-up call lasting 25 minutes, Moret received a real Apple Support case confirmation via email (it turns out anyone can create an Apple support ticket in someone else's name) and was directed to reset his iCloud password. He was then sent a link via text—from the 404 number this time—to close the ticket. After clicking through, Moret was directed to a phishing website that spoofed a real Apple page (the URL was appeal-apple[dot]com), where he was prompted to enter a 6-digit 2FA code he'd just received via text. An email to his inbox then alerted him that an unknown Mac mini had been used to sign into his iCloud account, which the rep on the phone told him was \"expected as part of the security process\" and \"standard procedure.\" Moret then immediately reset his iCloud password again to kick the unauthorized device off.  It may be easy in hindsight to see the signs: the unsolicited call about an urgent security issue, the 404 number, the phishing link that isn't a real Apple subdomain, the request for an authentication code. But the Apple support ticket—with a real case number and official emails from apple.com domains—lent just enough credibility, and the multiple 2FA notifications just enough urgency, to work.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's the problem with social engineering. It manipulates emotions and instincts that are stronger than logic and reason, leading to actions that are not in our interest. How to stay safe As always, you should be wary of anyone who calls, texts, or emails you about a security or account issue, even if you have received real security alerts or they have a legitimate case number. Don't click links, enter credentials, or provide codes when prompted by these unsolicited callers. Don't accept reassurance from anyone on the phone, no matter how calm and confident they sound. If you are concerned, you should reach out directly using trusted contact information or open support tickets yourself. Always check URLs and subdomains carefully, as hackers can play tricks to make them look legit. Also, know that simply having 2FA enabled isn't enough to keep your accounts secure. Some forms are (obviously) easily phished, so if possible, you should use a multi-factor authentication method like a hardware key or WebAuthn credentials (biometrics and passkeys) rather than codes. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The scheme, a recent iteration of a ClickFix attack, is designed to trick you into executing a dangerous command under the guise of completing a \"critical security update.\" But what you're actually doing is installing an infostealer that hands data over to bad actors. When a Windows update pop-up is actually a ClickFix attackClickFix is a social engineering ploy that uses tactics like fake error messages, CAPTCHA forms, and command prompts to deliver malware to your device. As PCMag reports, the Windows update scam is a pop-up that looks like a standard Windows blue screen but is actually a full screen browser page being displayed from a malicious domain. The ClickFix element is a set of keystrokes—not part of the real update interface—that have the user paste and execute a malicious command, ultimately delivering malware to their device. These instructions have an air of urgency, which is a common element of a scam. \nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Huntress have detailed the exact mechanism behind this attack, including an iteration in which users are prompted to verify they are human (rather than complete a security update). As Bleeping Computer outlines, the malicious code is embedded into the pixel data of PNG images, and the final payload is one of two known infostealers.According to the Huntress analysis, following a recent law enforcement operation, fake Windows update pages continue to exist across multiple domains, but those domains no longer seem to host the malware payload. That doesn't mean, however, that this attack, or some version of it, won't pop up elsewhere. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to stay safe from this ClickFix attackIf you run Windows on your device, you've probably seen a blue or black update or error screen many times, and you may not be suspicious if your computer randomly begins an update or prompts you to take an extra step to confirm it. But while a legitimate update screen will have a progress indicator and instructions not to turn off your computer, you should never need to input manual commands. This is a red flag of a ClickFix attack and not something a trusted service will require.  Of course, it's important to keep your computer up to date. Microsoft releases security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, known as Patch Tuesday, and you can enable automatic updates on your machine to ensure you get fixes as soon as they're available. If you want to take additional steps to prevent ClickFix attacks on Windows, you can disable the Windows Run box to prevent unauthorized access to commands.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That isn't always the case with Apple, however. The company has a long history of removing functions from one generation of devices to the next, whether that's removing the disc drive from its MacBooks back in 2012, or taking away the iPhone's Home button in 2017. Some of these changes are good, some are controversial, while others are undone altogether: MagSafe and HDMI both found their way back to MacBooks after all.It's not often I hear about Apple removing software features from one generation of product to the next, however. So, imagine my surprise when I saw a number of headlines this morning asserting that the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple's latest and greatest flagship, is missing a feature found in the last five generations of Pro iPhones—and nobody noticed for nearly three months. Night mode is missing from Portrait mode on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The short answer? We have no idea. This was not something Apple announced publicly, of course. In fact, Macworld spotted the change in an Apple support doc: If you scroll down to the section where it says \"On supported models, you can take Night mode photos with Portrait mode,\" and click the hyperlink on \"On supported models,\" you'll pull up a list of iPhones that, mysteriously, doesn't include the 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max. The list includes:\niPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro Max For the uninitiated, Night mode and Portrait mode are technically two distinct features. Portrait mode was released first, all the way back on the iPhone 7 Plus, which utilized the dual-camera system to add a bokeh effect to shots of people. Those early shots were hit or miss, and were often no replacement for a true DSLR, but as Apple's tech and cameras have improved, so has Portrait mode. Part of the improvement was the introduction of Night mode. This feature, which Apple was a bit late to the game on, allowed you to take brighter images in low-light environments by lengthening the time the shutter stays engaged. Older iPhones without the feature would take images that were hard to see without the flash engaged, but Night mode could pull in details as long as there was just enough light present in the scene. Since the iPhone 12 Pro, Portrait mode came with the option of Night mode, as well. If you're trying to take a portrait shot in a dark environment, Night mode kicks in and gives the image a chance to turn out brighter and more detailed. But now, it seems, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max do not have this option. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, these new iPhones still have Night mode: Per that previously mentioned support page, you can take brighter shots at night when taking standard photos, selfies, and time-lapse videos. It just seems Apple decided to remove the feature for Portrait mode shots on its latest Pros.Of course, this news started breaking on Dec. 3, nearly three months after the 17 Pros launched. If it took this long for someone to notice a missing feature, was it really all that important to begin with? I don't have a 17 Pro, so I really can't say, but I also can't say I take many Portrait mode shots in dark environments. I've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this story if I hear back. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

An RC, as the name implies, is the version of a software update Apple intends to release to the general public. Before it rolls out, though, Apple sends the update out to beta testers to see if there are any bugs or glitches that need addressing. If not, these are the updates that will hit your Apple devices sometime this month. That includes watchOS 26.2, Apple's latest OS for its line of smartwatches. While there aren't nearly as many new features and changes in this update as there were in watchOS 26 proper, there are still some key things to highlight in this RC. In fact, as noted by 9to5Mac, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  \nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. Going forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.Music app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 RC that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. When does watchOS 26.2 come out?Apple doesn't have a set date for watchOS 26.2, or iOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2 for that matter. However, now that the RCs are out, these updates are likely coming soon. As long as there aren't any glaring bugs or glitches in these RCs, Apple will likely ship the updates sometime this month.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Fraudsters prey on people's fear, confusion, and desire to protect their money, which may lead targets to hand over login credentials, make irreversible wire transfers, or provide other sensitive information without stopping to question their actions. Android users in the U.S. will soon have extra protection against scams targeting their financial apps, preventing threat actors impersonating bank representatives from accessing data on their devices. Google's in-call scam protection is designed to prevent users from sharing their screens with threat actors and help them avoid revealing their banking information. How Android in-call protection worksAndroid's scam protection kicks in if you are on a phone call with a number not saved in your contacts and attempt to open a participating financial app. You'll get a pop-up warning that the call is likely a scam with a reminder not to make payments or share personal information and a button to end the call (and stop screen sharing). There's also a 30-second delay on further action on your device, which Google says is designed to disrupt any sense of urgency. \nNote that financial institutions must opt into in this feature—at this time, Google has specifically named Cash App and JPMorganChase as partners, though it indicates expansion to other popular fintechs and banks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle initially rolled out in-call protections for banking apps to UK users earlier this year as part of a larger package of security features announced ahead of Google I/O. That launch also included real-time scam detection alerts for calls and texts, improved theft protection via remote lock and identity check, key verifier for Google Messages, and device-level Advanced Protection (in addition to account-level settings). Alongside the US pilot, in-call scam protections will now cover most major banks in the UK as well as financial apps in Brazil and India. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's the hard part.You could look up the documentation for the application or explore the menu bar—but if you're on a Mac, you could also just install KeyClu. This free application shows an overlay with all the keyboard shortcuts for the currently open Mac application, which is very useful for anyone trying to become a more keyboard-savvy computer user.To get started, install the application. Then, you'll need to choose a trigger key (basically one of the modifier keys on your keyboard). By default, you will tap the key twice and hold on the second tap to trigger the overlay, but you can optionally set the application to simply press and hold the key if you prefer. I opted to press and hold Command.\nAfter that, you'll be asked to enable permissions so KeyClu can access the keyboard shortcuts for your applications. Then you can start using the application. I tend to ignore the application until I wonder whether a keyboard shortcut for a particular function exists. I trigger the application, look through the list of keyboard shortcuts, and see what's available. When I let go of the trigger key, the window disappears.This default floating window is useful, but you might want a window listing shortcuts to stay open even when you let go of the trigger. That's where the persistent panel comes in. This window, which you can trigger using the menu bar, stays open and always shows a list of keyboard shortcuts for the currently active application. You can add a separate keyboard shortcut for this window in the settings, if you like.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf you dig around in KeyClu's settings, you can configure the layout of both the pop-up and persistent panels, changing the size of the windows, how many columns shortcuts are sorted into, and which display the panels show up on.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's a simple piece of software, but it's completely free and can help you get better at using your computer.

While Meta is no bastion of user privacy by any stretch of the imagination, this particular claim is, fortunately, not true. You shouldn't expect the company to necessarily respect your data, but you also don't need to worry that future iterations of Meta AI will be generating text based on your Instagram DMs.If you've seen these claims on your feeds, too, you know they're often quite stark and hyperbolic. Snopes highlights one such viral Instagram post that reads, \"Every conversation. Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI.\" Users scrolling through Instagram might understandably stop to read these claims, and may, also understandably, feel concerned about their data across their various Meta accounts.The issue is, these claims are misinterpreting a real change Meta plans for its privacy policy. Once the policy updates on Dec. 16, Meta is making changes to the way it collects data from user interactions with Meta AI. Going forward, the data generated when using Meta's AI products can be used to personalize the content you see on Meta platforms, as well as the ads that are placed in your feeds. Once again, it's just more data collection in the pursuit of promoting user engagement and ad relevancy.\nPart of the confusion is in the way this privacy policy is worded. Take the following statement, a part of Meta's explanation of the user information it uses: \"Interactions with AI at Meta and related metadata. For example, information you or others exchange with AI at Meta like content and messages.\" That might sound like Meta is scraping your DMs to train its AI, but it's saying content and messages you share with Meta's AI are what's fair game. Just sending messages and attachments to users on Meta platforms doesn't end up in Meta AI's training data, but if you share those messages and attachments with the AI, then it might. Meta confirmed as much with outlets, sending the following statement: “The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn’t about DMs at all, it’s about how we’ll use people’s interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience. We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn’t new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.” Make no mistake, of course: If you're using a Meta messaging platform, the company does collect your data. In both the current and upcoming privacy policies, Meta does say messages you send and receive, including their content as well as their metadata, subject to applicable law, can be used by Meta for a number of functions. That might include personalizing Meta products to fit each user; improving Meta products in general; promoting safety and security on its platforms; storing, moving, and processing your data around the world; and processing information when the law requires.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, there are categories Meta will not use your messages for, unless you share those messages with its AI. That includes using your data for analytics and services for business; \"providing a seamless experience\" across Meta products; personalizing ads on Meta Audience Network; research and innovation for \"social good;\" anonymizing your info; and sharing data with law enforcement. In some of these cases, Meta will collect metadata about your messages—perhaps things like time or location sent—but not the message data itself. Again, this article is not meant to flatter Meta; rather, it's to debunk unnecessary concerns. Social media posts often misrepresent these nuanced privacy and security points—especially when those posts turn up the dramatics. Understand if you're using Meta products, your data is constantly being collected—but, in this case, your messages aren't suddenly being scraped to train AI.The best thing you can do to preserve your privacy and security with your Meta messages is to use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) whenever possible. WhatsApp has E2EE built-in, and Meta has automatically started rolling it out for Messenger, but you might need to manually start an E2EE chat for existing conversations in the app. The same goes for Instagram: Meta offers E2EE, but you need to enable it yourself. In either app, tap the name of the chat to check whether or not that conversation is currently E2EE.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Apple's default browser runs faster, is less cluttered, offers privacy features Google would never contemplate, and doesn't try to cram AI down your throat.But that doesn't mean Safari is perfect. Like all browsers, it works better if you install the right extensions. Here are a few I've found in the past year or so that make the best browser even better.Block ads and other clutter\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe internet is increasingly useless without a good ad blocker, and the best ad blocker for Safari—which works on both macOS and mobile devices—is wBlock. This extension uses the built-in ad blocking functionality offered by Safari, which is much faster than the workarounds that extensions on browsers like Chrome need to use. It also supports a number of popular blocklists, with automatic updating. Or you can go even further and install Userscripts. Best of all, it's completely free. Try it out if you're not happy with your current ad blocker.\nAdd a dark mode to sites that don't have one\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWe can argue endlessly about whether dark or light mode are better (and I have), but we can all agree it's annoying to be using dark mode only for the websites you're browsing to be white as snow. That's where Noir comes in. This extension forces Dark Mode in Safari on websites that otherwise don't offer the feature. It's a must-have for dark mode enthusiasts.Automatically open picture in picture when you switch tabsSafari, on mobile, will keep playing videos using picture-in-picture mode if you switch to another application or tab. The desktop version of Safari doesn't do this, which is a shame. Autopip is a Safari extension for Mac that adds this feature. The result: you can keep watching a video in the background while you're working in another tab or application. It's perfect if you're the sort of person who leaves a video playing while you're working on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nQuickly copy the URL for the current site\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nArc, the browser, is dead, and if I'm honest I only miss one feature: the ability to copy the URL of the current website using the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-C. Yes, it's a very specific thing to miss, but I can't overstate how much of a habit this became for me. And I can keep the habit thanks to Supercopy, a Safari extension that adds the keyboard shortcut to Safari. Yes: that's all it does. I use it dozens of times every day, though, so for me it's well worth keeping around.Filter Reddit to be less rage inducing\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'd love it if I spent less time on Reddit and I'm sure I'm not alone. The problem: there's a mix of useful and rage-inducing stuff on that website. The good news is Protego lets you filter Reddit to be less infuriating. The idea is to pick a few subreddits you know, in your heart of hearts, you shouldn't be looking at. Do that and you'll be able to use Reddit without ending up down rabbit holes of rage and disgust. You can also filter out posts using keywords and hide promoted content. Trust me: you'll be happier.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.According to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through. Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"The news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC is reporting that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported yesterday that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. How regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.HBO Max probably isn't going awaySince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously. In its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.Whether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to subscribe to Hulu, even as it's working on killing the standalone Hulu app. There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.This is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"Some Warner Bros. shows might come to NetflixNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.For instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"Expect Netflix to ramp up U.S. productionWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"This means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.Gamers need to pay attention tooAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.Netflix will also publish DC ComicsIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.Don't expect Warner Bros. movies to go straight to streamingFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

They’re a solid choice for anyone seeking over-ear headphones with decent noise cancellation and that signature JBL sound. \nAccording PCMag's review, these headphones offer a “sculpted sound signature with palpable bass,” which you can tweak using the adjustable in-app EQ. Long battery life is a major perk: They should last up to 70 hours with ANC off, letting you go at least a week of heavy use between charges. They also have Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity and multipoint pairing, as well as three different ambient modes and a built-in mic for calls. The 770NCs come in three colors, and the design is lightweight and foldable, with generous cushioning and a padded headband. While control buttons are responsive, they can be tricky to distinguish by feel, and PCMag notes that controls can be sensitive to misfires. The adaptive noise cancellation likewise isn’t top-tier; while it will reduce outside sound, it doesn’t do much against low-frequency noise.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThose caveats aside, if you want comfortable, long-lasting over-ear headphones with bass-y sound for a budget price (and you don’t need best-in-class noise cancellation), the JBL Tune 770NC wireless headphones land firmly in the “good enough” category, and deliver strong value at the current 47% discount.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It is a simple, handsome speaker that focuses almost entirely on how it looks and sounds. At $179, down from $219—its lowest price yet according to price tracking tools—it becomes easier to appreciate that restraint.\nThe metal frame and fabric-wrapped body give it a clean, home-friendly look, and at two pounds, it feels sturdy without being tied to a single spot in your house. The physical buttons on top cover everything you need: power, pairing, playback, and volume. It even handles phone calls, and the microphone performs well enough for quick chats. You never feel like you are juggling menus or waiting for an app to load because there isn’t one.That simplicity carries over to the sound. Bose does not offer EQ adjustments or preset profiles here, so what you hear is exactly what the engineers intended. For a single-driver speaker, the audio is surprisingly full, notes this PCMag review. Bass hits with enough weight to give modern pop tracks some impact, even though very deep sub-bass is out of reach, which is typical for a speaker of this size. Bluetooth 5.3 keeps the stream stable, and multipoint pairing is useful if you like switching between a phone and a laptop. There’s also USB-C audio input, which is rare in portable speakers and handy if you want a wired, lag-free connection. Pairing two units manually unlocks Bose’s Stereo Mode, which spreads out the soundstage and gives music more space, though it requires a second speaker and a specific button sequence.That said, there is no wifi, so you cannot use Spotify Connect or multi-room audio. There is no voice assistant, which might be a dealbreaker if you rely on hands-free control. And with no waterproof rating, it isn't the kind of speaker you can take outside during a drizzle or leave near a bathroom sink. The battery lasts around nine hours on a full charge, which is fine but not competitive with some larger models. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEven so, the SoundLink Home succeeds at the one thing many speakers overcomplicate. It delivers rich, pleasant audio without setup hoops or extra software.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The ANC AirPods 4 are $99 (originally $179.99) after a 45% discount. This is the lowest price they've ever been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe AirPods 4 have updated USB-C charging. Both models (the ANC and non-ANC) are powered by Apple's H2 chip, so you'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" and answer calls. Apple added a live translation feature to the ANC model when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year.The biggest difference if you choose to go with the non-ANC is that you'll miss out on the charging case with a built-in speaker, which you can use with Find My to locate it if you lose them. You'll also miss features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio (combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBoth versions are rated IP54 for dust and water resistance, offer up to five hours of listening per charge (up to 30 hours with the charging case), and can handle automatic switching with your other Apple devices. You can read more about the non-ANC AirPods in PCMag's \"excellent\" review, and more about the ANC AirPods in PCMag's \"outstanding\" review.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Writing essays, editing photos, producing social-media slop, doing your browsing for you, making plenty of mistakes—and now, if you've installed the latest Android 16 update (currently rolling out to Pixel phones), summarizing your notifications so you have less text and fewer alerts to wade through.The new summarization feature, as per Google, will \"help you cut through the clutter and stay focused,\" and give you \"quick understanding and context at a glance.\" I'm all for cutting through the clutter, so as soon as the update landed on my own Pixel device, I decided to enable the feature and see how useful it really is.How AI summaries work, and how to turn them on\n    \n            \n            Enabling the feature on an Android phone.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAI notification summaries won't automatically take over your phone, after the update—you need to enable them manually. From Settings, head to Notifications, then tap Notification summaries to turn this on. The same screen lets you choose which apps you want notifications summarized for.\nThere are actually two parts to the new update: the actual notification summaries, and what Google is calling a \"notification organizer.\" This organizer is designed to group and silence lower-priority notifications (including social alerts and promotional messages), though there doesn't appear to be a separate toggle switch for this.Of course, other Android phone makers will be able to implement this in whatever way they choose. It looks as though Samsung is testing the feature with the One UI 8.5, which should be launching in beta any day now. A full release of the software is expected early next year, alongside the Galaxy S26 phones.Using AI notification summaries for 24 hoursReady to banish notification clutter from my life, I turned on AI summaries for all my apps to see exactly how this worked. For a start, it doesn't apply to all apps, at least not yet: My Snapchat and Instagram alerts remained the same as always, so further updates will be needed from Google and app developers before this is something you see everywhere.The apps I saw summaries for most often were Google Chat, WhatsApp, and Slack—almost always in group conversations, and some of the time for single messages (the length of the message seems to affect this somehow). And the summaries were ... mostly okay. They tended to catch the gist of who had said what, and in that sense were an accurate recap of what I was missing by not actually opening these apps.\n    \n            \n            The summaries work, up to a point.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThese summaries did update as more messages were added, but the summary preview window is only a couple of lines long—so once multiple people start piling into a group chat, the summary isn't going to be able to cover everything. From the lock screen and pull-down notification shade, it's possible to expand notifications to see full messages (as usual), and then minimize them back to the summary view again.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere was one occasion when the AI notification summaries got confused by the Lifehacker slack and by the various @mentions included—attributing a message to the person who had been tagged in a message, rather than the person who had sent it. On the whole, though, there were no obvious mistakes, just certain details left out from summaries of longer chats that I would've liked to have known about.Now I've tested this out, I'm going to turn it off again, for a couple of reasons—and inaccuracy isn't really one of them (though that might certainly creep in). First, given the small size of the preview window, I'm not sure an AI summary is any more useful than the first couple of lines of text you get as standard anyway. That's usually enough for me to tell whether or not a message is important before opening it.\n    \n            \n            This Slack summary wasn't fully accurate—and Snapchat alerts weren't affected.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSecond, I'm not sure I really want my messages and group chats summarized—at least not the important ones. If a friend, family member, or work colleague has something to tell me, I'd like to know exactly what it is, rather than reading a précis. It feels like AI is being used just for the sake of it—and not for the first time.I didn't see any evidence of the notification organizer in action, by the way, perhaps because of the way I've got my Android notifications set up—there are now a host of granular options for alerts in Android, for silencing and dismissing notifications. This feature sounds vaguely useful, but again, I'm not sure I'm ready to hand over the job of judging how important notifications are over to AI just yet.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We are so inundated with spam calls these days that refusing to answer incoming calls en masse isn't actually a bad strategy. When that call could be someone trying to break into your bank account, or alerting you to fraudulent credit card charges that never happened, perhaps it's best to just wait for friends and family to text instead. But let's say the call is from you to someone you know and trust, and let's assume they see it's you who's calling. Even though they know the call isn't spam, there are still plenty of reasons someone won't pick up the phone—including, of course, because they don't actually want to talk right now. But if you really need to get a hold of someone and don't want meetings, commutes, or the lack of desire for a phone call to get in the way, Google is currently working on a solution you can try right now. The new feature, named \"Call Reason,\" is designed to separate important phone calls from the rest. When you start dialing a number, Google will give you the option to mark the call as urgent. If you choose to do so, the person you're calling will see a pop-up reading \"It's urgent!\" on the call screen. Hopefully, that pop-up will encourage them to answer; however, I imagine they'll stop picking up if you start using it too often. \nThat said, not everyone ignores calls on purpose. If you aren't by your phone when it goes off, or if it's on silent in your pocket or bag, you obviously won't catch the urgent tag on the call screen. In that case, Android adds the urgent tag to the missed call in their recipient's call history. As long as the person you're trying to reach checks out their missed calls, they should see that this one was marked urgent—though if it's a real emergency, they might've received extra calls and messages from you in the interim anyway. It seems Google has been working on this feature for some time. Android Authority previously spotted something called Expressive Calling in the Phone app's APK, which would let the caller add animations and emojis to calls. In addition to that functionality, however, was the ability to flag the reason for a call when dialing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to try Call Reason Google is still testing the Call Reason feature, but anyone using the current version of the Google Phone app will be able to try it out. (It's still rolling out, though, so you may not see it yet.) The feature also only works with saved contacts, and when calling Android users who have Google's Phone app set as the primary calling app.  When Call Reason does show up on your phone, you'll see it appear after placing your call. The UI says \"Mark call as urgent?,\" with a prompt letting you know that the call will ring through and show the call is urgent. Tap \"Notify,\" and you're set. Once the recipient sees the call, they'll see the \"Incoming call\" banner replaced by an animated \"It's urgent!\" pop-up. It's a fun design, but perhaps a bit too fun, when you're likely using this in important situations.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nAlongside Call Reason, Google announced a number of new features for Android 16. There are now improved parental controls locked behind a PIN of the parents' choosing; new UI customization options, like expanded dark mode support and new custom shapes for home screen icons; and the continued roll out of Google's AI notification summaries, which Lifehacker writer David Nield hasn't found all that useful yet.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Today, YouTube announced that it's going to allow creators to upload bigger thumbnails, plus make browsing and shopping while watching on a TV a bit more convenient. But there's also a big change coming to content itself, and it's not just limited to TVs. Soon, YouTube is going to start using AI to automatically upscale any videos with resolutions lower than 1080p. While you can technically still upload videos that are 720p nowadays, with smartphone cameras getting better and better, that essentially reads to me as \"old videos.\" It's a bit concerning to me, as someone who's been watching a lot of TV shows from the '90s and early 2000s on YouTube as of late.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: YouTube\n                    \n    \nDone right, AI upscaling is a simple way to de-noise a video, and is more resistant to hallucination than generations made from whole cloth. But it's not without its own hiccups, and some creators have actually accused YouTube of using AI upscaling already, without telling them, and with some undesirable results. The accusations have been limited to YouTube Shorts for now, but notably, even Will Smith seems to have possibly run afoul of the system's hidden AI, as the celebrity was himself accused of generating a crowd with AI in a YouTube Short of a recent concert. However, internet sleuths have determined the footage is likely legit, but was automatically made to look like \"AI slop\" by YouTube. Note, for instance, how different the footage looks on Instagram.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLuckily, YouTube says that this version of AI upscaling will be fully in the hands of creators and users. According to the feature's announcement \"Creators will retain complete control over their library, as both original files and original video resolution will be kept intact, with a clear option to opt-out of these enhancements.\" Viewers, meanwhile, will be able to see when AI upscaling has been used thanks to a \"super resolution\" label in the resolution selection settings, and opt for the original resolution instead.Additionally, YouTube told The Verge that videos that were shot below 1080p, but manually remastered and uploaded in 1080p or above, won't be affected by the upscaling tech. What matters is the resolution the video was uploaded in.All of that's a relief for folks like me, who don't want bizarre seven-fingered extras in our sitcoms, although it's unclear whether this control will also extend to YouTube Shorts, or if YouTube might continue experimenting with mandatory AI upscaling there behind-the-scenes (which, to be fair, has not yet been confirmed).Regardless, it makes sense why YouTube is making this change, as it tries to capture more eyes across more devices. Low resolution videos might look fine on a six-inch smartphone display, but blown up to 50+ inches on a TV, not so much. YouTube hasn't said exactly when the feature will go live, but if you notice what looks like weird AI artifacting the next time you're watching a YouTube video, try checking the resolution settings by mousing over the video and tapping or clicking the cog icon.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I love my M1 iMac, but I worry that Apple's first version of this new update isn't quite optimized for the five-year-old chip, and have been waiting to see if a future version of Tahoe performs a bit better. As it happens, that next version is well on its way—and does seem improved, at that. Apple has been beta testing macOS Tahoe 26.1 alongside iOS 26.1 since September, and it dropped the release candidates for both of the updates on Tuesday. The \"RC,\" as the name implies, is what Apple thinks is the finished version of any given software release. Barring any major bugs or glitches discovered by developers and public testers, this will be the version of macOS Tahoe 26.1 released to the general public. That release will likely come next week. In the meantime, we know what features Apple has in store for Mac users who decide to update. This is a much smaller revision than macOS 26, but 26.1 does bring some interesting new features for users to explore. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nControl over Liquid Glass' appearanceBy far the most striking difference between this year's Apple updates and last year's is Liquid Glass. This new design language is Apple's most drastic UI change in years, and while some people love it, others hate it. I've enjoyed the new look on my iPhone, but I understand why some users dislike how some elements let the background shine through, in some cases reducing visibility.Apple seems to have taken the criticism to heart: With macOS Tahoe, as well as iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1, the company now gives users the option to control how Liquid Glass looks, at least to a degree. The new toggle, which you can find in System Settings >  Appearance, has two options: \"Clear,\" which retains the original look of Liquid Glass, and \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of your system's UI elements. With Tinted, you won't see as much of the background poke through, and whatever does come through doesn't take over the overlayed element as much. If you find Liquid Glass in macOS Tahoe too clear and \"glassy,\" this might be a good option to try. Expanded support for Apple Music AutoMix Apple's latest round of updates introduced a new DJ-like feature to Apple Music. AutoMix will automatically build a transition between songs, fading one song into another. It's a cool feature (when it works well), and can make transitioning between dissimilar songs a lot smoother.With macOS 26.1, AutoMix now works over AirPlay. Previously, you lost this feature when beaming your music to an AirPlay device.Better FaceTime audio qualityApple says that Mac users updating to 26.1 should experience improved FaceTime audio quality in low-bandwidth conditions. The company doesn't elaborate, but this is good news on its, uh, face: If you're calling someone in a low-signal area, or with a weak wifi connection, you should be able to hear each other better.Communication Safety and Web content filters for child accountsIf your Mac has child accounts (made for ages 13 through 17), Communication Safety and Web content filters will be enabled by default for those accounts after updating to this latest version. These filters are designed to limit adult websites, protecting underage users from content they shouldn't be accessing. A new Network iconAs spotted by the MacOSBeta subreddit, Apple has updated the Network icon for macOS 26.1. The new icon looks great, in my opinion, sporting a blue theme with glow effects:\nA new Macintosh HD iconSimilarly, the Macintosh HD icon gets a small refresh. The original Tahoe icon was a major redesign over the previous, iconic icon. Now, Apple has removed the additional elements to simplify the design. (I still miss the original.) \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nA few security updates, probablyApple hasn't announced security updates for macOS 26.1 yet, but in all likelihood, they will. Apple doesn't often issue true security patches like other companies, barring an emergency patch. Instead, the company usually bundles its security patches within point updates like 26.1. Once the official update drops, expect Apple to update its security release notes to include details about these patches.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Football season is in full swing, but these are such strange days that even of game day, Americans can no longer put their political differences aside to enjoy the savage ballet. Yes, the National Football League has once again become a flashpoint in the endless, maddening culture wars—and surprisingly, the NFL seems to be on the \"woke\" side of the board. Right now, there's a lot of misinformation being spread about the game, the league, and the personalities within. Here are some of the biggest I've encountered.Did Andy Reid refuse pledge to not attend the 2026 Super Bowl over a planned Charlie Kirk tribute?The questionable Facebook pages of both Kollam's Media and Together We Rise both recently claimed that Andy Reid, head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, \"ignited one of the most explosive controversies in sports history\" when he refused to attend the 2026 Super Bowl because of a tribute to Charlie Kirk planned for the opening ceremonies. But that didn't happen. There are multiple levels of deception at work here. First, we have no reason to think that the NFL has planned its opening ceremonies this early, and if they have, there's no reason they would have shared them with Andy Reid anyway. So it follows that Reid did not preemptively announce a boycott of the 2026 Super Bowl, and there is no evidence of him doing so aside from those Facebook posts. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt is true that Reid most likely won't be attending the Super Bowl this year: His team is currently battling the Raiders for third place in a four-team division. Did Dolly Parton, Alan Jackson, and George Strait refuse to perform a Charlie Kirk tribute at Super Bowl 2026?Together We Rise's Facebook page is evidently on the cutting edge of fake stories about the Super Bowl and Charlie Kirk, as another post there reports Alan Jackson, Dolly Parton, George Strait, Vince Gill, and Reba McEntire all declined to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show over a planned tribute to Charlie Kirk. But again, there is no known \"tribute to Charlie Kirk\" planned for the Super Bowl, and the performer for halftime is Bad Bunny anyway, meaning there's nothing for this random cadre of vaguely left-leaning country artists to boycott. Did Coca-Cola pull its sponsorship of the 2026 halftime show?Speaking of Bad Bunny, according to a Facebook post from PR Informa, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey responded to the announcement of Bad Bunny's halftime gig by pledging, \"I will end my sponsorship of the Super Bowl if they let Bad Bunny to perform at halftime.\"  Quincey never said this, and Coca-Cola hasn't advertised during the Super Bowl since since 2020 anyway.  All the advertising has been purchased already for the game, and no company has announced plans to pull out over Bad Bunny's performance, nor for any other reason. Did Carlos Santana object to Bad Bunny playing at the Super Bowl?Despite post circulating on social media suggesting music icon Carlos Santana objected to Bad Bunny playing the Super Bowl, it's just not true. Santana addressed the rumor on his own Facebook page, posting, \"Fear is the flavor right now. Fear is what motivates ignorant people to put words in my mouth—saying that I didn’t want Bad Bunny to be represented at the Super Bowl. I never said that, nor would I ever.”Is the NFL considering pulling Bad Bunny's halftime show?When asked about the rumors that the NFL was considering pulling Bad Bunny from the 2026 halftime show, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made it clear the league stands behind Bad Bunny. \"He’s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell told ESPN. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism.\"Did Travis Kelce sue Karoline Leavitt, buy a diner for homeless people, and announce he impregnated Taylor Swift?Travis Kelce did not sue Karoline Leavitt, buy a diner for homeless people, or announce that he and Taylor Swift are having a child. He didn't donate his bonus to a homeless non-profit, threaten to \"twist Elon Musk into a pretzel,\" or rent out Disneland for a day. Dude's just a football player, damn. That Kelce is a center for misinformation is clearly because he's among the highest profile players out there, he has a high-profile fiancée, and he doesn't completely hide his political views. Not that Kelce is anything like an activist, but having done a commercial encouraging people to get vaccinated is enough to put a celebrity in certain crosshairs. The Super Bowl is rigged in favor of...This is a preemptive debunking: We don't yet know who is going to be in the big game, but when we find out, there are bound to be conspiracy theories suggesting the game is being rigged in favor of one team, for whatever reason. But as far as we know, the Super Bowl hasn't been rigged in the past, and it probably won't be this time, either. Remember: Last season's pre-Super Bowl rumor was the game would be fixed in favor of The Chiefs, and it didn't exactly work out that way. Why is football suddenly so controversial?Maybe I'm looking at the past with astroturf-colored glasses, but football used to be something like a shared national pastime. Sure, there were a ton of false beliefs about the game out there, but they were things like, \"The refs cheat,\" or \"The Raiders are a lock.\"  It didn't matter whether you were a Democrat or a Republican, we all laughed at the Jets. But like every other cultural event or institution, football is also being sorted into Team Red and Team Blue, neither of which has attractive jerseys. It's such a drag that we can’t just enjoy the circus without someone turning it into the next political crisis.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I, alongside millions of other users, visit the site daily to learn something new or double-check existing knowledge. In an age of non-stop AI slop, Wikipedia is something of an antidote.If you look at Wikipedia and think \"this is alright, but an AI version would be a lot better,\" you might just be Elon Musk. Musk's AI company, xAI, just launched Grokipedia—yes, that really is its name—an online encyclopedia that closely resembles Wikipedia in name and surface-level appearance. But under the hood, the two could hardly be any more different. Though it's early days for the new \"encyclopedia,\" I'd say it's not worth using, at least not for anything real.   The Grokipedia experienceWhen you load up the Grokipedia website, it looks fairly standard. You see the Grokipedia name, alongside the version number (v0.1, at the time of writing), alongside a search bar and an \"Articles Available\" counter (885,279). Searching for an article too is basic: You type in a query, and a list of available articles appears for you to select from. Once you pull up an article, it looks like Wikipedia, only extremely basic: There are no images, only text, though you can use the sidebar to jump between sections of the article. You'll also find sources, noted by numbers, which correspond to the References portion at the bottom of each article. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe key difference between Grokipedia and a simple version of Wikipedia, however, is that these articles are not written and edited by real people. Instead, each article is generated and \"fact-checked\" by Grok, xAI's large language model (LLM). LLMs are able to generate large amounts of text in short periods of time, and include sources for where they pull their information, which might make the pitch for Grokipedia sound great to some. However, LLMs also have a tendency to hallucinate, or, in other words, make things up. Sometimes, the sources the AI is pulling from are unreliable or facetious; other times, the AI takes it upon itself to \"lie,\" and generate text that simply isn't true. In both cases, the information cannot be trusted, especially not at face value, which is why it's troubling to see much of the experience is entirely powered by Grok, without human intervention. Grokipedia vs. WikipediaMusk is pitching Grokipedia as a \"massive improvement\" over Wikipedia, which he has criticized for pushing propaganda, particularly towards left-leaning ideas and politics. It's ironic, then, that some of these Grokipedia entries are themselves pulling from Wikipedia. As The Verge's Jay Peters highlights, articles like MacBook Air note the following at the bottom: \"The content is adapted from Wikipedia, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License.\" What's more, Peters found that some Grokipedia articles, such as PlayStation 5 and the Lincoln Mark VIII, are almost one-to-one copies of the corresponding articles on Wikipedia. If you've followed Musk's politics and political activities in recent years, it won't surprise you to learn he falls on the right-wing side of the political spectrum. That might give pause to anyone who considers using Grokipedia as an unbiased source of information, especially as Musk has continuously retooled Grok to generate responses more favorable to right-wing opinions. Critics like Musk claim Wikipedia is biased towards the left, but Grokipedia is entirely produced by an AI model with an abject bias.You'll see that you have very different experiences when reading certain topics across Wikipedia and Grokipedia. Wikipedia's Tylenol article, for example, reads the following: In 2025, Donald Trump made several statements about a controversial and unproven connection between autism and Tylenol. These statements, about the connection between Tylenol during pregnancy and autism, are based on unreliable sources without scientific evidence.Compare that to Grokipedia, which devotes three paragraphs to the subject, the first of which begins:Multiple observational studies and meta-analyses have identified associations between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) and increased risks of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).That said, the second paragraph highlights some of the issues with those studies, while the third highlights that certain agencies suggest the \"benefits outweigh unproven risks.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSimilarly, as spotted by WIRED, Grokipedia's article, Transgender, highlights the belief that social media may have acted as a \"contagion\" to the rise in transgender identification. Not only is that a common right-wing assertion, that particular word could have been plucked from a post from a right-wing X account. Wikipedia's article, as you might expect, does not entertain the claim at all. Grokipedia is also favorable to unproven, controversial, or flat-out absurd claims. As Rolling Stone highlights, it refers to \"Pizzagate,\" a conspiracy theory that lead to a real-life shooting, as “allegations,” a “hypothesis,” and a “narrative.” Grokipedia gives credence to “Great Replacement,\" a racist theory floated by white supremacists.   Should you use Grokipedia?Here's the short answer: no. The issue I have with Grokipedia is two-fold: First, no encyclopedia is going to be reliable when it is almost entirely created by AI models. Sure, some of the information may be accurate, and it's great you can see the sources the bot is using, but when the risk of hallucination is baked into the technology with no way around it, choosing to avoid human intervention en masse all but ensures inaccuracies will plague much of Grokipedia's knowledge base. As if that wasn't enough, this Grokipedia is built on an LLM that Musk is openly tinkering with to generate results that more closely align with his worldview, and the worldview of one particular political ideology. Hallucination and bias—just the ingredients you need for an encyclopedia.The thing about Wikipedia is it's written and edited by humans. Those humans can hold other human writers accountable, adding new information when it becomes available and correcting mistakes when they encounter them. Perhaps it's frustrating to read that your favorite health and human services secretary \"promoted vaccine misinformation and public-health conspiracy theories,\" but that's the objective, scientific reality. Removing these objective descriptions, and reframing the discussion in a way that fits a warped worldview doesn't make Grokipedia better than Wikipedia—it makes it useless.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Unlike an LCD, which uses a single backlight for all the pixels of the display, all of the pixels on an OLED display can be individually lit up or turned off entirely. That means dark areas of the screen are inky black, while brighter areas can be selectively illuminated. It just looks fantastic, and if I have the option, I always try to choose it.OLED isn't new tech at this point, and yet, Apple has been slow to adopt it into its products, especially when compared to some of its competitors. The company's first device to feature OLED was the Apple Watch in 2015, then the iPhone X in 2017, whereas every Samsung Galaxy has featured an AMOLED display since the company introduced the line in 2010. The iPhone remained the only product line with OLED for quite some time, until it included them with the M4 iPad Pros. Aside from these products, Apple tends to choose alternative display types for its devices. For certain products, like the iMac, MacBook Air, and most iPads, it still uses LCD. For more \"premium\" devices, like the MacBook Pro, it uses mini-LED, which offers a large number of backlight \"zones.\" This gives these products more contrast than the single backlight of LCD, but not quite as much as OLED. I prefer watching shows and movies on my iPad with mini-LED than my LCD iMac, for example, but I'd always prefer my OLED TV.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple's OLED roadmapAs it turns out, Apple might give me some new OLED options in the future. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is working on bringing OLED to more of its devices. Gurman says that the company is currently testing the tech for the MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Air, all of which now ship with LCD. In addition, the company is reportedly working on an OLED MacBook Pro, which might also ship with a touchscreen.Before you get too excited for an OLED MacBook, Apple is likely starting the OLED rollout with the iPad—specifically, the iPad mini. Gurman's sources say the OLED mini will drop sometime next year, which would mark the first refresh for the device since 2024. While I'd love an OLED Mac, this might be the perfect excuse for me to pick up an iPad mini, which I've long thought of as the most fun of Apple's devices.Gurman isn't sure when Apple will add OLED to the iPad Air, but it won't be with the next refresh. The next-gen iPad Air will likely launch this spring, and will ship with LCD. That's true for the M5 MacBook Air, as well. While Apple is testing OLED for the Air, the next model will be out this spring sporting the same display tech as the M4. An OLED MacBook Air might not hit stores until 2028.If you'll buy any Mac that Apple sells with OLED, you're going to be buying a Pro. That OLED MacBook Pro might even come with a touchscreen, which would be a first for Apple's Mac line. That machine could be out as early as 2026, but Apple could also push them to 2027.Adding OLED to products won't come cheap, though. Gurman suggests that Apple could raise the price of the iPad mini $100, which would drive the starting cost from $499 to $599. When those OLED MacBook Pros come out, they'll also likely be even more expensive than the current Pros, by at least a few hundred dollars. These machines start at $1,999 (14-inch) and $2,499 (16-inch) today, so their OLED, touchscreen counterparts could fetch a high price tag. You probably shouldn't wait for these devices if you need to upgradeIf you're holding out on buying any new Apple tech until the company refreshes those devices with OLED, you're going to be waiting a while—at least, for anything other than the iPad mini. I'd recommend waiting for that particular device, but for the others, it might be a while indeed. If you really need an upgrade, Apple's current iPad Pros ship with OLED, and the mini-LED tech in its MacBook Pros is also excellent. But even the LCDs on its devices look quite good. If you can stomach seeing the backlight when dark elements are on-screen, an iPad Air or MacBook Air will suit you well. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Walk through any park these days and you might spot them: people sporting bulky weighted vests, adding 10, 20, even 30 pounds to their morning stroll. Scroll through social media and you'll find countless influencers touting weighted vests as the secret to building unbreakable bones and sculpted muscles. Many videos have gained hundreds of thousands of views with claims that weighted vests will \"transform your body\"—a claim that, to be fair, is par for the course in any fitness trend. \"Weighted vest walks\" are popular enough to be parodied, and even if I find those videos a little mean-spirited, they do point to an important question: Does this trendy fitness accessory actually deliver on its promises?Let's dig into what science really says about weighted vests—and what they can (and can't) do for your body.The claim: Weighted vests can build bone density or stop bone lossI can see how this theory sounds legit. Bones respond to mechanical stress by becoming stronger—it's why astronauts lose bone density in zero gravity, and why weight-bearing exercise is recommended for osteoporosis prevention. So logically, strapping on extra weight should signal your bones to bulk up, right? Not exactly.\nAccording to Dr. Leah Verebes, a professor at the Touro School of Health Science's DPT program, the reality is more nuanced. \"Some research, particularly among elderly persons and postmenopausal women, suggests that the use of a weighted vest while exercising, or plain walking, can slow bone loss or improve bone density modestly—especially in the legs and hips,\" she says.However, the gains are far from dramatic. Verebes notes that \"results are variable and gains are minimal.\" Traditional resistance training like weightlifting and higher-impact activities like jogging or jumping produce significantly better results. A 2023 review found that while weighted vests may help maintain bone mineral density, the overall quality of evidence supporting this benefit remains low to moderate.Weighted vests can help maintain bone strength, particularly for people who can't tolerate high-impact exercise due to joint issues or other limitations. But they're not a substitute for proper resistance training or impact activities.The claim: Wearing a weighted vest builds muscle and increases strength.Here's where expectations need serious adjustment. Yes, adding weight to your body does increase the resistance during bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and step-ups. And yes, this can contribute to improvements in muscular endurance and modest strength gains. But there's a catch.\"Vest walking also increases caloric expenditure and activates muscles more than regular walking, but the weight is typically too low to induce significant muscle growth,\" Verebes says. Most weighted vests are designed to be 5-15% of your body weight—enough to make your workout harder, but not enough to trigger substantial muscle building.Think of it this way: If you weigh 150 pounds, a 10% weighted vest adds just 15 pounds. That's less resistance than you'd use for a basic strength training exercise. \"Significant muscle growth continues to require progressive resistance training with more substantial weights,\" Verebes says.So, weighted vests can intensify your workout and improve muscular endurance, but they won't replace a proper strength training program if your goal is building significant muscle mass.The risks nobody's posting aboutWhile social media showcases people effortlessly crushing workouts in weighted vests, the reality is that adding load to your body comes with real risks. Verebes says that \"too much excess weight can cause strain on joints, especially the knees, hips, and lower back.\" The increased load can also impair balance and increase fall risk, a particular concern for older adults who might be using vests specifically to improve bone health.Perhaps most concerning is the risk of overuse injuries when people add weight too quickly. \"Professionals recommend starting with a light vest—roughly 5–10% body weight—and adding to it gradually as strength and tolerance improve,\" Verebes says.What actually works for building strong bones and musclesIf you're serious about improving your musculoskeletal health, Verebes offers evidence-based recommendations:Prioritize resistance training. Weightlifting or using resistance bands remain the most effective methods for keeping bones and muscles strong. Progressive overload—gradually increasing the weight you lift—is key to continued improvement.Include impact and weight-bearing exercise. Walking, hiking, stair climbing, and jumping all provide bone stimulation. Activities that involve impact force your bones to adapt and strengthen.Support exercise with proper nutrition. You can't out-train a poor diet. Adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D are essential for maintaining bone and muscle health. Without proper nutrition, even the best exercise program will fall short.So, should you use a weighted vest?Look, weighted vests aren't worthless. They can add challenge to bodyweight exercises and walking routines, providing modest improvements in muscle endurance and bone maintenance, particularly for older adults or those unable to do high-impact activities.But as Verebes says, \"they are not a shortcut to get to stronger bones and bigger muscles overnight. For significant improvements, regular resistance training and impact exercise remain the gold standard.\"The bottom line? Weighted vests are a tool, not a miracle solution. If you do decide to try a weighted vest, start conservatively with 5-10% of your body weight, add load gradually, and pay attention to how your joints respond. And crucially: Always speak with your doctor first, especially if you have existing joint problems, balance issues, or bone density concerns.\n            ",

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nResearchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Losing something you spent time working on, or photos that you can't replace, is devastating. You might think this is a problem of the past because of cloud storage services like Apple's own iCloud, but that's not completely true.For one thing, users sometimes get locked out of their cloud accounts, which makes it impossible to retrieve their files. For another, not everything on your Mac is stored in iCloud. Things like settings, applications, and customizations aren't easy to recover should something happen to your Mac. It's also a lot faster to retrieve files from a local backup than a cloud one, which is important if you're backing up things like videos or photo libraries. Finally, there's a certain peace of mind that comes from being in control of your backup, as opposed to it being in the hands of a company.For these reasons I recommend you make a full local backup of your Mac. There are many ways to do this, including using third-party software. For most people, though, I recommend something that might sound old-fashioned: an external hard drive and Apple's own Time Machine.\nTime Machine is the simplest way for Mac users to have a local backup. There are other solutions out there, granted, and every Mac power user has their favorite. For the average user, though, it's hard to beat Time Machine. It's simply bundled with the operating system.Just plug in an empty external hard drive—one larger than the drive inside your Mac—and head to System Settings > General > Time Machine. From here you can start backing up in a couple of clicks.This backup includes everything on your drive. That means your documents, photos, and videos, yes, but also everything else. The applications you installed, including large games. Your settings, both for macOS and for every application you have installed. If it's saved on your Mac it's backed up to Time Machine (unless you specifically tell the software not to include it).There are all kinds of ways to retrieve your files from a Time Machine backup. If you are setting up a new Mac there's an option to use your backup to restore your files and settings. Or, if you'd rather not, you can simply drag files from the backup drive to your new Mac.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBy default, Time Machine makes a new backup every hour. Only new files are copied, and versions of deleted files stay on the drive until the drive is full. Time Machine also makes it possible to browse past versions of the same file, if you want. You can customize the frequency of backups—hourly, daily, or weekly are all options. I, personally, find all of these to be overkill, and use a fourth option—manual—instead. And a free application I found makes it seamless.The tool that makes Time Machine work for me\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nMy Mac is a laptop—one that I use away from my desk quite a bit—so I can't leave an external drive plugged into it. I try to plug in my drive when I'm at my desk, but that means I end up accidentally unplugging my Time Machine drive without dismounting it. Do that enough times and you'll end up with a corrupted drive (believe me, I've had this happen multiple times).This is why I was happy to find Easy backup and eject, a free Mac application that runs in the background and does one thing: start a Time Machine backup when you plug in your drive and dismount the drive when the backup is done.With this software installed I can plug in my drive anytime I want to make a backup and stop thinking about it. Backups typically don't take more than a few minutes for me, so by the time I'm ready to leave my desk I can just unplug everything and go about my day. It's perfect. Try it out if you like the idea of Time Machine but can't leave a hard drive constantly plugged in.\n            ",

The company already has AI tools that let you ask Gemini for directions to your destination, or get more info about it, and today, it's rolling out new features to help turn the chatbot into a (to borrow a term from Microsoft) copilot.With Gemini in Google Maps, you'll be able to ask open-ended questions and even have the AI take action for you, based on its responses. The idea is to make the app easier to work with while driving, which, yes, means you can also wake the bot with a simple \"Hey Google.\"Let's say you get peckish while driving. You'll be able to wake the bot with your voice, ask it for restaurants along your drive, and then have it alter your route to direct you to one of them. Or, if you have a passenger with you, they could also summon the bot with a Gemini icon in the top-right corner of the Google Maps screen.This is a major update compared to prior AI integration in Maps, which was mostly restricted to asking questions about certain routes or destinations before you started driving.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGemini will purportedly make Google Maps routes easier to followBut even if you're not actively talking to the AI to help you navigate, it'll still supposedly make Maps better for you. Rather than relying on generic instructions like \"turn right in 500 feet,\" Google says Maps will now also sometimes direct users by pointing out easy-to-spot landmarks along their route instead. That means you might get an instruction saying \"turn right after the Thai Siam Restaurant,\" with the restaurant itself being highlighted on your Maps app as you approach. To do this, the bot will cross-reference Google Street View photos with your route. I'll admit I'm a little skeptical that it might pick an easy-to-miss landmark—I don't trust myself to be able to spot the right restaurant while driving—but if it works, it could be more intuitive than trying to figure out how many feet are between me and my turn.Gemini will work with other apps from within MapsThere's also integration to help you better interact with Google's other apps while in Maps, like Calendar. The company says that, while talking to the bot about your route, you could also ping it to add an event to Calendar; assuming you've already given it permission to do so, it'll automatically follow through on your request. The company's also added a Google Lens button to Maps, so once you arrive at wherever you're going, you'll be able to point your phone at landmarks or your destination and ask Gemini for more details about them without having to leave Maps.Smarter commutesOutside of connecting with other apps, Maps is also getting some of the same features as Waze, but with a twist. Google is adding a feature called Proactive Traffic Alerts to Maps, which sets Gemini to monitor disruptions to your most commonly traveled routes in the background. The idea is that you likely don't open Maps or Waze for your daily commute, which means you're not getting traffic alerts while you drive. Now, the AI will work for you while the app is closed, too, and will notify you on its own if it detects a crash or road closure while you're on one of your routine drives.The catch to all of this? There are plenty of ways it could go wrong, and there's no way to test it yet. Imagine the AI hallucinates a landmark that isn't there or has closed, and you miss a needed turn. In a roundtable with journalists (h/t The Verge), Google Maps product director Amanda Moore insisted that all training is \"using the actual place information in the real world\" and said \"there should be no hallucinations on places to stop at or things like that,\" but this is definitely something I'd want to try out first in a low stakes environment, rather than diving into it immediately on a cross-country road trip. (Even if a landmark is real, that doesn't automatically mean pointing it out will be useful.)When you can try Gemini in Google MapsUnfortunately, it'll take a little while before you can try out any of these new features. Gemini-based navigation starts rolling out \"in the coming weeks\" and Lens in Maps is set for \"later this month.\" Proactive traffic alerts and landmark-based navigation start their rollouts today, but it might still be a bit until they hit your iOS and Android device.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Scammers never miss an opportunity to prey on people's fear and confusion—and now they're capitalizing on the ongoing federal government shutdown to steal money and information from vulnerable targets. As Axios notes, reports of imposter scams—in which fraudsters impersonate government officials or agency representatives—rose in October as Americans experienced the loss of federal services and benefits. The Better Business Bureau's (BBB) Scam Tracker received 211 such complaints last month. Scammers are also taking advantage of shutdown stress to pull people into investment schemes and other malicious (and AI-driven) activity. Common government shutdown scams One common variety of shutdown scam is government impersonation. Bad actors may call, text, or email you pretending to represent a federal agency—like the IRS or Social Security Administration—that has programs or benefits you use. They'll ask you to verify personal information or pay a fee to avoid losing your benefits or interrupting your service. In some cases, they may even threaten you with fines or legal action if you don't comply. This is a common scam tactic that relies on people acting quickly out of fear. \nOther scammers may pose as service providers trying to help you access certain government programs (like passport renewal) or offering grants or financial assistance. Axios highlights one such instance in which the individual received a call about a $5,000 \"relief check.\" There are multiple reports of scammers targeting SNAP recipients with offers of emergency food or grocery relief. People in areas with federal offices or military bases may be targeted specifically.In these cases, bad actors may try to collect sensitive information, which they can use to steal your identity. Scam emails and texts to \"redeem\" or \"claim\" offers are also vectors for phishing links, which may lead to spoofed government websites designed to harvest your login credentials or other data. AI is facilitating many of these schemes: Nevada's deputy secretary of state for securities issued a warning this week about scammers using AI to impersonate government officials, law enforcement, and financial professionals as well as to create deepfakes of trusted individuals known to potential victims—making it more likely that targets will send money or provide access to their information.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nProtect yourself from shutdown scamsYou should always be on guard against common scam tactics, such as any unsolicited communication that either sounds too good to be true or sparks a strong emotion (like fear). Know that scammers will often ramp up activity when people are vulnerable in hopes that you will act before thinking. If you get a call, text, or email from someone who pressures you, it's probably a scam. Never click on links in from unverified sources, and always confirm that the person on the other end is who they claim to be by contacting the organization through their official website or social media channels. You should also verify urgent communication from family or friends—no matter how personal it sounds—especially if you're being asked to send money. Government employees will not call and demand that you hand over money or personal information—and right now, many are furloughed as most federal agencies are closed. (Unfortunately, that includes the Federal Trade Commission, so consumers currently cannot log fraud reports or opt into the Do Not Call registry.) \n            ",

Some methods are adaptable, open to interpretation, and fluid, which is nice if you just need a little guidance. Others, though, are detailed and rule-driven, which is great if you need to be told exactly what to do and when to do it. Agile Results, a system devised by J. D. Meier, is in the second category; it's stricter than others, but for some of us, that's what's needed to get things done. With Agile Results, you schedule and plan around all your goals, from the short- to long-term, so everything gets taken care of—even the biggest big-picture tasks. Here’s how it works.What is the Agile Results method?Meier describes Agile Results as “a results-driven system that helps you get meaning, momentum, and mastery in all areas of your life.” That’s an optimistic, lofty tagline, but in essence, it just boils down to getting more serious with your goal-setting and planning.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nYou’ll focus on “three wins” at every level, from daily up to yearly. (“Wins” are really another words for your goals, but when you say \"wins,\" it implies you already expect to meet them, which sets a certain tone.) First, set three “wins” as goals for your entire year. This can be on the first of a new year or any time as long as you’re looking ahead a full 365 days and your goals are designed to be met within that time period. These are obviously your biggest, most overarching goals—the ones that will take a lot of steps and effort between today and this time next year to turn into true \"wins.\"Next, set quarterly goals. These are the big goals that are going to lead into the annual ones and can be set on the first day of the quarter, if you’re starting on January 1, or every three months if you’re starting at another time. If you're having a hard time determining what should be a quarterly goal, try mind-mapping to help you visualize your larger projects and all the elements that go into them. From there, set monthly goals related to those. In general, it’s best to start this method on the first of a month, just to give it a structure that will be easy to follow, but again, you can do this whenever you want—as long as the goals you list here are the kind that are doable within about four weeks and add up toward the completion of the quarterly and annual wins.After that, set weekly goals every Monday and daily goals every morning, minimizing the size of the goals with each until you’ve created a system of daily building blocks that lead up to weekly wins, weekly tasks that lead up to monthly wins, monthly goals that lead up to quarterly wins, etc. This is where it gets hard to follow, so initially, set a reminder in your phone for each morning (and two for Mondays) that will spur you to create the smaller goals. You can add this into to-do apps you already use. My favorite is Finch, where I can set goals that recur on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, and am rewarded with cute in-app animations when I mark them off, but if you need something else, try some of these. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNo matter how you go about it, schedule 10 minutes every morning to set your daily goals, allowing 15 to 20 minutes on days that will see you structuring weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual goals. Keep in mind that these are supposed to be structured and organized, so you should rely on a planner or easily accessible document to get it done. I recommend using Google Sheets and setting aside a designated sheet for each set of goals within a single workbook. Using a cloud-based software instead of Excel or similar will make it easy to pull up the goals wherever you are.Take this part seriously. The conscious process of setting the goals isn't something to rush through. Use time blocking and time boxing to designate specific times to do it—and stick to those times. Finally, make sure the wins—from daily to annual—are concrete. I recommend using SMART goals to write detailed, thoughtful assertions about what your goals are, as they help you stick to a schedule and stay realistic. Reviewing is key to Agile ResultsSetting aside time every morning to write down your goals is essential, but so, too, is setting aside time every afternoon to review your progress. Every day, reflect on how you did with your daily goals. Every Friday, expand your reflection time to include your weekly goals and, at the end of each month, make sure you’re reviewing your monthly goals, too. Keep this going all the way to the end of the year, when you should be able to look back and see how far you came in reaching your annual “wins.” Meier suggests that on Fridays, you take time to write down three things that are going well and three things that need improvement. Here's where you can borrow the idea of the after-action review from the Army; you need to identify what went wrong and what went right so you can stay on the right track. This reflection is key in helping you craft the next set of daily and weekly “wins.” Giving yourself time to focus on the successes instead of just identifying problem areas will also keep you motivated, so be sure to write down your reflections somewhere in your planner or document. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

But what do I know? The company has announced it is holding its first U.S. awards show later this year. It seems the Oscars-ification of short form video is here.In a blog over on the TikTok site, the company said the show, fittingly called the TikTok Awards, will be held in the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles on Dec. 18, 2025, and will \"honor the creators who have inspired, entertained, and connected communities across the country.\"To that end, the site also says it will invite users to \"vote for their favorite creators\" starting on Nov. 18. So, how will all of this go down?\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWho is nominated for the TikTok Awards?TikTok says it will have announce nominees in 14 categories, including Creator of the Year, Video of the Year, Breakthrough Artist of the Year, and Muse of the Year, whatever that means. But don't assume you can put forward any old channel for an award.Towards the end of its announcement post, TikTok included a \"Meet the Nominees\" section that makes it clear the company has already chosen the competitors—and it might not be anyone you recognize. As someone who has spent a total of 13 hours on TikTok over last week (the things I admit for this job), I only recognize one of them.To be fair, the company says there are \"more to come,\" so it's possible someone I recognize will get added to the list of options. Regardless, it seems like the nominees are being chosen by some internal board, so your mileage may vary on whether you agree with the picks. Personally, I'll admit that a lot of my favorite channels are journalists, spicy comedians, and political commentators, so it's possible they're not showing up here due to an effort to appear apolitical and family friendly. (Justice for Dave the cat, though).You can vote Voting for the TikTok Awards will start on Nov. 18, and the company says you can cast your votes using the in-app TikTok Awards hub. While it's currently unclear how you'll find the hub, my guess is it will show up as a pop-up over your feed when you first open the app, as it did with prior TikTok giveaways. I'm sure nominated creators will also be quick to link users to the hub.It's unclear at the moment how many votes users will get to cast. Some sites, like Crunchyroll, like to let users vote on their awards once per day, likely to encourage engagement or discourage dummy accounts. Whether TikTok will implement a similar system remains to be seen.How to watch the TikTok AwardsIf all you want to know is who wins, then you'll be able to watch the TikTok Awards themselves live on Dec. 18 starting at 6 p.m. PT, with a \"red carpet livestream\" starting an hour before. If you're comfortable watching from your phone, you'll be able to tune in via the TikTok app, but for better TV integration, TikTok says Tubi will also host the program. If you happen to show up late, Tubi will also have an archive of the Awards available to watch on demand \"the next day.\"Can I go to the TikTok Awards In Person?While TikTok is promising \"an immersive IRL experience with interactive moments,\" it's not posting any links to purchase tickets, which means the event is likely invite-only. That's probably important for creator safety, but a bummer for anyone looking to help bring \"the For You Feed to life,\" as TikTok puts it.Are these really the First TikTok Awards?While 2025 is the first year the U.S. has had TikTok Awards, prior years have seen them come to countries including Korea, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. Likely, the delay has been due to the app's uncertain future in the U.S., but with a final deal now reached transferring control of the company to U.S. entities, it's likely TikTok is looking to make up for lost time by amping up its presence in the country.So, will you be watching the TikTok Awards? Personally, I'm not sure they jibe with what I like most about the app—there's a whole category celebrating people who sell via commission with the TikTok shop, something I immediately scroll by whenever I see it—but it could be a funny way to spend an evening, I suppose. So, basically the same approach I take with the Oscars—and at least it should make for some good hot takes on the accounts I do watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

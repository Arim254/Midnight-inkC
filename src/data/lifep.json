Once you add travel into the mix, it can feel impossible. Sure, hotels have fitness centers, but if you've ever gone to one only to learn it's nothing more than a few dumbbells and an ancient treadmill, you know how aggravating those can be. There are two apps I use to stick to my routine and prioritize my health while I'm on the road, but I use them quite differently. ClassPassAfter discovering last month that ClassPass houses a little-known, but varied, selection of at-home workout classes to stream, I happily re-downloaded the app for the first time in years. If you're not familiar, you buy monthly credits that you can redeem at gyms and fitness studios, trading a handful of credits for, say, a yoga or HIIT class. (You can also use it for salon and spa services, which is a cool upgrade that app has gotten since I last used it.)I used it all around my neighborhood in New York City for a month, checking out all the boutique studios near me, and found some I loved and others I was glad I didn't spend full price on a trial class for. But last week, when I was home visiting my mom in North Dakota, I checked ClassPass—and sure enough, yoga, barre, spin, and Pilates classes came up. I hadn't entirely expected it to work; it's one thing for a well-populated location like Manhattan to have a bunch of offerings on there, but Bismarck? Yes, Bismarck! I went to a barre class and it was awesome, exactly what I needed to stay on track with my workout schedule and destress after a disastrous night of airline mishaps. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn the next three months, I'm going to West Virginia, Nebraska, and Mississippi. That's how your vacation schedule looks when you're on a mission to visit all 50 states (and I only have eight to go). According to ClassPass, I'll be able to take a yoga class in Charleston, do HIIT in Omaha, and book time at a pickleball court in Biloxi. All of that beats a hotel fitness center by a mile. Even the smallest cities are well-represented on this app and you can get a real, full class experience wherever you are. PelotonI am a dedicated Peloton user and the app gets daily use from me, even if I'm only using it to track my outdoor walks. If you can't find the time or transportation to get to an in-person class, you have loads of options through Peloton, many of which can be completed in your hotel room, like yoga or stretching.There are guided walks available so you can take yourself on a mindful explorative journey around wherever you are, but you can also find loads of hotels that have Peloton cardio equipment. Usually, the Bikes or other equipment are in a fitness center, but I've seen hotels that even have them available in-room. Even if you can only devote 10 minutes to working out, it's better than nothing and keeps you in your groove, which is why I value the Peloton app so much. I did, of course, use it to track the barre class I took in Bismarck, plus the Les Mills Body Pump and Solidcore classes I took there, too. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nResearchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

As such, more than 20+ Disney owned channels have been pulled from YouTube TV. For more, read on here.Nothing says Halloween quite like an ominous countdown. Right now, subscribers to YouTube TV, the company's live TV service, are waiting to learn if they'll still have access to Disney-operated channels, including ABC and ESPN, come Oct.31. It's the latest conflict in ongoing fee disputes between Google and its various content providers, but even if Disney takes its ball and goes home, you won't be left entirely without options.When could Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV?According to Variety, if Disney and Google are unable to reach a deal by the end of Thursday, all Disney networks will vanish from YouTube TV on Oct. 30 at midnight ET. These include Disney Channel, ESPN, ABC News, Disney Jr., FX, FXX, FRXM, NatGeo, Freefrom, and even local ABC stations. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's not the first time YouTube has been through something like this. Last February, Paramount made a similar threat before eventually reaching an agreement that saw no pause in customer access to its channels. Since then, YouTube has had similar conflicts with Fox Corp., NBC Universal, and Univision, with only the Spanish-language network failing to reach a deal before its channels went dark.It's all about licensing feesWhat's happening here all comes down to licensing fees. To offer channels like the cable providers it's trying to replace, YouTube TV has to continually pay fees to content providers, and occasionally, those providers propose higher fees. That leaves YouTube in a bit of a lurch, as it tries to navigate between paying a fair price to its partners while also avoiding raising prices for its subscribers.Disney told Variety that, \"[t]his is the latest example of Google exploiting is position as the expense of their own customers,\" implying that Google was risking stripping away channels its customers had paid for by refusing to compensate Disney with \"fair rates.\" Google in turn argues that giving into Disney's \"costly economic terms\" would force the company to \"raise prices on YouTube TV,\" as well as leave the service in a rough spot when compared to Disney's own Live TV offering, Hulu + Live TV.What happens if a deal isn't reachedPersonally, I wouldn't take either company's statement too seriously, at least if the earlier Paramount and NBC Universal conflicts are anything to go by—there's a good chance a deal will be reached before YouTube TV subscribers are affected. But as with those earlier conflicts, YouTube is willing to make it up to its customers if they lose access to Disney content.\"If it [Disney content] remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit,\" YouTube said. That would be enough to subscribe to a month of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle with ads, although YouTube hasn't said if the credit will be recurring.Currently, a YouTube TV Base Plan starts at $72.99/month for your first three months, then jumps up to $82.99/month after that, making it slightly less expensive than Hulu + Live TV in the long term ($64.99/month for the first three months, then $89.99/month after that). Whether prices will stay the same if Disney pulls its channels remains to be seen.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

There's WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Signal, Telegram, and iMessage (if you're on iPhone), and that's just the dedicated chat apps. You might have to keep up with new messages on Instagram, TikTok, Threads, even Spotify. If I install one more app with a messaging feature, I'm going off the grid. As it happens, another non-chat app is joining this list. On Tuesday, Zillow—yes, Zillow—announced its app will also now support messaging. Starting today, you can send people messages in the app you use to look at houses you will most likely never actually buy. We live in interesting times, indeed. Of course, Zillow's goal here isn't to become the next WhatsApp. In fact, you can only choose to chat with one other person on Zillow—at least, that's the case for now. The idea of Zillow messaging is strictly to chat about listings you find through the app, without needing to leave Zillow to do so. The goal for most app developers is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, so there's a cynical case to make here for Zillow trapping its users within the app. If you don't move to another chat app to talk about a listing, you're more likely to interact with additional houses on the app. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut I actually see the logic here: If you're in a housing market with a lot of listings, you're probably firing off a number of them every day to interested parties—namely, whoever you're buying the house with. Keeping those conversations in the same app as those listings could be a smart way to keep track of all those houses, instead of the usual routine of \"wait, which house was that? I can't find the text you sent me.\" And the fact that Zillow is limiting this experience to one chat partner at this time means you're not going to be DMing a number of people about houses in your area. This does seem designed for people who are trying to buy a house together to do so with a bit more convenience.How to try Zillow messagingThis feature is live as of this article. To get started, open Zillow on your smartphone or in your web browser. On the app, tap \"Inbox;\" on the web, click your profile in the top-right, then choose \"Inbox.\"  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to start a chat, you need to invite the other person to join you. To do so, choose \"Invite now,\" which will pull up a pop-up about the feature. This screen explains the invite link is good for 24 hours, and that you can only invite one person for now. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nChoose \"Share invitation,\" and Zillow will let you share it wherever you'd like. You can copy the link, and paste it in another chat app, or choose a destination for Zillow to share the link to directly.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It's probably not the Halloween treat you were looking for, but now that the end of the month has come, that's exactly what's happened: Right now, more than 20 of Disney's channels have gone dark on YouTube TV.Why did Disney pull its Channels from YouTube TV?Not to be confused with YouTube Premium, YouTube TV is Google's Live TV service—kind of like cable without the cable box. As such, it needs to pay content providers like Disney fees to offer their channels, and that sometimes means disputes arise over how high those fees should be. While neither company has given insight into specific numbers, the gist seems to be that Disney wants to raise its fees, and Google doesn't want to pay up.It's a tough tightrope to walk. On Disney's end, the company told Variety that it feels like it's charging \"fair rates,\" and accused YouTube of potentially depriving its paying customers of channels they should rightfully be able to watch by not playing ball. On YouTube's side of things, the company argued that paying Disney's new rates would force it to \"raise prices on YouTube TV.\"Throw in that Disney has its own Live TV service, Hulu + Live TV, and there's also a potential anticompetitive angle at play, which Google was happy to point out, noting the proposed fee increase \"directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their [Disney's] own live TV products.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhich Disney Channels Have Been Pulled From YouTube TV?This isn't the first time YouTube TV has had to negotiate fees with content providers, and it's been able to avoid losing access to channels from the likes of Paramount, Fox Corp., and NBC Universal in the past. But with Disney negotiations falling through, this is one of the bigger losses of content YouTube TV subscribers have had to face in years. The full list of channels pulled from the service includes:ABCESPNESPN2ESPNUESPNewsDisney ChannelDisney JuniorDIsney XDFreeformFXFXXFXMSEC NetworkNat GeoNat Geo WildABC News LiveACC NetworkLocalishAdditionally, if you're on the YouTube TV Spanish plan, you've also lost access to the following channels:ESPN DeportesBaby TV EspañolNat Geo MundoWhen will Disney's channels come back to YouTube TV?If there's a silver lining, it's that the loss of Disney channels on YouTube TV probably isn't permanent. A similar blackout happened in 2021, for similar reasons, and lasted less than a week.That said, a direct timeline on restoring Disney's content to YouTube TV isn't yet available. In an update to its initial warning, YouTube said that Disney is \"now following through on their threat,\" and that \"we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV.\" As before, the platform also promised subscribers a $20 credit if Disney content \"remains off YouTube TV for an extended period of time,\" though it's currently unclear how long \"an extended period of time\" actually is. Notably, $20 is enough to subscribe to a month of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle with ads.On Disney's, end, a banner on the top of the Disney+ Help Center currently points users confused about losing access to the company's channels to a site called keepmynetworks.com, which suggests other ways of accessing Disney's TV content and urges disgruntled customers to reach out to YouTube directly, as well as post about the blackout on social media.Other Live TV services that offer Disney ChannelsWhile YouTube TV has lost access to Disney's content for now, other services continue to offer it, including Disney's own Hulu + Live TV. However, while Hulu + Live TV is cheaper than YouTube TV for the first three months ($64.99 vs. $72.99,) it is more expensive afterwards ($89.99 vs. $82.99).Because the content blackout is likely to be temporary, a potential short-term fix might be the Sling Orange plan, which offers day passes for $5 a pop, and allows access to ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPN4K, Freeform, and Disney Channel.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Vigni Michael - Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        To manage your inbox, you need dedication. You need a plan. You need acronyms. One such acronym is RAFT, which will literally keep you afloat in the sea of emails you receive every day. You can combine it with others, like LIFO and 4D to maximize its benefits, but first you need to know what to do with it on its own.What is RAFT email management?RAFT stands for the following: ReadActFileTrash.Easy! With this management system, you take the time to read an email first, then act on it however you need to—if you need to, that is—before either filing it away somewhere or deleting it. That’s basically all there is to it, but it works because it requires you to focus on each individual email and make an assessment right away, so you don’t miss anything.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nLike the one- and two-touch rules, this one does require you to open your emails as they come in. For me, that's the hardest part because it's a habit you need to build. This approach reminds me of a more broadly-applicable productivity technique I use often, which is the two-minute rule. When you think of something or are prompted to deal with it, handle it right away. Again, it's a habit that needs to be built up, but I like this approach for all kinds of productivity needs—and with RAFT, you have a clearly outlined series of next steps after you open it up. How to get the most out of RAFTTo maximize the benefits, you should combine this with another system or two. For instance, combine RAFT with the LIFO—last in, first out—method, which calls for you to answer your most recent emails before older ones. If you do this, you’ll always be acting on the most urgent needs instead of playing endless catch-up with things that you let slip by. If something from the past is truly important, you’ll get a follow-up email and you can RAFT then. Otherwise, stick with your most pressing, recent messages and read them, act on them, and file or trash them after that.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes to the acting part, you can call on the trusty 4D method to help you out. The four Ds are delete, do, delegate, or defer, and they refer to the four things you can do with any email. (Delete here is redundant, since “trash” is part of RAFT, but it’s good to reinforce the notion that useless emails should be nuked.) Either do what the email says or delegate it to someone who can, but keep the process moving swiftly. If you don’t end up forwarding it to someone else, delete it or defer (file) it. The main rule of RAFT is you have to do something with every message, not ignore it. As for the filing component of RAFT, make sure you have a great file system in place in advance. If you use Gmail, consider using labels as a more organized archive system, to make whatever you choose to file away more easily accessible. You can label these mini-archives by date, by project, or by whatever makes sense for your retrieval, but be consistent about it so you’re not just banishing all your dealt-with messages to an email limbo. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Not only do endless emails bog you down and keep you stuck in a loop of endless replies, but the stress of even having to wade through both the important messages and the junk is enough to make you avoid your inbox altogether. There's a reason \"answer emails\" is always the example I use for a tedious-but-important task when I'm explaining more complicated, detailed productivity techniques.But there are smaller techniques you can apply directly to email management, too. To stay on top of your work, school, and personal correspondence, you need a productivity plan, but it doesn't have to be intense: You can try the simple “touch” rules of inbox management.Start reframing how you think of every email you get and consider them each an immediate priority. Crucially, I only mean the email itself is a priority; if you think too hard about this, you'll get overwhelmed fast. You don’t have to do whatever task is outlined in it the moment it arrives, but you do have to open it. The “one-touch” rule is similar to the “two-minute” rule of productivity in that way: A task that takes less than two minutes to complete should be done right away.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nOpen the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. This method works best for people who get a lot of emails that aren’t necessary to respond to, like all-staff updates. The goal is to touch it once instead of coming back to it repeatedly and deliberating if and when you’ll respond or deal with it or instead of procrastinating, never opening it, and being unaware of its contents (or even existence) when you actually need to know what it said. Open it, take in the information, send feedback if necessary, and be done with it.The two-touch ruleIf you tend to have a lot of emails that need a response and the one-touch rule isn't working well, you can move on to a “two-touch” method to clear your mind and be more productive. On the first touch of the email, decide if you need to respond to it right away (making it one-touch) or it’s something that can or should be responded to later in the week.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse your email service’s flagging or snoozing functions to categorize it, so it is available to you easily when you’re ready to respond. Your first touch is still opening it right away—that’s key. Letting emails pile up is overwhelming, but opening them right away will help you maintain peace in your inbox. Designating a specific time to respond to non-urgent messages will also free you up to be more productive, as you’ll know you’ll get it done and won’t feel it weighing on you. Make sure you schedule time into your week to circle back on the flagged emails. Try building a 3-3-3 list to manage your to-dos, designating one of your three medium-sized or small tasks to opening all those saved messages.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        You can do a lot with Android Auto, but what you can't do is install a web browser—at least not with the default, out-of-the-box configuration. It is actually possible to get a window on to the web with a little bit of tweaking, and the help of the open source AA Browser built especially for Android Auto.Getting a web browser up on your car dashboard may not seem like much of an improvement over browsing on your phone screen, but it also enables another feature on your vehicle's display: video playback. Through AA Browser you can get at pretty much any streaming site you want and load up some video.Some serious safety warnings are required here, though. You should only load up videos on your car's Android Auto screen when you're parked, stationary, and not going anywhere. Watching anything on the move—whether it's on your phone or on your vehicle dashboard—not only risks your life, it risks the lives of everyone else on the road with you.In fact, AA Browser will disable itself while your vehicle is moving, but it's worth giving out the warning in any case, for this and any other app. With that out of the way, here's how you can load up a web browser on Android Auto, and make your parked-up time inside your car more entertaining.Browser setup and installationLike Android as a whole, Android Auto has a developer mode that gives you access to a selection of extra settings. From Settings on Android, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixels) or just Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy phones). Scroll down to the bottom of the screen, tap Version, then tap Version and permission info seven times.You should then see a pop-up asking you if you're sure you want to enable developer settings for Android Auto, so tap OK to confirm. You then need to open up the AAAD (Android Auto Apps Downloader) app APK in your phone's browser, tapping through the security warnings about running non-Play Store apps on your device if they show up.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            AAAD will give you access to the AA Browser.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAAAD gives you access to a selection of Android Auto apps that haven't been specifically approved by Google, including AA Browser. Tap through the various introduction screens, give the app the permissions that it needs to install other apps, and then find AA Browser in the list of available apps. Tap Install and then tap through the confirmation pop-ups to get the app on your phone.You'll be asked if you want to open AA Browser straight away: You can use it as a normal web browser on your phone, though there's not really much to look at. It's designed to be used primarily on your Android Auto screen, and it should now show up as an available app when your phone is connected to your vehicle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsing AA Browser in your carProvided you're safely stopped in your vehicle, you can launch AA Browser from the main apps list on the Android Auto interface (you may also get a prompt to launch it the first time you connect, after installing the app). You get taken to the Google Search homepage to begin with, and from there you can go anywhere you like.As with any other Android Auto app, if you tap inside an input field, you'll see a keyboard pop up on screen that you can use to enter web addresses and login credentials, and you can use the touchscreen to navigate around. To get to the URL address bar, tap anywhere on screen, then tap the blue arrow in the lower left corner.\n    \n            \n            Entering and editing URLs in AA Browser.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe next screen also gives you options for going back through your browser history and accessing your bookmarks—a handy way of making sure you can jump back to the sites you need without having to tap our their URLs every time. There's also the option to request the desktop versions of sites rather than the mobile versions.While certain sites don't seem to like the AA Browser, most of the pages I've visited work fine on Android Auto. To quit the browser, you can either tap the Exit button in the top right corner (if it's visible), or swipe up or down from the top or bottom edges of the Android Auto screen to go back to your other apps.\n            ",

The messages originate from a legitimate PayPal address, allowing them to evade some security filters and leave recipients worried that their accounts have been compromised—perhaps just enough to ignore the obvious red flags and call or email scammers back. I personally have been targeted by this scam with at least five separate emails, though all have gone straight to my spam folder. Here's how scammers are exploiting PayPal settings to land in your inbox. How the PayPal scam worksIf you're targeted by this campaign, you may receive an email with the subject line \"Your automatic payment status has changed\" or \"Recurring Payment Reactivated.\" The layout imitates a real PayPal notification and includes a message about a high-dollar payment being \"successfully processed\" along with a customer service email and phone number to contact PayPal support. The email is full of red flags: It is addressed to a random name (or, in one of the messages I received, \"Hello Update Invoice\"), has poor spelling and wonky formatting, and simply doesn't make sense. You can easily spot oddities like bold text and Unicode characters, which BleepingComputer notes is a trick used to bypass spam filters and keyword detection. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nWhere the trick lies is in the sender field, as the email comes from service[at]paypal[dot]com, a legitimate PayPal address, and paypal.com is in the signed-by field. As Malwarebytes Labs describes, this is likely an abuse of PayPal's subscription billing feature. If a merchant pauses a customer subscription, the user will receive an automatic email from PayPal notifying them that their payment is no longer active. Scammers are likely setting up fake subscriber accounts using Google Workspace mailing lists, so automatic emails being generated are sent to everyone on those lists. If you look at the \"To:\" field, you'll see that the message isn't actually addressed to your email. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nExploiting these types of loopholes to make phishing emails seem legit is a common tactic, and I've covered several similar PayPal phishing campaigns already this year. According to a statement provided to BleepingComputer, PayPal is working on mitigating this specific flaw. Ignore PayPal payment notificationsIf one of these PayPal messages lands in your inbox, don't engage with it. Scammers frequently use emails, texts, and calls about account security and financial transactions to scare you into action, and the impersonation of trusted institutions is often pretty convincing. If you are concerned about activity on your PayPal account, go directly to the app or website and log in to view alerts and check transactions. Do not use contact information or click any links in the original notification, as this increases the chances of compromising your information or downloading malware to your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.If AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good. Then, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)How to AirDrop with strangers using AirDrop codesHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction. As stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed. \n            \n    ",

I make a handful of new, curated, choreographed ones for the spin classes I teach every week and otherwise meticulously maintain quarterly playlists designed to represent the overall vibe of specific, three-month periods in my life. I only edit those during the 12 weeks of the quarter, then leave them alone so I can revisit them and relive the era. This means I am constantly fiddling with the present playlist to make it just right, searching for songs that feel precisely aligned with however I'm feeling. It's actually a time-consuming hobby—but I stumbled across a feature the other day that has made creating spin playlists and soundtracking Q1 of 2026 easier than ever. The best way I can describe the feature I stumbled upon is that it's like Tinder for songs. If you're listening to a song within the app, scroll down. Go past the buttons for Play and Next, past the About the artist section, past the lyrics, and stop when you see Explore [artist name]. Then, you'll have three options like Similar to [artist name] and Similar to [song name], but these can differ slightly. Tapping one of those opens up the new feature. Say you choose Similar to [song name]. You'll be given 30 seconds of a song that Spotify's algorithm considers \"similar\" to the one you were just listening to, plus the artist's name, how many Spotify followers they have, and a three-dot menu that will let you add the song to your likes, add it to a playlist, go to the artist's page, and more. If you like the 30-second clip, you can add the song to your playlists. If not, you can keep swiping downward to hear a new one. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSee how it's like Tinder? You make fairly snap decisions based on the quick preview and few details you get, then swipe away if you don't like it. I found a community forum post on Spotify's website about it, but otherwise, not much chatter. All I can tell is that it's been out since about May. Why I like the featureI prefer this to the other music-discovery options on Spotify because it gives you a quick preview of the song and makes the finding process simple. I am, of course, a big fan of the pre-generated Discover Weekly playlist or New Releases playlist Spotify makes for me every week, but it's time-consuming to listen to all the songs in them and it's not intuitive to find other new songs based on the finite playlists themselves. The 30-second quick hits and easy, swipeable dismissal of the new feature help me figure out if a song is worth my time, either for spin class or personal use, add it to the appropriate playlist if so, and keep moving. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat I especially like is the three hashtags under the artist's name. They are genre descriptions that match up with whatever song you're previewing and I've found them helpful because I have a hard time describing what kind of music I even like. Apparently, per the new feature, I like something called \"speed garage.\" Tapping the #speedgarage hashtag that appears in the song previews brings me to another scrollable preview pane full of, exclusively, more speed garage—whatever that actually is. I still can't define it, but I learned I like it, and that alone is more beneficial than a year's worth of Discover Weekly playlists. I used this feature during my Uber ride to the airport the other day and, by the time I was through TSA, I had 29 new songs in my Q1 playlist. I listened to them on the plane, weeded out ones that didn't match the quarterly vibe well enough, then sent it to my friends, who all gave the collection rave reviews like, and I quote, \"this slaps.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        The holidays are for rest, relaxation, and eating your weight in cookies shaped like reindeer. Your fitness goals can absolutely wait until the new year. But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.These are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed. Tactical door-closed push-ups (10-15 reps)These are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.Spite squats (20 reps)Do some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking. Frustration lunges (10 per leg)Lunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes! \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.Diplomatic plank hold (30-60 seconds)Hold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPassive-aggressive mountain climbers (30 seconds)Quick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor. Peacekeeper glute bridges (15-20 reps)Lie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.Zen bicycle crunches (20 total)Finish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center. Cool downSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.\n            ",

ANC has a time and a place, but being able to be aware of my surroundings and have conversations with my wife while working from home has made 2025 more enjoyable. I owe that to the Shokz Open Run Pro 2, which are bone conduction headphones that leave your ears uncovered. But if you prefer true wireless earbuds that have the same benefit, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are a great alternative, and right now, they're on sale for $139.95 (originally $199.95).\nUnlike the Shokz Open Run Pro 2, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are not bone conduction headphones; instead, the sound is projected toward your ears (think of it like small speakers next to your ears). This means, like bone conduction headphones, your ears are not plugged by any earbuds. They simply rest on them, allowing you to use your ears to their full potential. The OpenFit 2+ comes with some cool features. They have Dolby cinematic sound, which is an immersive sound feature that frees sound channels, making directional sound clearer (almost like surround sound). If you like to watch movies or shows with your earbuds, this is a huge plus. The design fits snug on your ears, so you don't have to worry about them falling off, regardless of how intense your workouts get.

Anker's Soundcore Sleep A20 are exactly that: earbuds designed to block out excess noise without pressing uncomfortably against your ear. I've been using them for a year and can't recommend them enough. Right now, these sleep earbuds are on sale for $107.99 (originally $179.99)—that is the lowest price they've been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe Sleep A20 are not active noise-cancelling earbuds, which is how they're able to have such a small, unobtrusive form factor. Instead, they use the in-ear seal to create a natural noise blocker, which, in my opinion, works well enough to block out sounds. They fit quite comfortably and don't press against your ear when you sleep on your side. Very rarely do I wake up with one of them lost in the covers after falling off during the night, but it does happen occasionally (you can use the Find Device feature, which emits a loud sound through the earbuds). The battery life is 14 hours on sleep mode, which includes sounds from the Soundcore app (think white noise or relaxing sounds). If you have it in Bluetooth mode, where you can listen to Spotify or whatever else you want, the battery will last eight hours, but the charging case gives it a total life of up to 80 hours between plug-ins.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe companion app is great, with many useful features for sleeping. You can turn your earbuds off after a set amount of time, have a sleep tracker that records your sleep data, a smart volume feature that increases or decreases in volume depending on the sound in your room, full EQ, and other features. \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whatever your reasons, you’re in need of a last-minute gift, and your options are limited. If you're reading this at a time when it's too late for online delivery, and in-person store options are already closed, then all that’s left is the glory of your local 24-hour drug store.If you have access to a major chain like Walgreens or CVS, you could be in surprisingly good shape for this last-minute gift. All it takes is a little ingenuity to level up this gift from \"a protein bar\" to \"a gym bro collection,\" or \"some loose nail polish\" to a \"curated at-home spa day.\"Following this logic, I’ve carefully categorized your gift options into three tiers. The first is for gift-givers willing to shell out a little extra cash in their panic in order to create something somewhat personalized. The second tier includes single-item purchases that are simply passable gift options. The third tier is a warning.Tier one: DIY signature collectionsLike a chef turning baskets of mystery ingredients into a three-course meal on Chopped, this category of gifts is all about your innovation. In these DIY arrangements, the sum is greater than its parts, which should all be available at most chain drug stores. Here are some of our ideas for themed collections, but feel free to customize at your convenience.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nMovie night: Popcorn. Funky popcorn toppings. Candy. Hot chocolate. Fuzzy socks. A little slip of paper with your Netflix login. You can’t go wrong with a cozy movie-night theme.Treat yo’ self: Think spa day materials, like face masks, nail polish, and bath bombs. Throw in a candle to help set the pampering vibe.Health and wellness: Browse around for gummy vitamins, supplements, protein powder, and whatever else catches your eye in the fitness aisle. Be warned: This one can quickly get expensive. The Jetsetter: Pick from the array of travel-sized must-haves, including ear plugs and perhaps even a neck pillow (with a note about how to wear it right). The Techie: Head to the electronics section and go wild with whatever gadgets are available and within your price range. Portable chargers and speakers are quality gifts in their own right. Tier two: It’s the thought that countsThese items aren’t necessarily bad gifts, but many will be easily detected as a last-minute purchase. The success of tier two drug store gifts will come down to the charm of the gift-giver and the chill factor of the recipient.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGift cardsCandlesCosmetic bagsTherapeutic massagerJewelryInsulated mugsCalendars or plannersNotebooksCoffee/tea bundlesWine and a corkscrew (depending on your state’s liquor laws)Picture framesElectronics, like ear buds or portable chargersTier three: “Gifts” that will do more harm than goodHey, buddy. All is lost, huh? Personally, I recommend a white lie about an imaginary gift that didn’t arrive in time.

Who would actually befriend an AI bot, let alone fall in love with them? Fast forward 12 years, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only do people love chatting with AI bots, they are actually developing deep connections with them. I still don't get it, but I can't deny it: People like these chatbots a lot.Part of what people like about conversations with generative AI is the \"personality\" of each bot—or, at least, its perceived personality. After all, ChatGPT isn't a monolith: You can adjust the bot to sound wildly different than it does on someone else's app, which raises some questions for me regarding these curated companions. But I digress: This article isn't necessarily a critique of how people are attaching themselves to ChatGPT; rather, I'm sharing the news that OpenAI is now giving you more control over how the bot sounds and responds in your conversations. Curate your perfect AI companion On Friday, OpenAI announced new controls for ChaGPT's \"Personalization.\" In a post on X, the company revealed that users can now adjust their chatbot's \"characteristics,\" or, in other words, its overall personality. These are adjustments to the personality types that OpenAI has already let you choose from, which include one of eight options: \"Default\" (preset style and tone); \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Friendly\" (warm and chatty); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative); \"Efficient\" (concise and plain); \"Nerdy\" (exploratory and enthusiastic); and \"Cynical\" (critical and sarcastic).  \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nBut no matter which of these personalities you pick, you now have four \"characteristics\" to adjust to fine-tune the overall experience. There's \"Warm,\" \"Enthusiastic,\" \"Headers & Lists,\" and \"Emoji,\" with the option to have more or less of each, or the default amount, as OpenAI sees fit. For Warm, you can either have ChatGPT be friendlier and more personable, or more professional and factual. With Enthusiastic, you can choose the bot to have more energy and excitement, or be calmer and more neutral. \"Headers & Lists\" lets you choose between clear formatting and lists, or more paragraphs. And, of course, you can control whether ChatGPT uses more emoji, or fewer, depending on your sense of fun and joy. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs usual, you can take advantage of custom instructions to guide ChatGPT's personality in a direction you like, especially when the presets don't give you those options. For example, if you'd like ChatGPT to talk to you like a pirate, or if you want it to end every response with a certain catchphrase, here's your chance to influence the bot. I'm really not someone who uses ChatGPT outside of testing it for coverage, so I can't speak to whether these additional controls are useful. But if you want to try making your version of ChatGPT your ideal \"AI companion,\" the controls are at your disposal. You'll find these options wherever you access ChatGPT. You can either access it from Settings > Personalization, or from the Personalization shortcut in the ChatGPT menu.  \n            \n    ",

Case in point: The cordless blower/inflator.This tool is exactly what it sounds like. Shaped like a power drill, it simply...blows air (though sort of like a handheld leaf blower, these tools typically come with an array of nozzles to give you a bit of precision with the flow of your forced air). You might think this sounds like a tool you’ll never actually need, because you have lungs. But I'm here to convince you that you're wrong: A cordless blower will absolutely be one of the most useful tools you ever acquire.\nOne tool, many usesHandheld blowers have a lot of uses that make every DIY job you do a little bit easier and faster:\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nCleaning. Probably the most common use case for a blower is to quickly clean a work area by blowing away dust, sawdust, clippings, shavings, and other small debris. You can use a blower to quickly clear off a workbench, blow dust out of keyboards, engines, or anywhere else. This is also really useful if you have a tight spot where you can’t fit a tool—the blower can clean it out in a jiffy. It’s also useful for a quick cleanup on outdoor furniture or even my deck—while you might want an actual leaf blower for full-scale yard cleanup, a handheld blower can do an adequate, quickie cleanup on demand.Shortening drying times. If you’re waiting on something to dry out before you can move on to the next stage of your project, a blower can speed up that drying time considerably.Cooling other tools down. There’s nothing more irritating than an overheating tool that forces you to stop and wait for it to return to a safe operating temperature. A blower can speed up that process, acting as a high-powered fan with a very precise, narrow blast of air to cool down hot components.Redirecting dust and debris. When working inside, you often want to use a vacuum to collect dust as you work, but outside, a small, handheld blower can be more convenient. Using it to redirect dust and debris away from you as you work can keep grit out of your eyes and your workspace clean as you go.Inflating stuff. These blowers come with attachments that not only allow you to be as narrow or wide with your airstream as needed, but also fit into standard nozzles. Need to inflate an air mattress, pool ball, or anything else? The blower will make short work of it.Once I started using a blower while I worked, I found myself reaching for it constantly just to keep my workspace clear of dust, and then I started grabbing it literally any time a blast of air seemed helpful. You might not think you need a blower in your tool chest, but you probably do.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChoosing a blowerMost cordless blowers are similar in terms of shape and function. The two from major brands you’ll come across most are Milwaukee’s M18 18V Brushless Cordless Precision Blower and Makita’s 18V LXT Brushless Cordless High Speed Blower/Inflator. They’re both solid tools, but I prefer the Makita because, in my experience, its battery life is much better (the Milwaukee has a bit more power, but I’ve never had a scenario where I needed more power). The Makita tends to last 45 minutes to an hour on a single charge, but when I borrowed a Milwaukee it died about a half hour into the job. Obviously, this will depend on a lot of variables, including what you’re using it for, but the Makita wins for me because every time I grabbed it there was enough charge left to finish the job.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.  Lookalike domains contain malicious contentThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes. In some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware. Infoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to avoid parked domain scamsOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site. I've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Following the major image editing upgrades added to Google Gemini back in August—under the whimsical codename Nano Banana—it's OpenAI's turn to supercharge the tools you get for image manipulations inside ChatGPT. The new update is called GPT Image 1.5, and is rolling out now for all users.One of the key improvements here, as was the case with Nano Banana, is the way that ChatGPT can now edit a specific part of an image while keeping everything else consistent. You can add or remove something, or change the color or style of something, without ending up with an entirely different looking picture.Another feature ChatGPT has now borrowed from Gemini: the ability to combine multiple images together in one scene. Want you and your best friend in front of Sydney Harbour Bridge? No problem—just supply the source pictures and the AI will do the rest. You can also change visual styles while maintaining consistent details.OpenAI says the new image editor and generator is able to follow instructions \"more reliably,\" and render pictures up to four times faster than before. Text can be more varied in style and size, and images should be more realistic and error-free in general—though OpenAI also admits there's still room for improvement.It's the best image generator tool we've ever seen in ChatGPT, and it all looks impressive at first glance—but how does it stack up in practice against Gemini and Nano Banana? I put the two models to the test via the $20-per-month plan on both platforms (that's ChatGPT Plus and Google AI Pro, respectively) to see how they compared.Rendering and editing imagesOpen up ChatGPT on the web or on mobile and you'll see there's a new Images tab on the left-hand navigation pane. This takes you to a library of your existing pictures, together with some new prompts for creating images. You get some suggestions for prompts, plus an assortment of preset portrait image styles you can apply.\n    \n            \n            A journalist, lamp, and countryside scene courtesy of Gemini.\n                                        Credit: Gemini\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            A journalist, lamp, and countryside scene courtesy of ChatGPT.\n                                        Credit: ChatGPT\n                    \n    \nI tested out the new GPT Image 1.5 model by getting ChatGPT to generate a busy tech journalist, a lamp in the middle of an empty warehouse, and a cartoon-style rolling landscape of hills in the fog. I then got Gemini to create the same pictures with the same prompts. While the results were pretty varied, in terms of quality and realism they were pretty equal—the occasional issue with weird physics and repetition, but nothing too bad.Both ChatGPT and Gemini are now quite competent at clean image edits, too: Both AI bots seamlessly switched the journalist's clothing to a shirt and tie without touching any other part of the picture. This would have taken a significant amount of time to do manually, even by a Photoshop expert, and shows just how transformative AI imaging is becoming.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n Color changes were all handled with aplomb, but the AIs struggled a bit with perspective changes, where I asked to see the same shot from another angle. In these cases, instructions were less well-followed and the images were less consistent (as new areas needed to be rendered), though ChatGPT did a little better than Gemini at getting good results.\n    \n            \n            Clothing can now be swapped out in seconds (Gemini edition).\n                                        Credit: Gemini\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            Clothing can now be swapped out in seconds (ChatGPT edition).\n                                        Credit: ChatGPT\n                    \n    \nThe classic \"remove an object from this picture\" challenge was handled with aplomb: Both Gemini and ChatGPT were able to remove a cottage from the countryside scene with surgical precision, leaving everything else intact. Again, these are the kind of time-intensive image edits that would previously have needed a lot of careful effort, and that can now be done in seconds.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Gemini's attempt at removing a cottage.\n                                        Credit: Gemini\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            ChatGPT's attempt at removing a cottage.\n                                        Credit: ChatGPT\n                    \n    \nCombining and remixing imagesAnother talent ChatGPT and Gemini now have is being able to combine images together. So you can have separate photos of you and your parents, put them together in the same shot, and then add in a background of wherever you like. You can get perfect family photos without actually gathering together your relatives together or going anywhere.This was an area where Gemini and ChatGPT did struggle a bit more: The editing dexterity was still impressive, but the results didn't always look like a single, coherent scene. Lighting is sometimes off, or elements from different images appear at different scales, and you'll have to do a bit more tweaking and editing and reprompting to get everything right.ChatGPT did fare slightly better at blending different images and elements together, and changing the overall look of a picture. When I tried to get the AIs to mix all my images together in a moody film noir shot, ChatGPT produced something pretty consistent—the Gemini effort looked a lot more like a cut-and-paste job.It can be fun remixing photos again and again—adding new people, changing the weather, moving the location—and both these bots are now capable of some rather incredible results. Remixing photos of family and friends will be popular, but it's not all that easy: With people you know, any generative AI that gets added tends to look wrong, because neither ChatGPT nor Gemini knows exactly what these people look like, how they smile, how they're built, or how they tend to stand or sit.\n    \n            \n            Gemini can combine images—but they look like different images.\n                                        Credit: Gemini\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            ChatGPT did a better job at creating a new image that looked correct.\n                                        Credit: ChatGPT\n                    \n    \nIn terms of ChatGPT vs. Gemini, they're both at a high level now—a level that puts advanced Photoshop-style editing capabilities at everyone's fingertips. If either AI model has the edge right now, it's ChatGPT's, but there's not much in it. It's also going to be fascinating to see where these image editing capabilities go next.\n            ",

than AirPods. AirPods sync between all your Apple devices, sound great, and ship with features like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a> and even a heart rate monitor. The problem comes, however, if something happens to your buds—especially when your battery starts to lose its capacity to hold a charge. Unlike your iPhone, whose battery is easily replaceable, AirPods aren't simple to repair. As it happens, they might not be repairable at all.  </p><p>It seems that hasn't changed with Apple's latest earbuds, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/airpods-pro-3-are-more-forgiving-for-the-tine-eared\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 3</a>. iFixit put the newest AirPods Pro through a teardown test to see how repairable they might be. The result? A whopping zero out of 10: totally unrepairable. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"airpods-pro-3-cant-be-fixed\">AirPods Pro 3 can't be fixed</h2><p>There are a number of issues in the AirPods Pro 3's design that lead to iFixit's declaration here. Chief among them is that Apple chooses to seal the entire casing with strong glue. In order to open up the buds, you need to heat them to loosen that glue, then pry the buds open with sharp tools. You need to both avoid melting the plastic of the earbuds themselves, while also trying hard not to disfigure the case while slicing it open. It's a tough balancing act. </p><p>Once inside, however, the trouble only continues. The battery is also held down with strong glue, so, once again, you need to apply heat without melting the earbud itself. Even if you successfully remove the battery, it's extremely difficult to reassemble all of the elements here—or to, god forbid, attempt to <em>replace</em> one of those elements should they break. Apple has designed these earbuds to pack a ton of tech into a <em>tiny</em> package, with both glue and soldering, which means you run the risk of destroying crucial components when moving them around. It's all too easy to accidentally ruin the microphones or noise cancelling tech here.</p><p>The same goes for the stem of the buds, and even the AirPods Pro 3 case: Both are all glued up, and are too easy to destroy while attempting to open or fix a component. In fact, iFixit says these \"repairs\" are so difficult, many repair shops don't even bother. Between the need for special tools and the risk for failure, they simply forgo AirPods repair attempts.</p><p>This nothing new for AirPods. According to iFixit, all of Apple's previous Bluetooth earbuds have the same problem. As it happens, all AirPods models—save for the AirPods Max—have achieved a zero out of 10 on iFixit's scale. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"are-there-repairable-earbuds\">Are there repairable earbuds?</h2><p>While many other earbud brands score better on the repairability scale, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/wireless-earbud-repairability-scores\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">many also don't fare much<em> </em>better</a> than AirPods. Scroll through iFixit's list, and you'll find other scores ranging from zero to three out of 10. It seems a lot of companies follow Apple's lead here and solder their batteries and components together with glue. </p><p>Still, there are some winners here, according to iFixit. The undeniable champ comes are the Fairphone Fairbuds, which scored a perfect 10 out of 10. The batteries in the earbuds are easy to replace, the case is modular and easy to disassemble, and Fairphone offers replacement parts and instructions. Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live are the runner-up with an eight out of 10: They're similarly repairable to the Fairbuds, but they don't have official repair instructions or parts, other than the batteries for the earbuds. Sony's WF-1000XM4 scored a respectable seven out of 10, as they also have easy to replace batteries with a modular case—though they don't include official parts or instructions.  </p><p>If your primary goal when buying earbuds is repairability, you do have options out there. If you want the best possible experience when using your Apple devices, AirPods are still where it's at. Just know that when something fails, such as the battery or another component, your Apple earbuds are kind of toast. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

finally answered my biggest (yet perhaps pettiest) complaint about its iconic smart ring—it’s now getting a battery-powered charging case so you can top up the battery when you’re away from your home. There are also new ring colors available, and finally, multi-ring support so you can switch between rings.</p><p>In addition, Oura has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251001647209/en/URA-Debuts-Groundbreaking-Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-in-Striking-New-Colors\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>announced</u></a> Health Panels, a feature that lets you book a blood draw at a Quest lab and view your results in the Oura app. Whoop <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-new-blood-testing-feature\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recently announced a similar feature</u></a>, and Ultrahuman launched its <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aBDqx8?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Blood%20Vision&short_url=aBDqx8&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=Blood%20Vision\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Blood Vision</u></a> earlier this year. </p><h2 id=\"why-im-excited-for-the-charging-case\">Why I’m excited for the charging case</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-ive-learned-from-four-years-of-tracking-my-health-with-the-oura-ring\" target=\"_blank\"><u>all the time that I’ve been using Oura rings</u></a>—since generation 2—the charger has worked the same way: You have a little circular stand that lives on your nightstand, and you set the ring on top of it, fitting it around a little cylinder shape that sticks up from the base. I’ve never loved this format; it’s too easy to send the ring flying if you catch your foot on the cord in the dark. It’s also not the most convenient for travel. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Now, however, the Oura ring has a charging <em>case</em>. The case holds about five charges’ worth of battery, so you can top up the charge on your ring by popping it into the case, then closing the case and sticking it in your pocket. Or gym bag. (Weightlifting workouts are my favorite time to charge the ring.) Traveling with the charger is now simple, and you don’t have to worry about losing the ring if the charger gets knocked over. </p><p>Now for the bad news: This puppy is $99, and it’s a separate add-on; you can’t get it in place of the nightstand charger when buying a new ring.</p><p>Like the nightstand chargers, it’s specific to the size of your ring. For example, you need a size 8 charger for a size 8 ring. The new charging case doesn’t seem to be available on Oura’s website yet, but it should be coming soon. (If you can’t wait, or want to save a few bucks, I found this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4lEo?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=third-party%20case%20that%20holds%20your%20nightstand%20charger&short_url=Qp4lEo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=third-party%20case%20that%20holds%20your%20nightstand%20charger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>third-party case that holds your nightstand charger</u></a>—either generation 3 or 4. It's not as sleek as the official one, though.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-now-swap-between-rings\">You can now swap between rings</h2><p>Today Oura announced a <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aRMGe7?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=new%20collection%20of%20ceramic%20rings&short_url=aRMGe7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=new%20collection%20of%20ceramic%20rings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>new collection of ceramic rings</u></a> in four different colors: white, navy, pastel green, and pink. The new rings have the same internals as the metallic Ring 4, so this isn’t a new generation of ring, just a new appearance. (Oura also notes that the ceramic rings should be more resistant to scratches, and each one comes with a polishing pad to keep its shine.) All colors are $499, the same price as the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWERb7?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=gold%20and%20rose%20gold%20finishes&short_url=QWERb7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=gold%20and%20rose%20gold%20finishes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>gold and rose gold finishes</u></a> of the regular Ring 4.</p><p>With so many color options, Oura seems to hope existing members will splurge on a second ring. The company is rolling out multi-ring support for the app, another feature I'm surprised they didn’t have before. (When I’ve tested the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-oura-4-vs-oura-3\" target=\"_blank\">gen 3 and 4 rings to compare</a>, I've had to completely reset my ring to switch over, or else use two different accounts.) Oura says you’ll need to select in the app which one you’re wearing, so it’s not quite as seamless as the way Garmin or Apple handles multiple devices. (Garmin has me choose a “priority device” and then I can switch at will; Apple just sets you free to swap as you like, and it does its best). </p><p>If you are done with your old ring after upgrading, Oura now has a <a href=\"https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/44414370533139-Device-Recycling-Program\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>ring recycling service</u></a> that gives you a shipping label to send back your old ring. Any Oura ring can be recycled through this program, including old or broken ones. (You should factory-reset the ring first.) Rings you recycle won’t be eligible for returns or refunds.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<article>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results\" target=\"_blank\">Take these steps</a></em><em> for better search results, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Besides measuring heart rate and other metrics like steps, pretty much every fitness tracker and smartwatch measures heart rate variability, abbreviated as HRV. This measurement is the basis for recovery scores and stress readings, and you can usually find it as a standalone measurement in the “vitals” section of your chosen app. So let’s break down what this number actually measures, and how to interpret yours. </p><h2 id=\"hrv-is-heart-rate-variability\">HRV is heart rate variability</h2><p>HRV stands for heart rate variability, but that doesn’t mean what you might think. HRV is <em>not</em> related to your heart rate changing throughout the day or during exercise. (Your heart beats faster when you’re exercising hard, which is what <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate zones</u></a> measure. Totally different purpose.) </p>\n<p>Heart rate variability refers to <em>how rhythmically</em> your heart beats. If the time from one beat to the next is always the same (at a given heart rate), you have low HRV. But if some heartbeats come more closely together, and some are more spaced out, you have high HRV. </p><p>This may be surprising, but you actually <em>want</em> your heart rate to show some variation. High HRV is considered to be better than low HRV. Your fitness app will say you’re well recovered if your HRV was higher than usual last night, and it will say you’re stressed or not recovering well if your HRV was low. </p><p>That said, it’s of course possible to have a heart rate that is <em>too</em> variable. In a sense, that’s what an arrhythmia is. When I’m talking about HRV here—and when fitness apps report your HRV—they’re considering the teeny tiny differences from beat to beat in an otherwise normal(ish) healthy(ish) person. </p><p>These differences are measured in milliseconds, and you wouldn’t notice them if you didn’t have a watch sampling data while you sleep. If you ever notice anything wildly strange about the rhythm of your heart, ask your doctor (or seek emergency medical help, if appropriate). </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-high-hrv-mean\">What does a high HRV mean? </h2><p>High heart rate variability (that is, high <em>for you</em>) tends to mean that you’re relatively relaxed and not too stressed. Fitness apps will bump up your readiness and recovery scores when your HRV measured during sleep is high. </p><p>The variation in beats is thought to come from the push and pull of two different body systems, the sympathetic (“fight or flight”) and parasympathetic (“rest and digest”) nervous systems. It’s normal for your brain and body to be balancing these needs, so this is considered a good, normal functioning. </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-low-hrv-mean\">What does a low HRV mean? </h2><p>Low HRV tends to occur when your body is working on something—recovering from hard exercise, fighting off a cold, experiencing lots of stress. If your HRV measured during sleep is low, you’ll get lower readiness or recovery scores. I find my HRV tanks when I’m sick or when I’ve been through a rough time either physically or mentally. (The day after a race or a weightlifting competition is always a low HRV day for me.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-good-hrv-number\">What is a “good” HRV number? </h2><p>I’ll give you some numbers in a minute, but the most important thing to know is that HRV is most useful when you compare readings to <em>what is normal for you</em>. Your HRV can be higher than mine, but still low for you, or vice versa. </p><p>So please don’t go around asking whether an HRV of 50 is “good.” Is it higher than usual <em>for you</em>? Then it’s good. Is it lower than usual for you? Then maybe it’s indicating that your body is under stress. If your typical HRV readings range from 35 to 50 (for example), then 50 is high for you. </p><p>It doesn’t matter whether the average person your age has a HRV of 20 or of 100; those numbers are just fun facts about the population in general. They don’t apply to you. Studies tend to show that fitter people have higher HRV, but also that HRV declines as we age. The average man’s HRV is slightly higher than the average woman’s, but the full range of what’s “normal” for each gender almost fully overlaps.</p><p>There’s one more important caveat: when you look up HRV data, you’ll find that different studies and different devices each measure HRV differently. For example, <a href=\"https://doctaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/A_Quantitative_Systematic_Review_of_Normal_Values_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this meta-analysis</u></a> found the average HRV was 42, with a range of 19 to 75, when measured as rMSSD (root mean square of successive differences). </p><p>So—and remember this is just for fun, here are some graphs from two wearable companies that publish their data <em>and</em> they both use rMSSD:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/normal-hrv-range-age-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Whoop’s breakdown of HRV data from their users</u></a> finds men have an average of 40 and women 37. They have graphs breaking down how this changes with age, and showing the variation for each group. </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/average-hrv/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Oura’s breakdown of HRV from their users</u></a> finds an average of 41 across all users, and they also graph it by age and gender. </p></li></ul><p>As I’ve found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-fitness-tracker-measure-hrv\" target=\"_blank\"><u>when comparing multiple devices on HRV</u></a>, devices don’t always report the same HRV numbers, but usually you can follow similar trends on all of them. If you’re sick, they’ll all report low HRV. If you have a good day, they’ll all report high HRV. So pay more attention to the trend than the specifics.</p>\n            </article>",

Today, performance wearable Whoop has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250930178710/en/WHOOP-Launches-Clinician-Reviewed-Advanced-Labs-Unlocking-a-Comprehensive-View-of-Human-Health?_gl=1*10pmvmu*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTc0MzcyMjMuQ2owS0NRandvUF9GQmhERkFSSXNBTlBHMjRQWTJfXzRVN2o3dGtxa0FNNjNYR2hQTVdOdFo1VjNGYm0wbGlpVmFNWFBLdU1UTnFYT2gyMGFBbi16RUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MzE0MTg4My4xNzU4NTgyMjgy*_ga*Njg5NzEzNzk1LjE3NDI1ODUwMTM.*_ga_ZQWF70T3FK*czE3NTkyMzYzNTQkbzcwJGcxJHQxNzU5MjM2NTM4JGozMyRsMCRoMA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">officially launched</a> Advanced Labs, a new feature that connects blood test results with the company's continuous health monitoring platform. <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/advanced-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Whoop Advanced Labs</a> is in partnership with Quest Diagnostics, adding to a growing trend of more and more wearables aiming to be comprehensive, one-stop health platforms. The launch comes after more than 350,000 members joined a waitlist following the feature's preview in May, signaling mighty strong appetite for this new level of integrated health tracking. </p><h2 id=\"how-whoop-will-track-bloodwork\">How Whoop will track bloodwork</h2><p>Whoop Advanced Labs is designed to analyze biomarkers spanning metabolism, hormones, inflammation, cardiovascular health, and nutrient status—all data that goes far beyond what can be captured through wearable sensors alone. \"At Whoop, we're committed to empowering our members with a highly comprehensive view into their health and performance,\" <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/press-center/whoop-to-bring-clinical-lab-testing-from-quest-diagnostics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">said John Sullivan</a>, Chief Marketing Officer at Whoop. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The vision is that Whoop subscribers will be able access the types of clinical testing that physicians order (like from Quest Diagnostics) to deliver patient care. Here are the two ways that members can bring their bloodwork into their fitness tracking:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Upload pre-existing bloodwork. </strong>Members can now upload results from any lab provider directly into the Whoop app at no additional cost. This is a way to centralize all results, track long-term trends, and connect bloodwork findings to data on sleep, training, recovery, and lifestyle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Book comprehensive testing through the Whoop app. </strong>Members who subscribe to Whoop Advanced Labs and schedule curated blood tests directly through the app. From there, results are automatically synced to the Whoops app and reviewed by a clinician who provides expert context. <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/advanced-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Subscription options</a> include: one test for $199, two tests per year for $349, or four tests per year for $599, with additional tests available at discounted rates. </p></li></ol><p>To clarify, a third-party provider will review test requests, order tests, deliver results through the Whoop app, and provide phone consultations when requested. All tests are reviewed and ordered by a licensed healthcare provider.</p><h2 id=\"do-you-really-need-to-monitor-everything\">Do you really need to monitor everything?</h2><p>Again, Whoop isn't the first wearable company to head in this direction. Ultrahuman, the maker of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ultrahuman-air-smart-ring-review?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">Ring AIR smart ring</a>, launched its <a href=\"https://www.ultrahuman.com/blood-vision/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Blood Vision</a> feature earlier this year. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>This feature can help people catch health issues early and take proactive steps to address them. At the same time, it raises questions about whether consumers actually need this level of health monitoring from for-profit wellness companies.</p><p>In my opinion, this all points to a sort of \"medicalization\" of everyday wellness. While access to health data can be empowering, it can also create anxiety and lead people to over-monitor aspects of their health that might not require constant attention. After all, blood biomarkers can fluctuate <a href=\"https://familymedicineandwellness.com/different-outcomes-knowing-why-blood-test-results-may-vary/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for many reasons</a>, and abnormal results don't always indicate health problems. </p><h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2><p>As this feature rolls out, anyone interested in Whoop's blood testing integration can still <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/waitlist/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">join the waitlist</a> for Advanced Labs. Whether you'll actually want to know everything your blood appears to be telling you is another question entirely. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/top/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Anecdotally</a>, the company's existing user base already skews toward serious athletes and health optimization devotees—in other words, the sort of people who would be interested in comprehensive biomarker tracking. For now, I've strapped in to watch the lines between fitness tracker and medical device continue to blur. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Smart home devices can streamline a lot of your day-to-day tasks. With an internet connection and some simple automations, you may never have to carry house keys, turn off the lights, or touch your thermostat again. But all of this convenience comes at a potential cost, as smart tech is vulnerable to attack by cyber actors, leaving your personal data and your privacy at risk. </p><p>Here's what you need to know to secure your smart home.</p><h2 id=\"is-your-smart-home-secure\">Is your smart home secure? </h2><p>The short answer: not by default. Smart homes have vulnerabilities at multiple levels, from the devices themselves, to your home network, to the physical endpoints, like your phone, that have access to and control over your Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\n<p>To start, IoT devices may have weak built-in security protocols or lack clear instructions to help users lock them down from factory settings, leaving them vulnerable to hackers, who may have to exert very little effort to access your data or spy on you. Wifi routers and smart home devices often have default credentials that are publicly available and therefore easy to get past—and  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/router-reality-check-86-percent-default-passwords-have-never-been-changed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">data show</a> that the vast majority of users have never changed their router admin password or adjusted any factory settings. If your home network isn't secure, nothing connected to it can be considered secure either. </p><p>Smart devices can also be integrated into botnets, allowing threat actors to conduct malicious activity like account takeovers and malware distribution using your home network. A recent instance of this was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign known as BADBOX 2.0</a>, which targeted off-brand consumer electronics manufactured in China. </p><p>Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), notes the digital divide may increase the risk for some consumers, who may seek out cheaper devices from low-cost manufacturers that have weaker security and far less to lose in terms of reputation if they are implicated in vulnerabilities as compared to major companies like Amazon. </p><p>Finally, security can be compromised if your physical devices fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you control your smart home using apps on your phone, a threat actor could gain access in the event said phone is lost, stolen, or hacked.  </p><h2 id=\"smart-homes-can-compromise-privacy\">Smart homes can compromise privacy</h2><p>Left unsecured, smart home devices can also put your privacy (and potentially your safety) at risk. Internet-connected cameras, from baby monitors to pet cams, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/can-someone-spy-through-webcam-or-phone\" target=\"_blank\">are vulnerable to hacking</a>, and threat actors can use them to surveil you and your home. This may include snooping on and tracking your movements, \"shoulder surfing\" to collect sensitive personal information from your devices, recording audio and video footage of your private activities, and sharing or selling live feeds on the dark web. (In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-baby-monitor-hacked-by-man-who-threatened-kidnapping-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a particularly alarming incident in 2018</a>, a hacker reportedly issued verbal threats toward a four-month-old child through a Nest-branded baby monitor.)</p><p>Your smart tech is also likely collecting a lot of information about you in the course of its normal activities—all of which could be exploited. For example, your robot vacuum creates and utilizes a map of your home's physical layout to know where to go, and usage patterns from various automations can be used to track your movements and confirm when you're away from home. </p><p>There's also the possibility that your smart home devices are compromising your data in ways you aren't aware of and haven't actively consented to. A <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-reveals-alarming-privacy-and-security-threats-smart-homes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2023 report from security experts</a>—led by the nonprofit IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University—shows that IoT devices may inadvertently expose personal information that can be harvested and sold to companies involved in surveillance capitalism. Researchers found that spyware apps and advertisers abuse local network protocols to access sensitive data, making it easier to profile users. </p><h2 id=\"no-security-standards-for-smart-homes\">No security standards for smart homes</h2><p>One of the biggest barriers to smart home security is that there isn't a single set of cybersecurity standards that companies have to follow, nor a centralized resource for users to research this information. Earlier this year—during the last few weeks of the Biden administration—the Federal Communications Commission launched the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">U.S. Cyber Trust Mark</a> voluntary labeling program to incentivize device manufacturers to improve security and help consumers buy with confidence. However, under the Trump administration, the agency later <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-cyber-trust-mark-ul-investigation-delay/758507/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">launched an investigation</a> into the program, delaying its rollout. </p><p>For now, consumers are left to do their own due diligence. In 2017, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation created a resource called <a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">*Privacy Not Included</a>, with reviews of products measured against \"minimum security standards\" and breakdowns of any privacy concerns. The site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last year, but you can still find detailed information about the privacy and security history of well-known smart home manufacturers like Amazon, Google, Wyze, and Ecobee. </p><p>Otherwise, Budington suggests simply searching the device you're considering (and the company that makes it) before buying, to see if researchers or users have reported any concerns. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-improve-your-smart-home-security\">How to improve your smart home security</h2><p>Securing your smart home starts with securing your internet connection via your router. Lifehacker has assembled a whole <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-make-your-home-security-system-and-wireless-network-safe\" target=\"_blank\">guide to protecting your home network</a>, but at the very least, you should change any default router settings—admin usernames, passwords, and network names—to something unique and not personally identifiable, and turn on encryption in your wireless security settings. Regularly check for updates, which provide patches for security flaws, and audit the devices connected to your network to identify anything suspicious and remove those you no longer use. </p><p>You can add another layer of security with a guest network set up specifically for your IoT devices. That way, if your smart devices are compromised, everything connected to your primary network (such as computers and phones with access to your personal and financial accounts) will be protected. </p><p>According to Budington, one way to further mitigate vulnerability is to reduce the number of devices with their own wireless connection, running them through a secure, centralized hub instead. Home Assistant is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/self-host-apps\" target=\"_blank\">self-hosted option</a> that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or a traditional PC or used with the plug-and-play Home Assistant Green. Hubitat also gives you local control over your device data and integrates with a variety of products, including those compatible with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-most-important-smart-home-decision-is-the-ecosystem-you-choose\" target=\"_blank\">Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter standards</a>. </p><p>Once your network is secure, you'll want to <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/securing-your-internet-connected-devices-home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">take similar steps</a> with each of your IoT devices. Change default usernames and passwords to unique, secure alternatives and enable all available security features, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, in the device settings. Ensure your devices (and any apps used to control them) receive automatic firmware updates. </p><p>You should also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-protect-your-privacy-when-using-smart-home-tech\" target=\"_blank\">check your device's privacy settings</a>, removing permissions that aren't essential for it to function and disabling features you won't use. For example, you could turn off location tracking on your smart thermostat and disable voice control for devices other than your voice assistant. </p><p>Finally, while we've focused mostly on digital threats, your smart home isn't immune to physical compromise. Be aware of ways your devices can be accessed, such as those installed on the exterior of your house, and ensure phones and tablets and the apps on them that control IoT devices are secured with a PIN or biometric authentication.</p><p>Remember that, by nature, anything connected to the internet is at least somewhat vulnerable to attack. You'll have to consider your own risk tolerance and weigh the convenience of having a smart device against the potential for it to be compromised—and your privacy along with it. You may find that there are some things that you simply don't need to automate, and therefore you can stick with the \"dumb\" alternative. </p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBGBC5PWJAAJJJHG350CH/image.fill.size_150x150.v1737570988.png\" alt=\"Photo of Emily Long\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Emily</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-october-3-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K68SAJARB6DP9MCHE0P6EXZY/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759084104.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-set-up-alexa-wishlist-alerts-for-prime-day\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GRM6DN5FBJ884KM2D6W12/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1699834542.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Alexa Echo Dot third and fourth generation\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>",

In many cases they can be operated remotely and work autonomously, so they can be taking care of the chores while you're out at work or on vacation.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Ecovacs Winbot W2 Pro Omni\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can get smart devices to wash your windows for you.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Ecovacs</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You <em>are </em>going to have to make an initial investment in the technology, and, for some devices, a rather sizable one. The argument can be made that hiring someone to do your cleaning is a better option than getting robots to do it: They might do a more thorough job, depending on the person and the gadget you're comparing them to, and you can give them more specific instructions. However, getting cleaners in does involve giving someone else access to your home, and finding a mutually convenient time. It will also be an ongoing expense.</p><p>There are a few more cons to consider. One is that a certain amount of tidying up and preparation work is often required before the robots can take over. You may have to pick up toys and clothes, for example, so the robot vacuum can vacuum. By the time you've done that, you might think it makes more sense to just do the whole job yourself.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roomba app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Many smart devices can be controlled via an app.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: iRobot</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>What's more, these gadgets require a certain level of maintenance: Depending on the device, you need to empty them out, supply them with power, water, and cleaning products, and perhaps even clean parts of them yourself. Like any piece of hardware, they will experience wear and tear, and will eventually need to be replaced.</p><p>There's one other consideration to think about, which is that manual cleaning is a great way to exercise. <a href=\"https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-023-04039-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Studies have shown</a> that domestic duties can give you enough of a workout to extend your lifespan and improve a host of different health markers, so you might want to use some of the time that these gadgets are saving you to head out for a run or for a session at the gym.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-cleaning-gadgets-you-can-buy\">The best smart cleaning gadgets you can buy</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to transform your home into one that cleans itself, you can automate a number of different processes using a number of different devices. There's plenty of choice out there, so the usual rules apply: Take your time to research the various options and the features they're offering versus their price, and find as many reviews as you can from people who've used them.</p><h3>Robot vacuums and mops</h3><p>This is the obvious place to start, as these are the gadgets that usually come to mind when you think of smart cleaning tech. You can find single-purpose devices that only vacuum or only mop, or devices that combine both functions.</p><p>While early models had their issues with reliability and cleaning power, the robot vacuums you can buy today are generally more impressive in terms of how clean they can get your carpets and floors. You'll find features like LiDAR and camera-powered mapping and obstacle avoidance, self-emptying capabilities, and auto-adjustments depending on what surface is being cleaned. </p><p>Often, everything these machines do can be organized through a companion app, so you can set the cleaners to work on a specific schedule, as well as set zones or rooms that are off limits. We're even starting to see robot vacuums that can <a href=\"https://vacuumwars.com/eufy-marswalker-omni-s2-ifa-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">climb up the stairs</a>, so they really can get your whole house vacuumed and mopped without an assist.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roborock Saros 10R\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>The Roborock Saros 10R comes with its own docking station.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Roborock</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>These cleaners can be a significant investment.

Using suction to work their way across windows, cleaning and drying as they go, leaving you with window panes free of dust and grime.

These pieces of hardware elevate clothes cleaning with a variety of useful and intelligent tricks, including the ability to adjust cleaning and drying cycles to the type and size of load, remote control via mobile apps, and a number of self-maintaining mechanisms.</p><p>A good example is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMkVn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20WM6700HBA&short_url=9YMkVn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=LG%20WM6700HBA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">LG WM6700HBA</a>, which will set you back $1,250. There's on-board AI assistance to work out the best cycles for the clothes you're washing, an automatic dispenser for just the right amount of detergent and fabric softener to cut down on waste, and remote operations and monitoring via the LG ThinQ app.</p><h3>Smart dishwashers</h3><p>Finally we have <strong>smart dishwashers</strong>, which use automated technology to give your crockery and cutlery a better clean than standard appliances might. The features are similar to those you'll find on smart washers and dryers: Sensing technology for understanding what's been loaded in and adjusting the cleaning accordingly, remote app control and smart home integration, and as much automated maintenance and self-cleaning as possible.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PJqd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bosch%20500%20Series&short_url=98PJqd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=Bosch%20500%20Series\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bosch 500 Series</a>, which is priced at $1,250 at the time of writing.

Devices like Ray-Ban Metas come equipped with speakers, a microphone, embedded cameras, and connectivity to your smartphone—all in a package that largely looks like a normal pair of glasses. That's great for enthusiasts who want a hands-free smartphone experience when out and about, but not so great for anyone who dislikes the idea of invisible cameras everywhere.There are two sides to these privacy worries. One is the personal angle. Many of us don't want the people around us shoving their smartphone cameras in our faces when we're out in public, but at least then we'd know we're being recorded. These embedded cameras are tough to spot unless you know what you're looking for, which means there's a feeling of always being watched by anyone walking past wearing glasses. On the other hand, there's the larger privacy concern that comes with the territory of a huge company like Meta. Just last week, we learned the company plans to bring facial recognition tech to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses with a feature called \"Name Tag,\" which would give the wearer insights into the people they encounter using Meta AI. Taken together, smart glasses pose an unprecedented privacy and security risk for those of us living our lives, when both our neighbors and law enforcement have the accessibility to spy on us without our knowledge. Of course, what can you do? If these glasses are legal, and they're relatively inconspicuous, how can you protect yourself from the average Ray-Ban Meta-wearing Joe? By the time you get close enough to tell whether or not they're wearing smart glasses, you're already in view of the camera.\n\"Nearby Glasses\" tells you when someone is wearing smart glasses in your areaEnter \"Nearby Glasses,\" a new app that spills the beans on smart glasses wearers near your location. As reported by 404 Media, the app is made by developer Yves Jeanrenaud, and scans for smart glasses' \"distinctive Bluetooth signatures\" (also known as \"advertising frames\") to identify them in your immediate area. Jeanrenaud was able to use a directory of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) manufacturers to build a list of smart glasses the app can scan for, including devices from Meta, Luxottica Group S.p.A, and Snap. If the app spots one, it sends you a push notification.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe app can't currently distinguish between smart glasses and mixed reality headsets, however. As such, you may get an alert saying there are smart glasses nearby, but because the app picked up the Bluetooth signals from a Meta Quest headset. That said, these are much easier to spot than smart glasses, and are far less likely to be worn inconspicuously in public spaces.    Nearby Glasses is available for Android today, on both the Play Store as well as Github. Jeanrenaud says an iOS port \"is in the making.\"\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.How the Google Forms job scam worksThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job. As Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials. \nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page. How to avoid phishing attempts on your Google credentialsAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms. This is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The feature is called Smart Reorder, and it allows you to automatically sort your songs by BPM (beats per minute) and key. This is great for those who want to gradually bump up the intensity of the songs they listen to.It's worth noting that this feature only works for playlists you've created or those you've mixed using the Spotify Mix feature, which lets you add or customize song transitions like a DJ would. Also, because Smart Reorder is an extension of Spotify Mix, you can't have one without the other. Spotify Mix hasn't yet been launched in all markets where the streaming service is present, including where I live, and as such, Smart Reorder isn't available in those regions yet. It's a shame, because I'm really excited to try it.How to use Smart Reorder in SpotifyIf you're a Spotify Premium subscriber, using the Smart Reorder feature is easy. Just open any of the playlists you've created or mixed, and tap the Edit button above the first song. Scroll to the bottom and select Smart Reorder. Spotify will automatically rearrange your songs by BPM, and you can tap the Save button up top to confirm the changes.\nSmart Reorder should be a very useful feature for people like me, who prefer workout playlists that slowly bump up in intensity. I like to hear high BPM songs towards the end of my gym sessions or runs, but that might not be ideal for everyone. Some types of exercises, such as spin workouts, might be better off switching between high and low BPM songs as the intensity varies, and Smart Reorder wouldn't be great for those use cases. Some users on Reddit also suggested that you should create a copy of your playlists before using Smart Reorder on them, since you can't automatically restore playlists to their original order if you end up not liking the changes after saving them. To duplicate a Spotify playlist, open the playlist and tap the three-dots button above the list of songs.

Alexa+ is like the old Alexa, but with new contextual abilities. Users can ask complex, multipart questions, as well as requests for tasks, like asking Alexa to book you concert tickets. If you've used a voice mode on chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, you're familiar with the concept—it's just now available on your Echo devices, too. Now, Amazon is letting you lightly customize the personality of your new AI assistant, offering the choice between concise, calm, and enthusiastic bots. On Wednesday, Amazon announced \"Alexa+ personality styles,\" a new feature that lets you customize how Alexa responds to queries and requests. At launch, Amazon is rolling out three styles for this experience: \"Brief,\" \"Chill,\" and \"Sweet.\" According to Amazon, Brief is the choice for users who want shorter responses that are more direct and to the point. There should be less flowery language that chatbots are known for, including small talk and \"extra conversation.\" Chill, on the other hand, aims to be an \"easygoing and \"relaxed\" personality, that emulates \"chatting with a laid-back friend.\" Amazon says users who add the Chill personality to Alexa+ will notice conversations are \"breezy,\" and Alexa+ should offer \"gentle guidance\" with requests. Sweet is your \"biggest cheerleader\": Amazon says this bot responds with warmth and enthusiasm, celebrating your successes, encouraging you, and transforming \"everyday moments into opportunities for positivity.\" (I just wanted to know the weather, Alexa.)You can hear a sample of each personality on Amazon's official announcement page, or use the embeds below. Amazon has uploaded Soundcloud links with a brief for each, so you can get a sense of the voice and style of all three. First, there's Brief, which just says, \"Operating efficiently\":\nNext, is Chill, which says, \"Life's treating me well. All systems are zen, and the digital universe is spinning in harmony\":\nFinally, there's Sweet, which says, \"Absolutely fantastic. I'm radiating pure joy, and ready to make your day incredibly amazing\":\nAmazon says each of these voices was created following five pillars: Expressiveness, which can be concise to verbose; Emotional Openness, which can be reserved to enthusiastic; Formality, which can be professional to casual; Directness, which can be diplomatic to blunt; and Humor, which can range from subtle wit to overt sarcasm. Each pillar has its own ranges, which informs each personality. For example, Amazon says that Brief is specifically concise, casual, and direct, with minimal humor, while Sweet is warm, emotionally expressive, casual, and encouraging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDespite the audio samples above, Amazon won't force you to stick with these default voices, either. You can choose a new personality style while, at the same time, swapping between the eight different voice options Amazon offers.How to try Amazon's new personality styles with AlexaAnyone with access to Alexa+—either through the Alexa+ subscription or a Prime subscription—can try these changes. Amazon says it made the process for trying new personality styles quite easy: You can just say \"Alexa, change your personality style.\" Alternatively, you can also find the options in the Alexa app. Select the device in question, then head to Device Settings > Alexa's Personality Style. To change the voice of your chosen style, head to your device's settings again in the Alexa app, then, under \"General,\" choose your voice.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?There's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products; anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch, though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking. Perhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\nFirefox's AI features are easy to opt out ofEarlier this month, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which dropped Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any. \nWhat AI features Firefox offers\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.Alt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.AI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.Link previews: Shows key points before opening a link. AI chatbot providers in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.If you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle. Once activated, not only will these features not appear, but Firefox will block any pop-ups or alerts pushing you to try existing or future AI features. Any Firefox users who aren't keen on AI features will want to check out this new controls menu once they update their browsers—though there are certainly more egregious AI features out there. Translations can be convenient, as can link previews. But I know I'd never want a chatbot in the sidebar of my browser. If I used Firefox as my main browser, I would definitely disable at least that feature, if not all of them. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The data breach itself isn't new—it was initially disclosed in January 2025, and Conduent has already notified millions of individuals whose data was compromised in the incident. However, the breach is now believed to be larger in scale than previously reported, possibly among the largest to affect healthcare. Who is Conduent? Conduent is a New Jersey-based business processing outsourcing (BPO) company that provides services like printing, payment, and document and claims processing to state and federal government agencies as well as large commercial and transportation organizations. According to the company's 2025 annual report, these offerings include disbursement of benefits, such as food assistance and child support, and administration of government healthcare programs (like Medicaid). For large corporations, services include workplace and unemployment benefits management. Conduent was spun off from Xerox in 2017 and now employs around 51,000 people worldwide. \nWhat happened with the Conduent breach?In January 2025, Conduent suffered an outage that was later confirmed to be the result of a \"cybersecurity incident.\" The disruption lasted several days, during which agencies across the U.S. were unable to process some benefit payments. While the breach was discovered in January, hackers reportedly gained access to Conduent's systems months earlier on October 21, 2024. The Safepay ransomware gang later took credit for the attack. While Conduent confirmed in April 2025 that client information had been stolen in the breach, it didn't begin notifying affected individuals until October. According to those notices, the compromised data included names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance policy information, and medical information. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow many people were impacted by the breach? The scope of the breach continues to grow, but the total number of individuals affected currently sits around 25 million. The greatest impact appears to be in Texas and Oregon, though residents in California, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico have also received notices. (For reference, the total number of users impacted by the 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare is now estimated at 190 million.) What to do if you were affectedIf you receive a notice saying your information was compromised, you should take every precaution to secure your identity: At a minimum, ensure your credit is frozen, and set up a one-year fraud alert on your credit files to prevent someone from applying for credit using your information. None of the notices we've seen have offered any type of credit monitoring or identity theft protection services to affected individuals, but you could utilize these services as well. At this point—given the ubiquity of data breaches and information compromise—you should be keeping a close eye on your credit report and financial accounts at all times to quickly catch anything suspicious. If you do find fraudulent activity, report it to your bank and/or credit issuer immediately, and file an identity theft report. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

He has a bachelor's degree in English Literature from Durham University, where he also spent a term as editor of the award-winning student newspaper Palatinate. His journalism career started in print media, where he contributed to and edited several technology magazines and bookazines sold in the U.K. and internationally.

On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.If you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n    \n            \n            You can mute some or all of your phone's notifications when driving.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.On both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.Other Android Auto notification settingsAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.When you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.There are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n    \n            \n            You can control how messages appear on your dashboard.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.It's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.You should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited. As reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.If you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jake Peterson\n                    \n    \nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

In fact, one of these new features seems like a significant step forward for AI on smartphones: the ability for Gemini to handle multi-step tasks on an Android phone. The examples Google gives are booking a ride through Uber or reordering a meal on DoorDash, where the AI takes care of everything in the background, leaving you free to worry about, well, whether it's going to work.Google wants Gemini to perform tasks on your behalf  \"When you're working on a repetitive daily task, it's easy to daydream about handing it off to someone else,\" explains Google in the announcement blog post. \"Now, we're showing an early preview of what's possible.\" Understandably, this has a \"beta\" label as well as an \"early preview\" label attached, and it's initially only going to be available on Galaxy S26 phones and Pixel 10 phones (the Pixel 10a misses out). It'll also be limited to the U.S. and South Korea to begin with.As per Google, the process will be tightly controlled: Automations begin with your voice command and end as soon as the task is finished. Live notifications will keep you updated throughout, and you can jump in and take manual control at any time. What's more, the app is run in a \"secure, virtual window\" on your phone, with restricted app access.\nIt's going to be interesting to see how well this works. If it works well, this feels like a notable moment in getting AI to actually do mobile tasks for us. It's not clear if Google needs third-party app permission for this, but for now the feature will be available \"for select apps\" in the food, grocery, and rideshare categories.Google is upgrading Circle to Search and Scam DetectionNext, Google is upgrading Circle to Search on Android, the feature that lets you circle anything on screen and run a search from it. Circle to Search can do everything from find you a lamp online to warn you about a phishing scam.Now, Circle to Search will be able to search multiple elements on screen at once. It might be different pieces of furniture in a room, or different items of clothing in an outfit. You don't actually make the selections yourself: You just circle the relevant area (or the entire screen), and Gemini picks out the various constituent parts.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\"We know that sometimes you aren't just looking for a single thing on your screen—you're looking for the whole thing,\" says Google. \"Whether you're curating a mood board, building an entire outfit or just satisfying your multi-layered curiosity...Circle to Search is getting a whole lot more helpful.\"\n    \n            \n            Circle to Search can now scan for multiple items in a search.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle is also embedding the ability to virtually try on clothes from your phone in the Circle to Search flow. It's similar to the Gemini multi-step process above, with the AI taking on several sequential tasks to (in theory) be even more useful—technically, Google calls it a query fan-out technique. Again, this will be exclusive to Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 phones, with no word yet on this potentially expanding to other handsets.Finally, the last upgrade is more of a wider roll out than a new feature. The Scam Detection AI that Android uses to detect if you're being scammed in calls in real time is coming to the Galaxy S26 series for users in the U.S. It's already offered on multiple Pixel models in the U.S., the UK, Australia, Canada, India, and Ireland. The same technology is also currently available in Google Messages to catch text-based scams, and Google says it's \"enhancing\" how this works to recognize more varied scams, starting with Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 devices. The new and improved tech will use on-device models to better spot techniques used by scammers.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers more in the way of manual shooting controls, with the added benefit of an entire integrated suite of editing features.Using Snapseed's built-in camera on iPhoneOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n    \n            \n            Look out for the new camera button in Snapseed.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer. Once you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n    \n            \n            You've got some classic film styles to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.Up in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Pro controls can be called up in a couple of taps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.Most filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image. The layers button (two squares) at the top gives you access to the current editing stack, and there's also an undo button to the left. When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.It's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n    \n            \n            There's a new Create music button in Gemini.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.When you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\n    \n            \n            You can get some help with your prompting if you need it.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n    \n            \n            You also get cover art with your artificial tunes.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them. The updated Lyria 3 model is also coming to the Dream Track music maker for YouTube Shorts creators.

According to an announcement from Meta, these notifications will be available to parents in the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada who supervise their teen's accounts starting next week. As TechCrunch reports, this feature is being rolled out amid numerous lawsuits over how Meta and other tech companies have failed to protect kids and teens across their platforms. How the new safety alerts workInstagram will use teens' search activity to generate alerts. Searches that are flagged include \"phrases promoting suicide or self-harm, phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves, and terms like ‘suicide’ or ‘self-harm,'\" according to Meta. \nParents will receive alerts via email, text, or WhatsApp as well as an in-app notification. The message lets parents know that their teen has \"repeatedly searched\" for content related to suicide or self-harm and includes resources for supporting teens. Instagram already blocks searches associated with suicide and self-harm, directing users to resources instead. While users can post about their personal experiences, Meta's policies do not allow content that promotes or glorifies these topics, and Instagram hides related content from teens (even if it's from someone they follow). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnable parental supervision on InstagramTo receive alerts, parental supervision must be enabled on your teen's account. Supervision allows parents to set app time limits, enable sleep mode, and monitor and manage things like account settings, followers, accounts followed, content topics searched, and app usage. Parental supervision is available for teens ages 13–17, and teens have to agree to participate. To send a supervision invite to your teen, open the More menu in the bottom-left and click Settings. Select Supervision > Create Invite, review the information, and hit Continue. From here, you can copy the invite to send via any messaging app. Note that teens can decline supervision requests—the feature is opt-in for both parties. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        For all its faults as a platform, YouTube’s video player functionality is easily among the best online. It streams reliably to almost every device you can think of, in your choice of both video quality and playback speed. But it’s the array of hidden features and interface tricks that push it over the edge for me. (Other video players, take note.) Here are 10 of my favorite hacks that make YouTube easier to use.Search YouTube video transcripts with Ctrl-FAlmost every video on YouTube either has an official or auto-generated subtitled track. While these are mainly used for captioning, you can also pull up this transcript on the web and use Ctrl-F (or Cmd-F on Macs) to search for keywords in a video and jump straight to the part you want to see.This feature has been around for a while, but YouTube has shuffled around where to find the transcript from time to time. As of this writing, the most reliable way to find it is to open the video’s description, scroll to the bottom, and click Show transcript to open it up in a side bar.Set a sleep timer for long videosFour hour video essays and ASMR streams can be great background noise to help you fall asleep. However, if you want to avoid getting jolted awake by that one really loud joke you forgot about, you can set a sleep timer to pause any video after a certain amount of time.On web or mobile, click the Settings icon on any given video and choose Sleep timer (on mobile, it may be under Settings > More). You can choose a timer ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. You can also automatically pause once the current video is over, which is helpful if you usually have auto-play enabled.Link to specific timestamps in a videoOne of YouTube’s handiest features is the ability to deep-link to a specific second of any video, like I did in the last section. There are several ways to get a precise timestamp link. If you’re on the web, you can right click a video and choose “Copy video URL at current time.” And on mobile, when you click the Share icon, you can tap the toggle next to the timestamp to add the precise link.If none of those are options, you can even create your own timestamp link. At the end of any video URL, add “&t=01h05m47s”, replacing the numbers with the specific time you want to link to. You can use any combination of hours, minutes, and seconds to specify the point in the video you want.Use arrow keys or double-taps for quick navigationMost video players at this point have some kind of “Hang on, what did they just say?” button that lets you skip 5-10 seconds backward or forward. YouTube has several. The most straightforward, on mobile, is the double-tap. Tap twice on the left side of the screen to go backwards 10 seconds, and on the right to go forward. Keep tapping to move forward or back by further increments of 10 seconds.On the web, you have even finer grain control. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move 5 seconds back and forth. Alternatively, you can use the J-K-L keys to move in 10 second increments (with K being used to pause the video). This latter method is borrowed from video editors, making it a handy way to keep your muscle memory consistent if you do a lot of editing.Move frame-by-frame with keyboard shortcutsYouTubers love putting walls of text in a single frame of a video that you have to pause to be able to read. On mobile, the only way to read these–or examine any specific frame–is to back up and try to time your pause perfectly. On the web, however, there’s a better way. While paused on a video, you can press the , (comma) or . (period) keys to move back or forward exactly one frame at a time. You can hold these keys down to slowly move through frames as well.Quickly fast-forward with a long-pressIt’s pretty common knowledge at this point that you can play YouTube videos at 2x (or higher) speed, but what if you only want to rush through a small part of a video, like an ad read? On the mobile version of YouTube, there’s a handy gesture to do just that, without changing your default playback speed.Simply long-press and hold anywhere on the video while it’s playing. This will temporarily cause the video to play back at 2x speed, until you lift your finger. If you’re already watching at 2x or higher, it won’t play any faster (or slower) than your current speed, though.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSet your video quality defaultsYouTube generally does a pretty good job of automatically deciding what video quality to stream at, balancing fidelity with bandwidth demands. You can manually override this on a per-video basis, but on mobile, you have a few more options to get broader control.In the YouTube mobile app, head to Settings > Quality. Here, you can set separate quality defaults for video when you’re streaming over mobile networks or wifi, as well as audio quality. The latter is particularly helpful if you use YouTube for listening to music or podcasts. If your wifi is reliably fast, it can be worth it to set higher quality defaults, rather than manually change each video’s resolution whenever you notice the quality looks degraded. Use incognito mode to preserve your suggestionsYouTube can get overly eager to show you videos even vaguely similar to one you watched before. If you’d rather not get a feed full of videos on how to fix a door, you can use an incognito tab to browse without contributing to your algorithm’s history. It’s a little tougher on mobile, but fortunately the YouTube app has an option for that.In the mobile YouTube app, navigate to the You tab. Along the top of the screen, tap “Turn on incognito.” This will let you search and browse without any algorithmic recommendations or contributing to your history. You can manually turn off incognito mode, or it will automatically turn off after 90 minutes of inactivity. Note, if you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, none of your benefits will apply while you’re browsing incognito.Remove unwanted videos from your historyIf you forget to turn on incognito mode, you can still remove videos from your browsing history so they won’t muck up your recommendations. To do this, head to your YouTube history on mobile or the web, tap the three-dot menu next to the video in question, and choose “Remove from watch history.”This is usually enough to prevent a video from becoming the algorithm’s latest fixation, but it also means you won’t be able to find the video in your history again. If you want provide any kind of direct feedback, like a thumbs down or a report, make sure to do that first. Otherwise, if you navigate to the video again, it will be re-added to your history.Master even more keyboard shortcutsBeyond basic navigation, YouTube on the web has a plethora of helpful keyboard shortcuts that you might never encounter that are worth knowing about. Some of them are pretty niche, but you never know when they can come in handy:Up and Down arrows: Turn the volume on a video up or down in 5% increments.Shift+> and Shift+<:> Speed up or slow down the current video playback speedM: Mute the current video.F: Enter/exit fullscreen mode.T: Enter/exit Theater modeShift+N: Play the next video in your queue or playlist.Shift+P: Play the previous video in your queue or playlist.Ctrl/Cmd+Left or Right arrow keys: Navigate to the next or previous chapter in a video.\n            ",

To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.AI assistants are coming to CarPlay in iOS 26.4As spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.According to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant. Apple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstall the iOS 26.4 at your own riskThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes. Thankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

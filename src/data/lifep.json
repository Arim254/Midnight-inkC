This is where the GIST method can prove extremely useful.</p><p>The worst-case scenario when you're studying is that you read and read and read, but don't exactly retain much of it. That's even worse than if you don't study at all because you wasted all that time and it can be extremely demoralizing. GIST will help avoid that fate if you do it right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-gist-method\">What is the GIST method?</h2><p>The GIST method is an aptly-named system for condensing your notes (or anything you’ve read, like a chapter in a book) so everything is as simple as possible to read through and review. The point is to help you get the <em>gist</em> of the content block. Get it? </p><p>This approach requires you to resist the natural urge to pack your notes with too many details. The GIST method helps you break that habit. With it, you'll practice breaking each point down to 25 words or so. It might seem like that's just not enough to fully encapsulate everything you're learning—and it's not. It's enough to give you a solid, foundational understanding of the material that you can then build on once you get the basics down. Instead of reading thousands of words and retaining just a few of them because you have no real fundamental grasp of the ideas, you're creating a more concrete understanding of the most elemental parts.</p><p>“GIST” is an acronym for “Generating Interactions between Schemata and Texts.” It's clunky because it was obviously retrofitted to match up with the word \"GIST\" itself, a perfect example of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-use-association-to-remember-what-you-1850861942\" target=\"_blank\">using the association technique</a> to remember steps in a sequence. What this all means, in simpler terms, is creating a framework between the text you’re working from (whether that’s your full class notes or a textbook excerpt) and your condensed notes. Once you have identified the GIST of whatever you’re studying, it can serve as a roadmap to guide your review sessions, so you’re sure you’re focusing on the most critical details.</p><p>You ask yourself a few questions: What is happening? Who is doing it? When is it happening? Where is it happening? Why is it happening (or why is it important that it's happening)? How is it happening? It can be helpful to think of the familiar “Five Ws and H.” Once you have collected all of that information, write it out simply in a short-form block.</p><p>To clarify, the GIST itself isn’t what you’ll be studying. The goal is to help you identify the main message or idea of a text and hone in on it until you understand it at its most basic level. From there you can move on to the more complicated, weedy parts, too—and <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/these-are-my-favorite-mind-mapping-templates-for-studyi-1850843156\" target=\"_blank\">methods like mind mapping</a> will help you get there.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-start-using-the-gist-method-to-summarize-your-class-notes\">How to start using the GIST method to summarize your class notes</h2><p>The GIST method starts with a close reading of your notes/chapter/assigned text. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-close-reading-to-retain-every-detail-when-you-study-1850849002\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a full guide</a> on close reading.) It’s better to do this with shorter chunks of information than multiple chapters or lessons. Next, grab a sticky note or notebook paper and write, in a column, the <em>who, what, when, where, why, </em>and <em>how</em>. Answer the questions simply, taking the information straight from your notes or reading. Next, write a paragraph underneath, limiting yourself to approximately 25 words. The paragraph should summarize the answers to the questions above.</p><p>Say you're studying the Boston Tea Party. Who was involved? It was colonialists and the Sons of Liberty. What did they do? They protested against the British Tax Act. When did they do it? They did it December 16, 1773. Where did they do it? They did it in Boston Harbor. Why did they do it? They opposed taxation without representation. How did they do it? They boarded British ships and dumped tea into the harbor.</p><p>Once you have those basic answers written down, you'd write your paragraph like this: \"In December 1773, American colonists protested British taxes by dumping tea into Boston Harbor, opposing the Tea Act and taxation without representation.\" That paragraph is now the jumping-off point for everything else you have to learn. Anything else you read or go over after that will make more sense after being mapped onto this simpler distillation.</p><p>You can use a prepared GIST template to help you through the process, though <a href=\"https://www.readwritethink.org/sites/default/files/resources/lesson_images/lesson290/Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some limit your GIST to 20 words</a>. For condensing notes or studying at a higher level, 25 words is a good number to aim for, as it lets you expand complicated concepts with just a little more information—but not too much. </p>\n            </article>",

/><p>Of all the study tips out there, from those that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">enhance reading comprehension</a> to those that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">improve retention</a>, the one I use the most is association, which has <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/association\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">its own entry</a> in the APA Dictionary of Psychology: It's \"a connection or relationship between two items (e.g., ideas, events, feelings) with the result that experiencing the first item activates a representation of the second. Associations are fundamental to learning theory and behaviorism.\" Essentially, it's any connection you can form between two items—like a phrase and an idea or a color and a word—that can help you later when you think of the associated item, which will inspire the second one to pop in your brain.</p><p>It might seem silly or like a call-back to elementary school, but making up little personal memory devices helps me with everything from test-taking to completing daily work tasks. There's a reason it worked when you were in the first grade and there's no real reason you should have stopped employing it as you aged. Here are some of the easiest ways to use association when you’re trying to improve your memory.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"make-up-a-mnemonic-phrase\">Make up a mnemonic phrase</h2><p>In primary school, we all learned mnemonic phrases, like “<strong>m</strong>y <strong>v</strong>ery <strong>e</strong>ducated <strong>m</strong>other <strong>j</strong>ust <strong>s</strong>at <strong>u</strong>pon <strong>n</strong>ine <strong>p</strong>izzas.” That one was designed to help us remember the names and orders of the planets by starting each word in the sentence with the first letter of its corresponding planet: Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc. I still make up nonsensical phrases to help me remember ordered lists; I did it for a number of my classes in grad school, though the content we were studying in my MPH program was arguably a lot more elevated and serious than pizzas and planets. The particular phrase I used in my Research Methods class was a little more gauche and inappropriate, so I shan’t reveal it here, but it stuck in my brain well enough that I remember it two years after I took the final exam I made it up for. It’s not just me, either; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439266/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">loads of research</a> shows mnemonic devices <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02522/full\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">truly help retention</a>. I prefer to make up a sentence that somehow applies to my real life, but if the absurdity of mothers sitting upon pizzas works better for you, run with it.</p><h2 id=\"use-rhymes-and-songs\">Use rhymes and songs</h2><p>Making up little rhymes or songs is also beneficial, though I’ll admit I don’t do this one as often. The “30 days hath September, April, June, and November…” rhyme is a famous one, but don’t overlook the value of songs. It worked for your ABCs and your 50 Nifty United States.</p><p>Start by organizing what you need to study and look for anything that might rhyme—but make sure it all stays in order if it needs to. Use a tune you know or make up a rhyme on the spot, but repeat it to yourself over and over until it sticks.</p><p>As an example, let’s look at the <a href=\"https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">first four basic steps to take before conducting research</a>: Identifying and developing your topic, preliminarily searching for existing research, locating materials, and evaluating your sources. A rhyme here could be something like, “Identify what you want to know / but check who’s done it before you go / now you find the tools to help / and judge the work of someone else.”</p><p>If you're struggling here, you might want to ask ChatGPT. I don't usually advocate for calling in AI when you're studying, since you need to be learning the material yourself and not letting some robot do the work for you, but where I've found it to shine is in generation of things like this. There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">a handful of ethical ways</a> to study with AI and this is one of them. You won't get the benefits that go with thinking and coming up with something on your own, but if you're not creative by nature, the software can spit out a tune for you, you can rehearse it, and you can reap the benefits of that, instead. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>I just gave it the same prompt as above—a well-known tune to help me remember the first four basic steps of research—and got this, which is meant to be set to the tune of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\": </p><blockquote><p>Step one, choose a topic right,Make it clear and not too wide.Step two, search and look around,What’s already out there to be found.Step three, go and find the source,Books and journals, charts, of course.Step four, check if it makes sense —Is it strong, or just pretense?</p><p>Now you're ready, well-prepared,To research with thoughtful care.</p></blockquote><p>Whatever works!</p><h2 id=\"paint-a-mental-picture\">Paint a mental picture</h2><p>This is what I do most often: I assign little scenarios to groups of words and paint a mental picture that helps me remember them. For instance, the other night I was helping my boyfriend study accounting and discovered that “book value,” “carrying value,” and “net realizable value” all refer to the same thing. To help him remember that, I suggested imagining a little guy <em>carrying</em> a <em>book</em> and a <em>net</em>. The book could be in the net or the little guy could be carrying them both separately, but once you imagine the scene, it’s hard to forget it, even if it makes no sense or has nothing to do with the real topic at hand. Sure enough, he took his test and remembered all three words to describe the same concept with ease thanks to the fictitious little guy (and me). </p><p>When you’re studying for a test, think creatively. If something strikes you as interesting or brings to mind a silly, unrelated picture or idea, don’t dismiss it. Fortifying that mental relationship and making an association will only enhance your memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

/><p>I really don't recommend studying with other people. In my adult life, I've accumulated an Associates, Bachelors, and Masters, plus a bunch of certificates—in all those years of studying, I was frustrated with group work much more often than I was not. Sessions would devolve into chit-chat and venting sessions or someone would try to avoid pulling their weight by foisting work off on the rest of us. I became the person who would complete the entire project and let everyone put their name on it because I just wanted to avoid all that—but it was probably because I didn't know the right methods to make these sessions productive.</p><p>There are actually a few effective methods that will help you study with partners or groups, but <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-to-study-in-a-group-if-you-must-1850857034\" target=\"_blank\"><em>you have to know them before you get into that group setting</em></a>—or else run the risk of no one getting much working done. Try one of my favorite group study methods—“think, pair, share”—the next time you want to study with someone else. I wish I'd known about this one in college, but you still have a chance.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Think, pair, share is a teaching technique typically employed by instructors, but it's easily modifiable for people getting some studying done, too. According to <a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/heyteach/article/how-think-pair-share-activity-can-improve-your-classroom-discussions1704.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Western Governors University</a>, it was developed by a professor named Frank Lyman in 1981 and is helpful for shy students, as it encourages them to engage in discussion.</p><p>The name basically tells you what you need to do: </p><ul><li><p>First, you <strong>think</strong> about the subject at hand, studying it until you are pretty sure you grasp it. </p></li><li><p>Then, you <strong>pair</strong> up with someone to discuss it.</p></li><li><p>Finally, you <strong>share</strong> what you read, understand, and don’t understand with the group afterward. </p></li></ul><p>Ideally, by going over the material together, you’ll help each other fill in gaps in your understanding and enhance what you already know.</p><h2 id=\"use-tps-to-its-maximum\">Use TPS to its maximum</h2><p>Those are overly simplistic steps, so you need to have a plan for how you'll approach each one. \"Think about the subject\" is too general. On your own, you should be reading your material critically, using a reading comprehension aid like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/kwl-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a>. Those ask you to write down what you think you know, what you want to know, and what you eventually learn, which forces you to read carefully so you find the answers. When using TPS, they perform a dual function: They give you questions you can ask to the larger group, too. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>When it comes time to share, approach it with a plan, too. Volunteer to structure the study session and have everyone go around one at a time to share their favorite insight from the material or idea for the project. Split into pairs and use the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-feynman-method-to-study-1850809398\" target=\"_blank\">Feynman technique</a>, which asks you to teach a concept to another person and relies on the idea that if you can break an idea down well enough to explain it simply, you understand it well. </p><p>If you’re familiar with other group study methods, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-jigsaw-method-to-study-complex-topics-1850849174\" target=\"_blank\">jigsaw method</a> or Feynman, some of the elements of TPS might sound familiar. With jigsaw, each person in the group studies one part of the assigned text, then explains it to everyone else. When using Feynman, you explain the topic you studied as simply as you can to someone else who knows nothing about it. The difference is that with TPS, everyone in the group knows the material before discussing, so you’re not necessarily teaching anyone or being taught, so much as you’re comparing ideas.</p><p>When you’re sharing what you know, you make space for someone else to ask follow-up questions, forcing your brain to <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">use active recall</a> to search around for the answer—or sending you back to the source material to look it up. Hearing someone else’s perspective can help you reframe how you think of the topic, causing it to stick in your brain even more. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

Studies have suggested writing by hand helps you retain information better than using a computer, which is why <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">you should only bring a notebook and pen</a> with you to class in addition to (or instead of) your laptop. </p><p>But there’s more to effective note-taking than jotting down a bunch of bullet points. To be useful, your notes should be organized into topics and subtopics, with a sensible flow that you’ll be able to follow later. That’s why you should revise your notes immediately after class—even before you leave your seat, if you can. </p></div><h2 id=\"what-to-do-with-notes-after-class\">What to do with notes after class</h2><p>When you’re taking notes—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">whether typed or hand-written</a>—you have to be picky about what you do and don’t write down, given how much time it takes to do so before the lecturer moves on to another point you don’t want to miss. This is great for helping you stay engaged with the class and think critically about what is and isn’t important, but leaves the potential for gaps in your notes that you won’t realize are there until later, once you’re reading them over. So it’s best to read them over right away, and revise them as necessary.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Marty Lobdell, a former professor emeritus at Pierce College who spent 40 years teaching psychology and study skills, recommends immediate note revision and expansion in his “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Study Less, Study Smart</a>” video. While the lecture is fresh in your mind, he advises, you should use your memory of it, plus your texts and other course materials, to expand on the notes you took down.</p><p>Rewrite them completely, adding key details to what you already deemed was important in class, including anything relevant in the supplemental materials. Doing so will not only make your notes easier to study later, but will help you retain the information, since rewriting them will be your first chance to review what you’ve learned.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-maximize-your-post-class-notes\">How to maximize your post-class notes</h2><p>While taking notes in class, it’s best to be brief and concise, especially since you know you’ll be expanding them later. You can <a href=\"https://sites.austincc.edu/student-skills-workshops/taking-effective-notes/notetaking-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">use abbreviations and codes to write faster</a>, as long as you’re sure you’ll be able to decode and expand upon them later. After class, review and edit your notes, compare them to your textbook or course materials, and, if possible, another student’s notes, so you’re sure you’re not missing anything.</p><p>While writing initially and when revising, choose<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\"> the most effective note-taking method for your personal study style</a>. The outlining method works best for recopying and involves putting general information on the left side of your paper and indenting more specific groups of facts underneath. For your in-class note-taking, consider the Cornell method, which requires you to write down quick bits of information on the left side of your paper, then fill in more specifics on the right when you have time later.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Whichever method you choose, don’t leave class until your note expansion is complete (or, if that’s not realistic, take care of it as soon as possible after class). Review your notes between and 10 minutes before the next class so everything is fresh in your mind before you move on.</p><h2 id=\"ideas-for-better-notes-and-revision\">Ideas for better notes and revision</h2><p>Taking notes using an established method, like Cornell, is your best bet, since it gives you a little structure while you go. The way you revise them is important, too. I recommend reformatting them <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">into a mind map</a>. This is a visual representation of how concepts work together. Reminiscent of a flowchart, it uses bubbles, colors, and arrows to denote related topics and subtopics. Here, you can call on tech for backup. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">I like the Xmind app</a> for creating simple, fast mind maps. </p><p>The benefits of revising this way are numerous. First, you force yourself not just to focus on topics and concepts, but on how they all fit together, which helps entrench them in your mind and enhance your understanding overall. Second, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">adding in some color</a> or intrigue helps with retention, too. Third, forcing yourself to reformat the notes in a completely different way than you took them makes you think differently about them and focus on getting everything right.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

I've been on the app for something like 15 years now, and during this time, I've learned a trick or two that improve the experience (or at least make it less annoying). Here are 10 Instagram hacks that will enhance your privacy, reduce the amount of junk in your feed, help you reset your algorithm, and more.On every social media app, I like to set up filters to mute offensive keywords, but you can use keywords to block almost anything you don't want to see. On Instagram, you can use filters to easily block spammy comments and offensive messages. While you can customize your filter list, I just looked up a list of offensive phrases, and quickly added it to my IG account, then added a few additional terms.You can do the same thing by going to your Instagram profile page, and tapping the three-lines menu in the top-right corner in Instagram. This opens the Settings and activity page, where you can select Hidden Words. It lets you add multiple words, as long as you separate them with a comma. Once added, Instagram will block comments and messages containing those terms.You can also add mute keywords for posts appearing in your feed. Go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Specific words and phrases. On the Content preferences page, go to Sensitive content and Political content, and you can limit those types of posts and videos from showing up on your feed too.Reset your Instagram algorithmEvery once in a while, my Instagram algorithm goes haywire and I'm forced to reset it. After all, I mostly open this app to see my friends' updates and cat videos, and once my feed starts showing me too much Hyrox content (a \"sport\" I couldn't care less about), I know I'm in trouble. If something like this happens to you, there are two ways to reprogram your feed. The easy option is to just look for a reel you enjoy (such as a cat video), and swipe upwards a few times till you reach a non-cat video, then navigate away. Repeat this process a few times and your feed will be back to more cat videos and less Hyrox (or anything else).If that doesn't work, or if your feed is too far gone in the wrong direction, then you can go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Reset suggested content to reboot it entirely.Remove tracking links from InstagramWhen you share any post, reel, story, or other type of content on Instagram, the app tracks who you're sharing it with, even if you send the link outside Instagram. You can see this by tapping the Share button on any post, and selecting Copy link: Paste this link in any text editor, such as Apple Notes or Google Keep, and you'll see that the link has tracking parameters at the end, such as \"?igsh=…\" or \"?utm…\". That helps Instagram identify that you've shared the link.There's no way to disable this tracking, but you can manually remove it from each link before you send it to someone. Just paste the URL it as usual, then delete everything after the question mark.Force Instagram to open DM links in your preferred browser\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWhenever you open a link in Instagram, the app opens it in an in-app browser. This is the least privacy friendly option, as Instagram can then track which websites you're visiting quite easily. You can partially stop this by tapping the three-dots button in the top-right corner of Instagram's in-app browser and selecting Open in external browser.There's no way to make this the default setting for all links, but you can set it as default for links you receive via DM. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > App website permissions > Message links and turn on Open in external browser.Limit your Instagram notificationsAfter you post something, Instagram loves to spam you with notifications every time a few people interact with the post. Even if you don't use Instagram for a day or two, you'll still get a deluge of notifications from the app. I don't face this problem because I never allow Instagram permission to send any notifications on my devices, but that's not an option for everyone. If you don't want to turn off notifications entire, you can choose to receive only the useful notifications from Instagram. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > Notifications and review all the options available to you. I particularly like the Messages only option, which only sends me an alert when someone DMs viaon the app.To further limit notifications, go to the Following and followers section on this page, and disable Account suggestions. Similarly, you can go to Messages and disable Message reminders and all varieties of channel notification settings. You can also go to the Calls section and turn off Video chats, which has the added bonus of disabling video calls on Instagram, which I've never wanted to use.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHide your online status and disable read receipts on InstagramFor some reason, Instagram shows other people when you're online. If you want to be more discreet, go to Instagram Settings > Messages and story replies > Show activity status and turn the setting off. (On the previous page, you can select Show read receipts and turn it off to stop people seeing if you've read their messages too.)Hide the \"typing\" indicator in Instagram messagesWhen someone is messaging you on Instagram, the app shows you an animation to tell you that the other person is typing. More often than not, this feature only makes me keep the app open longer while the other person types their message, which is probably why Instagram's added it in the first place. If you don't want to see the typing indicator in a chat, you can disable it: Open any chat in Instagram and tap the contact's name up top. Go to Privacy and safety and turn off Typing indicator. Sadly, you'll need to do this manually for each of your Instagram chats.Enable end-to-end encryption to make Instagram more secure\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nInstagram chats are not encrypted by default, which means that the company can read all your messages. If you want to beef up your security, consider using end-to-end encryption for your chats. Just like Telegram, Instagram hides its end-to-end encrypted chat feature, and makes you enable it manually for each chat. You can do so by opening any chat in Instagram, tapping the contact's name up top, selecting Privacy and safety > Use end-to-end encryption.Automatically clear your Instagram search historyYour Instagram search history shows up whenever you try to search for anything on Instagram. This can be embarrassing if you've looked up something really silly (or slightly naughty), and someone else sees it. to prevent this, you can clear your searches by tapping the search bar in Instagram, and selecting Clear all, or tapping the x next to each search term. However, there's also a way to automatically clear your search history on Instagram: Go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Your information and permissions > Search history > Keep searches for, and select 3 days, which is the minimum time for automatically deleting your searches.There's no way to block ads on Instagram, but you can reduce the amount of your data that Instagram uses to show you those ads. Just go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Ad preferences > Manage info. You can go through each option on this page and turn off everything you can. Under Categories used to reach you, select Remove on every option.You can choose Don't allow us… in these two categories: Ads in other apps and Ads about Meta. Finally, you can select Activity information from ad partners > Review setting, and pick No, don't make my ads more relevant.\n            \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Pranay Parab\n                                Pranay Parab is an independent tech journalist based in Mumbai, India.

According to an announcement from Meta, these notifications will be available to parents in the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada who supervise their teen's accounts starting next week. As TechCrunch reports, this feature is being rolled out amid numerous lawsuits over how Meta and other tech companies have failed to protect kids and teens across their platforms. How the new safety alerts workInstagram will use teens' search activity to generate alerts. Searches that are flagged include \"phrases promoting suicide or self-harm, phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves, and terms like ‘suicide’ or ‘self-harm,'\" according to Meta. \nParents will receive alerts via email, text, or WhatsApp as well as an in-app notification. The message lets parents know that their teen has \"repeatedly searched\" for content related to suicide or self-harm and includes resources for supporting teens. Instagram already blocks searches associated with suicide and self-harm, directing users to resources instead. While users can post about their personal experiences, Meta's policies do not allow content that promotes or glorifies these topics, and Instagram hides related content from teens (even if it's from someone they follow). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnable parental supervision on InstagramTo receive alerts, parental supervision must be enabled on your teen's account. Supervision allows parents to set app time limits, enable sleep mode, and monitor and manage things like account settings, followers, accounts followed, content topics searched, and app usage. Parental supervision is available for teens ages 13–17, and teens have to agree to participate. To send a supervision invite to your teen, open the More menu in the bottom-left and click Settings. Select Supervision > Create Invite, review the information, and hit Continue. From here, you can copy the invite to send via any messaging app. Note that teens can decline supervision requests—the feature is opt-in for both parties. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Fraudsters are impersonating representatives from mobile carriers, calling customers and claiming that they've been sent the wrong device and need to return it. Obviously, if you follow through, scammers get to keep your phone—they may either to sell it or activate it using your information to perpetrate identity fraud. Scams centered on stealing high-value tech aren't anything new. In addition to regular porch pirating, thieves have been known to knock on doors, posing as couriers or company representatives attempting to recover a \"wrongly delivered\" item. Fraudsters have also used fake Find My alerts to gain access to lost or stolen iPhones. \nHow the phone return scam worksAs an editor at ZDNET experienced, the scam begins shortly after your new phone is delivered. You may receive a call from a spoofed number, and someone claiming to represent your carrier will have specific information like your name, address, and device model. They'll tell you that there's been a mix-up and you need to send your phone back so you can receive a replacement. They may give you instructions to scan a QR code, print a label, and take the package to a shipping drop-off point. In some cases, targets have been promised gift cards for the inconvenience. If you hesitate, scammers may employ a number of pressure tactics to get you to act. They'll tell you that delaying the return could cause issues with your device activation, billing, or warranty. They may continue to call with threats. Like many scams, this one relies on social engineering: it manipulates emotions and instincts to get you to act against your best interest. Fraudsters impersonate a trusted brand and use detailed information about you to make their story more believable. They use timing to their advantage and promote a sense of urgency. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe phone return scam also has similarities to the brushing scam, in which victims receive a package containing merchandise they didn't order so that scammers can write a verified review or boost sales numbers or collect personally identifiable information once you scan a QR code (an added component known as quishing) to learn more about the item. What to do if you get a call about your new phoneThe solution here is to simply hang up. If you are concerned about your account or device, call your carrier directly (use the customer service number from a previous bill or go through the official app) and confirm the mix-up. Don't engage with QR codes or any instructions provided on unsolicited calls. It may be alarming that a scammer has specific details about your order and calls right after your new phone is delivered. Unfortunately, a lot of your personal information is out in the open and available to bad actors, whether as the result of a data breach or some other form of compromise (such as malware that can read notifications). This is a good reason to keep an eye out for other indicators of identity theft and act quickly if you find anything suspicious. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers have a lot to gain by targeting travelers: The Federal Trade Commission tracked more than 58,000 reports of travel, vacation, and timeshare plan fraud in 2024 totaling $274 million in losses. And AI is helping them get away with it. How scammers are targeting travelersSome of the most common travel scams involve impersonation: of people, brands, and listings. For example, fraudsters will post fake vacation rental listings and collect payment (sometimes by pressuring you to use wire transfers or peer-to-peer apps) and leave you stranded with no place to stay or stuck in accommodations way worse than what you booked and paid for. On the back end of a trip, a dishonest host may try to make fraudulent damage claims and pressure you into paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for something you didn't do. Scammers will also impersonate travel agents and booking platforms, allowing them to collect sensitive personal information and money before you clock the fraud. Booking.com is a common target for scams. Multiple campaigns have used a spoofed version of the site to spread malware—another known as \"I Paid Twice\" targeted both Booking.com and Expedia. \nOther travel scams involve fake flight cancellation notifications (which direct you to rebook on a phishing website), fake customer service numbers promoted via both sponsored ads and legitimate business listings, and deals that are too good to be true. AI facilitates travel scams These days, even savvy consumers can fall victim to these travel scams. As travel expert and consumer advocate Christopher Elliott writes for The Seattle Times, AI has rendered traditional scam red flags practically obsolete. We can no longer rely on obvious grammar and spelling errors to differentiate between what's real and what isn't, as tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are capable of nearly flawless replication of human speech and generating authentic-looking content—like photos, rental listings, and entire websites—in almost no time.According to McAfee, one of the most common ways AI has changed the travel scam landscape is via voice cloning. Threat actors can make deepfake calls using just a few seconds of voice samples pulled from promotional material or customer service recordings. You may not be able to differentiate between a fake airline representative, hotel staff, or travel agent and a real one, and fraudsters use this to get everything from passport information to credit card numbers. AI also makes phishing attempts far harder to spot, as scammers can craft booking confirmations and other communication using authentic branding and perfect text. And fake booking sites (as described above), rental listings, and tour pages are nearly indistinguishable from real ones, thanks to AI-generated photos, videos, and reviews. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to identify AI-powered travel scamsThankfully, AI hasn't eliminated every scam indicator. Urgency should always raise alarms, as scammers count on targets responding to demands before having time to think. If you're being pressured to provide information or pay money or book before a deal expires, it might be a scam. Slow down and verify before taking action. If you're asked to send money via crypto, wire transfers, gift cards, or apps like Venmo and Zelle, it's almost certainly a scam. Always book travel over trusted platforms using credit cards, which have fraud protection and can be tracked or disputed. If a customer service rep contacts you about your trip, ask them to verify your booking details before providing any additional information. If they cannot confirm things like your reservation number or card on file, they are likely not legitimate. If you're unsure, hang up and call the hotel, airline, or travel agent using contact information obtained from an official source. Finally, check travel websites carefully for subtle signs of a scam. Be wary of URL tricks like homograph attacks and typosquatting, which are used to spread malware. Legitimate businesses will also have contact information and privacy policies on their websites. Avoid getting to websites through search results and unsolicited emails and social media messages—instead, go directly through trusted communication or type the correct URL into the address bar. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive. This is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it. How Android will back up your files after the updateAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to check your Android backup settingsWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes. Thankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.How the Google Forms job scam worksThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job. As Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials. \nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page. How to avoid phishing attempts on your Google credentialsAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms. This is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The data breach itself isn't new—it was initially disclosed in January 2025, and Conduent has already notified millions of individuals whose data was compromised in the incident. However, the breach is now believed to be larger in scale than previously reported, possibly among the largest to affect healthcare. Who is Conduent? Conduent is a New Jersey-based business processing outsourcing (BPO) company that provides services like printing, payment, and document and claims processing to state and federal government agencies as well as large commercial and transportation organizations. According to the company's 2025 annual report, these offerings include disbursement of benefits, such as food assistance and child support, and administration of government healthcare programs (like Medicaid). For large corporations, services include workplace and unemployment benefits management. Conduent was spun off from Xerox in 2017 and now employs around 51,000 people worldwide. \nWhat happened with the Conduent breach?In January 2025, Conduent suffered an outage that was later confirmed to be the result of a \"cybersecurity incident.\" The disruption lasted several days, during which agencies across the U.S. were unable to process some benefit payments. While the breach was discovered in January, hackers reportedly gained access to Conduent's systems months earlier on October 21, 2024. The Safepay ransomware gang later took credit for the attack. While Conduent confirmed in April 2025 that client information had been stolen in the breach, it didn't begin notifying affected individuals until October. According to those notices, the compromised data included names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance policy information, and medical information. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow many people were impacted by the breach? The scope of the breach continues to grow, but the total number of individuals affected currently sits around 25 million. The greatest impact appears to be in Texas and Oregon, though residents in California, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico have also received notices. (For reference, the total number of users impacted by the 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare is now estimated at 190 million.) What to do if you were affectedIf you receive a notice saying your information was compromised, you should take every precaution to secure your identity: At a minimum, ensure your credit is frozen, and set up a one-year fraud alert on your credit files to prevent someone from applying for credit using your information. None of the notices we've seen have offered any type of credit monitoring or identity theft protection services to affected individuals, but you could utilize these services as well. At this point—given the ubiquity of data breaches and information compromise—you should be keeping a close eye on your credit report and financial accounts at all times to quickly catch anything suspicious. If you do find fraudulent activity, report it to your bank and/or credit issuer immediately, and file an identity theft report. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices. What's new with Samsung's February security updateSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.     Not all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear. \nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to install Samsung's February security updateOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now.

As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.WhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.Speaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: WhatsApp\n                    \n    \nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.Still, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.WhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.If you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n    \n            \n            You can mute some or all of your phone's notifications when driving.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.On both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.Other Android Auto notification settingsAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.When you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.There are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n    \n            \n            You can control how messages appear on your dashboard.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.It's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.You should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.As part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears. While I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.    \nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther new features in this Release Preview Channel updateThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.  You can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.   \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Right now, the 2024 Motorola Razr+ (unlocked, 12GB RAM, 256GB storage) is discounted to $417.09 on Woot for the next five days or until inventory lasts. Amazon lists it at $549.95, and price trackers show its previous low was $499.99, so it’s a sizable drop for a current-generation foldable. That said, this is an open-box unit, meaning it may have been a photo sample or simply had damaged packaging, but it functions like new. Prime members get free standard shipping, while others pay $6. The phone ships unlocked and includes a one-year Motorola limited warranty.\nThe aluminum frame of the Razr+ 2024 has rounded edges that feel better in hand, and its vegan leather back adds grip and resists fingerprints. Folded, it takes up less space than most slab phones and fits easily into smaller pockets. The hinge feels firm and stable when opening and closing, and the phone carries an IPX8 rating, so it can survive submersion in water rather than just splashes. The crease is visible when the screen is off and can catch light at certain angles, but it reportedly fades during normal use. The main camera performs well in daylight with detailed shots and balanced color, though low-light images fall short of what you get from top-tier Samsung or Google phones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe four-inch outer OLED display is large enough to run full apps. You can reply to messages, check directions, or scroll social feeds without flipping it open. Inside, the 6.9-inch OLED panel is sharp and responsive, with a high refresh rate that keeps animations smooth. Performance is powered by a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor with 12GB of RAM. In daily use, apps open quickly, and multitasking feels fluid. The 256GB of storage gives most users plenty of room, but with no microSD slot, storage is fixed and cannot be expanded. Battery life is around 14.5 hours, edging out some competing flip phones, including Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 5, notes this PCMag review.

That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers more in the way of manual shooting controls, with the added benefit of an entire integrated suite of editing features.Using Snapseed's built-in camera on iPhoneOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n    \n            \n            Look out for the new camera button in Snapseed.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer. \nOnce you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n    \n            \n            You've got some classic film styles to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.Up in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Pro controls can be called up in a couple of taps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.Most filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image. The layers button (two squares) at the top gives you access to the current editing stack, and there's also an undo button to the left. When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.It's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That might be a gift registry for a baby shower, or letting your friends and family know what you want for your birthday. But it's also commonly used for online creators to receive gifts from fans or for someone in need to receive donated items from strangers online who want to help. Up until now, we could rely on Wish List as a secure way for strangers to send items, without worrying about setting up a post office box. But going forward, Wish List now runs the risk of telling fans exactly where the creator lives—unless the creator takes action.Amazon is putting addresses at risk with changes to Wish List As reported by 404 Media, Amazon is recommending customers that use Wish Lists to change their shipping addresses to either P.O. boxes or non-residential delivery addresses. The company is making changes to Wish Lists, which could reveal the address you have on file for the feature. By leaving it as your home address, you are putting yourself at risk of doxxing—or revealing your personal address to strangers on the internet. That's because Amazon is now removing the option to block purchases from third-party sellers for Wish List items. As such, anyone who buys items off your Wish List to send to you will be able to buy them from third-party sellers, and those sellers will have access to your delivery address. From Amazon's point of view, these changes give buyers more flexibility over the items they can buy from your list, but that unfortunately comes with an impact on your personal privacy. But it's not just sellers who will have access to this address: Buyers will, too, as they may see your address in shipping updates they receive throughout the buying process.\nAs 404 Media highlights, major shippers don't usually reveal addresses in these situations. But Amazon's changes mean that third-party sellers have it in their power to share this information themselves. What's more, if the delivery person ends up taking photos of the package to confirm delivery, that could leak even more of your personal details than you'd want—such as what your front door or driveway look like.   These changes aren't effective immediately, so if you use Amazon's Wish Lists, you don't have to worry about your home address leaking on the internet just yet. However, the company has set a deadline for March 25, so it's important to act fast if you want to protect yourself. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBelow, you can read the email Amazon is sending the following email to Wish List users:“We're writing to inform you about an upcoming change to Amazon Lists. Starting March 25, 2026, we will remove the option to restrict purchases from third-party sellers for list items. When this change takes effect, gift purchasers will be able to purchase items sold by third-party sellers from your lists and your delivery address will be shared with the seller for fulfillment. This change will provide gift purchasers with access to a wider selection of items when shopping from your lists...Important note: When gifts are purchased from your shared or public lists, Amazon needs to provide your shipping address to sellers and delivery partners to fulfill these orders. During the delivery process, your address may become visible to gift purchasers through delivery updates and tracking information. To help protect your privacy, we recommend using a PO Box or non-residential address for any list you share with public audiences.” How to prevent buyers from seeing your address from your Amazon Wish ListIf you have an online presence and want to protect your address, you'll need to update your address in Wish List settings. Head to this link, then choose \"manage list.\" Here, you can adjust your Wish List settings to make it private, or to choose specific users to share it with. Otherwise, you can adjust your address if you have a P.O. box or alternative address to select. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

In fact, one of these new features seems like a significant step forward for AI on smartphones: the ability for Gemini to handle multi-step tasks on an Android phone. The examples Google gives are booking a ride through Uber or reordering a meal on DoorDash, where the AI takes care of everything in the background, leaving you free to worry about, well, whether it's going to work.Google wants Gemini to perform tasks on your behalf  \"When you're working on a repetitive daily task, it's easy to daydream about handing it off to someone else,\" explains Google in the announcement blog post. \"Now, we're showing an early preview of what's possible.\" Understandably, this has a \"beta\" label as well as an \"early preview\" label attached, and it's initially only going to be available on Galaxy S26 phones and Pixel 10 phones (the Pixel 10a misses out). It'll also be limited to the U.S. and South Korea to begin with.As per Google, the process will be tightly controlled: Automations begin with your voice command and end as soon as the task is finished. Live notifications will keep you updated throughout, and you can jump in and take manual control at any time. What's more, the app is run in a \"secure, virtual window\" on your phone, with restricted app access.\nIt's going to be interesting to see how well this works. If it works well, this feels like a notable moment in getting AI to actually do mobile tasks for us. It's not clear if Google needs third-party app permission for this, but for now the feature will be available \"for select apps\" in the food, grocery, and rideshare categories.Google is upgrading Circle to Search and Scam DetectionNext, Google is upgrading Circle to Search on Android, the feature that lets you circle anything on screen and run a search from it. Circle to Search can do everything from find you a lamp online to warn you about a phishing scam.Now, Circle to Search will be able to search multiple elements on screen at once. It might be different pieces of furniture in a room, or different items of clothing in an outfit. You don't actually make the selections yourself: You just circle the relevant area (or the entire screen), and Gemini picks out the various constituent parts.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\"We know that sometimes you aren't just looking for a single thing on your screen—you're looking for the whole thing,\" says Google. \"Whether you're curating a mood board, building an entire outfit or just satisfying your multi-layered curiosity...Circle to Search is getting a whole lot more helpful.\"\n    \n            \n            Circle to Search can now scan for multiple items in a search.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle is also embedding the ability to virtually try on clothes from your phone in the Circle to Search flow. It's similar to the Gemini multi-step process above, with the AI taking on several sequential tasks to (in theory) be even more useful—technically, Google calls it a query fan-out technique. Again, this will be exclusive to Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 phones, with no word yet on this potentially expanding to other handsets.Finally, the last upgrade is more of a wider roll out than a new feature. The Scam Detection AI that Android uses to detect if you're being scammed in calls in real time is coming to the Galaxy S26 series for users in the U.S. It's already offered on multiple Pixel models in the U.S., the UK, Australia, Canada, India, and Ireland. The same technology is also currently available in Google Messages to catch text-based scams, and Google says it's \"enhancing\" how this works to recognize more varied scams, starting with Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 devices. The new and improved tech will use on-device models to better spot techniques used by scammers.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

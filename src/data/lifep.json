videos are getting</a>. What's even scarier, however, is how accessible the tools to create these videos are. Using something like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-we-know-about-openais-tiktok-for-ai\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI's Sora app</a>, people can create hyper-realistic short-form videos of just about anything they want—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-stop-deepfakes-on-sora\" target=\"_blank\">including real people</a>, like celebrities, friends, or even themselves. </p><p>OpenAI knows the risks involved with an app that makes generating realistic videos this easy. As such, the company places a watermark on any Sora generation you create via the app. That way, when you're scrolling throughout your social media feeds, if you see a little Sora logo with a cute cloud with eyes bouncing around, you know it's AI-generated.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"you-cant-trust-a-sora-watermark\">You can't trust a Sora watermark</h2><p>My immediate worry when OpenAI announced this app was that people would find a way to remove the watermark, sowing confusion across the internet. I wasn't wrong: <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/sora-2-watermark-removers-flood-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">There are already plenty of options out there</a> for interested parties who want to make their AI slop even more realistic. But what I didn't expect was the opposite: people who want to <em>add </em>the Sora watermark to real videos, to make them look as if they were created with AI. </p><p>I was recently scrolling—or, perhaps, doomscrolling—on X when I started seeing some of these videos, like <a href=\"https://x.com/riomadeit/status/1976106455813029942\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">this one featuring Apple executive Craig Federighi</a>: The post says \"sora is getting so good,\" and includes the Sora watermark, so I assumed someone made a cameo of Federighi in the app and posted it on X. To my surprise, however, the video is simply pulled from one of Apple's pre-recorded WWDC events—one where Federighi parkours around Apple HQ.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"https://x.com/theo/status/1976026324008566816\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">I saw this clip</a>, which also uses a Sora watermark. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking it's an OpenAI product. But look closer, and you can tell the clip uses real people: The shots are too perfect, without the fuzziness or glitching that you tend to see from AI video generation. This clip is simply spoofing the way Sora tends to generate multi-shot clips of people talking. (Astute viewers may also notice the watermark is a little larger and more static than the real Sora watermark.)</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theo/status/1976026324008566816\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As it turns out, the account that posted that second clip <a href=\"https://x.com/theo/status/1976096703603458370\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">also made a tool</a> for adding a Sora watermark to any video. They don't explain the thinking or purpose behind the tool, but it's definitely real. And even if this tool didn't exist, I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to edit a Sora watermark into a video, especially if you weren't concerned about replicating the movement of Sora's official watermark. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>To be clear, people were already posting like this before adding the watermark tool. The joke is to say you made something with Sora, but post a popular or infamous clip instead—say, <a href=\"https://x.com/tervisscoot/status/1976018927357657178\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Drake's Sprite ad from 15 years ago</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/Andr3jH/status/1973171921899626966\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Taylor Swift dancing at The Eras Tour</a>, or <a href=\"https://x.com/DeREALBeug/status/1974883225282793721\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">an entire <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movie</a>. It's a funny meme, especially when it's obvious that the video <em>wasn't</em> made by Sora. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tervisscoot/status/1976018927357657178\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"real-or-not-real\">Real or not real?</h2><p>But this is an important reminder to be constantly vigilant when scrolling through videos on your feeds. You have to be on the lookout for both clips that aren't real, as well as clips that are actually real, but are being advertised as AI-generated. There are a lot of implications here. Sure, it's funny to slap a Sora watermark on a viral video, but what happens when someone adds the watermark to a real video of illegal activity? \"Oh, that video isn't real. Any videos you see of it without the watermark were tampered with.\"</p><p>At the moment, it doesn't seem like anyone has figured out how to perfectly replicate the Sora watermark, so there will be signs if someone actually tries to pass a real video off as AI. But this is still all a bit concerning, and I don't know what the solution could be. Maybe we're heading towards a future in which internet videos are simply treated as untrustworthy across the board. If you can't determine what's real or fake, why bother trying?</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

A great example of this: the Von Restorff effect, which refers to our brains’ acuity for remembering distinctive pieces of information over more uniform ones, a fact discovered by a German psychiatrist named Hedwig von Restorff. It’s an interesting fact of biology, but it can also be very useful to know when you’re studying a difficult concept. Here’s why, and how to put the Von Restorff effect to good use.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-von-restorff-effect\">What is the Von Restorff effect?</h2><p>In previous articles, I’ve discussed various memory effects you can capitalize on when you study, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-primacy-effect-can-help-you-remember-informat-1850432109\" target=\"_blank\">primacy effect</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-proust-effect-can-help-you-study-1850749025\" target=\"_blank\">Proust effect</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-production-effect-to-study-more-effectively-1850915123\" target=\"_blank\">production effect</a>. All of these begin with a nice, a round-looking “P\" and the consonant blend of \"Pr-.\" If I add the Von Restorff effect to that list, it will stand out solely because of the variety in its name—the rigid angle of that “V\" and the hard sound of the Restorff. Because of this, you’re more likely to remember the Von Restorff effect when asked to name the four memory phenomena we just went over—and <em>that’s </em>the Von Restorff effect in action.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the simplest terms, it is an “isolation effect” that ensures your brain will remember an item in a list if it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other entries on the list. When studying, you can achieve this effect by changing the meaningfulness of an item or a piece of information in some way, whether by color, size, font choice, or another approach.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-von-restorff-effect-to-remember-what-you-study\">How to use the Von Restorff effect to remember what you study</h2><p>The good news is that, unlike when you try to harness the power of other memory-based study techniques, this one is pretty straightforward. It's almost too simple, which is why you might not be familiar with it or ever have considered finding ways to use it. Once you realize the simplicity of this concept, it’s easy to find ways to work it into your study habits. </p><ul><li><p>In your notes, use a highlighter specifically to highlight words or concepts you need to remember for a test. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">Color-coding your notes</a> is a supremely helpful studying technique on its own because even taking the time to choose the colors and their meanings helps you focus. </p></li><li><p>When using flashcards, write concepts and words you’re having a hard time grasping in a different color. If you're using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner method</a> (which you should be), you can rewrite or recreate cards every time you drill them. With that technique, you move your cards into piles every time you get them right or wrong, then study the piles at different frequencies, focusing on ones you know less often than ones that are giving you trouble. Every few times you move a card up or down into a pile, try rewriting or recreating it with a different text color. If a card is red but your color for easy ones is blue, you'll be instantly reminded that this is one you recently struggled with, which can help you lock in and pull the information from your memory using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">active recall</a>. </p></li><li><p>When studying with others and talking through the material (or reading aloud from your notes), try associating a unique motion—like a specific hand gesture—with the concepts you’re discussing. </p></li><li><p>Use a shape, like a circle or box, to outline key parts of your notes or textbook materials. Do this when you're mind-mapping, especially, so all your mind maps are uniform. Dates can be in squares, vocab words in circles, and so on. To make quick and efficient mind maps, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">an app like Xmind</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">mind-mapping</a>, move the circle containing the most important concepts (or the one you’re struggling to grasp) to a more removed part of your page, differentiating it from the rest of the clusters visually. I do a version of this with my to-do list, which is written on a whiteboard on the fridge. Unusual things, like a doctor's visit or something I need to buy but don't usually get on my weekly trip to the grocery store, get written off to the side. They're more notable that way, drawing my attention away from the larger block of text and reminding me, over and over, that I have to do them. By the time doctor's appointment day rolls around or I'm in the store trying to remember my list, those are seared into my brain. </p></li><li><p>If you're revising your notes, use different text styles. This is something I did all the time in college, even when taking notes in class. I would bold anything a professor led into by announcing, \"This will be on the test.\" I would turn vocab words purple. Even if you're hand-writing (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">which you should be!</a>), you can draw squiggly underlines under certain ideas, circle others ... you get the point. Get zany with it, but keep it uniform. If you draw a big box around one date, do it to all of them. If you draw arrows pointing to a state law and a circle around a federal one, do it to all of them. </p></li></ul><p>The goal is to differentiate the things you need or struggle to remember using color, motion, shape, or even orientation. Setting certain ideas or words apart will make them stick in your brain better, no matter how you do it. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

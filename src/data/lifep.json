    "body": "\n        \n        Strava has voluntarily dropped its (frankly baffling) lawsuit against fellow fitness giant Garmin. Strava's filing today is incredibly brief—just a single line, with no filings or responses from Garmin since the case began 21 days ago. The original lawsuit demanded that Garmin cease selling all of its fitness watches and cycling computers, claiming patent infringement on two core features—segments and heatmaps—and alleges that Garmin violated a decade-old cooperation agreement between the two companies. Here's the thing: Garmin almost never loses patent battles. And today's news continues that trend. Considering that Garmin is Strava’s most important partner, where does leave the two companies now?What was Strava's lawsuit even about?According to Strava's Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar, the lawsuit was meant to take action against Garmin's plan to cut off API access unless Strava plasters the Garmin logo across virtually every part of its platform. What that looked like practically was Strava targeting two main patent claims. \nThe first involves heatmaps and popularity routing, covered by patents filed in December 2014 and issued in 2016. These patents describe technology for generating maps that show where users work out based on aggregated GPS data from multiple users. This first claim is pretty clear-cut, but before diving into that, know that the second patent focuses on a different signature feature: segments. This patent, filed in March 2011 and granted in August 2015, covers the concept of user-defined route segments where athletes can compete for best times using GPS data.For more context, the timing of this suit comes on the heels of recent friction between the companies. In 2024, Strava implemented controversial API changes that disrupted many third-party fitness apps. Around the same time, Garmin began requiring API partners to provide attribution for data sourced from Garmin Connect—a policy Strava reportedly resisted.Additionally, Garmin launched its Trails+ feature in May 2025 as part of a paid Garmin Connect+ subscription, which Strava may view as encroachment on its subscription-based revenue model. According to DC Rainmaker's sources, Strava formally notified Garmin of the patent concerns in late June 2025, with a follow-up in July. Why was the lawsuit so short-lived?Backing up a little, it's worth noting here that Strava and Garmin's relationship has been close for over a decade. As trusted fitness tech blogger DC Rainmaker explains, Garmin introduced its own segments feature back in June 2014, before partnering with Strava to implement \"Strava Live Segments\" on Garmin devices in July 2015 through a Master Cooperation Agreement. Strava now claims that Garmin expanded beyond the scope of that agreement by continuing to develop and deploy its own Garmin-branded segments alongside Strava's features. Notably, this alleged infringement has been ongoing for approximately 10 years.This was an uphill battle for Strava from the jump. Perhaps most damaging to Strava's case was the timeline issue, particularly regarding heatmaps. According to DC Rainmaker's research, Garmin actually introduced heatmaps in Garmin Connect in early 2013—more than a year and a half before Strava filed its patent application in December 2014. Multiple other platforms, including third-party developers using Strava's own API data, had also created heatmap functionality during this period.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\"The fact that they got a patent for it is a testament to how messy software patents have been over the years,\" DC Rainmaker observes. Garmin's lawyers could easily argue this patent shouldn't have been granted  in the first place, similar to when Wahoo sued Zwift and quickly dropped the suit after a judge questioned the validity of their patents.Today there's a good bit speculation about what exactly went down behind the scenes. What we can see is that Strava made a gross miscalculation about how much Garmin would fold; Strava's legal arguments were shaky at best, and in targeting Garmin, the company decided to target its single biggest and closest partner—one with a formidably victorious track record. It was high-risk, and most likely not at all worth it. What happens now?In the last two weeks, we’ve already seen Garmin announce new integrations with Komoot (a Strava competitor). Time will tell if Strava just botched its most important relationship, and what that could mean for users. For now, users of both platforms can continue using their devices and syncing data as usual. But the lawsuit debacle highlights growing tensions in the fitness tech ecosystem, as companies increasingly compete not just for users, but control over all the data and features that athletes have come to rely on.\n            ",

Such is the case with a recent spate of unprompted texts purporting to be from the crypto wallet service Coinbase. If you receive such a message, even if you have a Coinbase account, delete it. Someone is likely trying to scam you. Coinbase isn't texting you Here's how the scam works: You receive an unsolicited text message that reads \"Your Coinbase withdrawal code is...\" followed by a six-digit number. The message continues: \"Please do not share this code with anyone. If you have no requested this, please call:\" followed by a phone number and a reference number. On the surface, this seems like a fairly standard two-factor authentication (2FA) code. Most companies include a similar warning in their messages when sending along your code, as hackers really want you to give them those digits. In many cases, a 2FA code the only thing standing between them and your account, so companies want to ensure you don't hand yours over to someone else.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nUnfortunately, this text is an example of the opposite: a scammer impersonating the language of a legitimate company in order to gain your trust. The hope on the scammer's part is that you receive this text and assume that it's real, but worry, because you know you didn't request a 2FA code. Since you now trust that the message really is from Coinbase, you might turn to the contact number conveniently included with the message to follow up. Hey, they've even attached a reference number, so the \"Coinbase rep\" you talk to can track your issue. How considerate. In reality, this is one big scam. If you called the number, the scammer will likely continue the charade, perhaps by assuring you that they'll help secure your account. My guess is that the scammer would ask you to \"verify\" your Coinbase login credentials, which they would enter on their end, triggering the legitimate 2FA process. Once you receive that code, the scammer might ask you to tell them what it is as part of verification process. But once they have that code, they can log into your account for real, change the password, and lock you out. Bye bye crypto. If you're a Coinbase user, this definitely seems concerning, but don't worry too much: I've been getting these scam texts myself, and I don't have a Coinbase account. While scammers might be targeting Coinbase users who have had their information leaked in data breaches, it's more likely they're simply sending these scam texts to leaked phone numbers en masse. They'll likely snag some anxious Coinbase users in their net, but I'm sure they'd happy \"chat with\" anyone who doesn't have a Coinbase account who happens to call, too. \"Oh, you don't have a Coinbase account? No problem, we'll get this cleared up for you. Can you just confirm your Social Security number for us, so we can make sure you're really not in our system?\"What to do when you get a suspicious textsIt can be tempting to respond to these texts once you know they are scams, especially when the goal is to simply waste the scammer's time. But as fun as that can be, my advice is to ignore these texts whenever you receive them. While the immediate risks are diminished once you know the \"rep\" is really malicious, responding to these texts lets the scammer know your number is active, and, in response, they might file it away for a future scam attempt. Scammers can also be clever. If you're not careful, you might give away more information than you realize while you're \"messing\" with them. Part of a phishing scheme is establishing a rapport: The scammer wants to lull you into a false sense of security so you give them personal details that might help them steal your info or break into accounts.  The best thing you can do is to delete these texts whenever you receive them. If your messaging app of choice gives you the option to report the text as spam, all the better.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Not only can you control what they listen to, their music choices won't reflect in or affect your listening history. Congratulations: You're getting your Wrapped back.    On Tuesday, Spotify announced it is rolling out managed accounts for Premium subscribers to seven new regions: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Premium Family subscribers in these countries can now create managed accounts for users younger than 13 that allow those users to listen on their own, in a controlled environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nManaged accounts are music-only, so younger listeners can't browse Spotify's other offerings, such as podcasts, or send or receive DMs. In addition, account managers can control a number of settings on these accounts, including whether the account can listen to explicit music, choose to block specific artists and songs, and decide to hide video—including short-form Canvas content.While Spotify has an existing service designed for children, Spotify Kids, it's much different, as it only contains music hand-picked for the service, and doesn't allow subscribers to control the account. Managed accounts allow subscribers to give a full Spotify experience to their kids, while having total control over what they can listen to. Personally, I think this is a fantastic feature. As someone who grew up in the early days of iTunes, I would have loved the ability to add whatever songs I wanted to my playlists—assuming my parents gave those songs the OK, of course. It's also great that kids can get recommendations for new music from Spotify. If they are obsessed with the latest trending song, perhaps Spotify can recommend similar tunes, both contemporary tracks as well as classics. It could be a great way to expand kids' music tastes.   Spotify first tested managed accounts in 10 other countries: New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Columbia. It's now available as part of its Premium Family plan, which costs $19.99 per month.   How to create a managed accountIf you're using the Spotify mobile app, head to Settings and privacy > Account > Premium Family. If you're on your account page on Spotify's website, choose \"Manage members.\" Either way, under Plan members, choose to add members to your plan. Choose \"Add a listener aged under 13,\" then choose \"Add account.\"You'll then follow the on-screen steps to confirm you are the parent or guardian of the listener; set a PIN to control the experience; choose the name and birthdate of the listener; and choose your settings. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. A number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

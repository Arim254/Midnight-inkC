ANC has a time and a place, but being able to be aware of my surroundings and have conversations with my wife while working from home has made 2025 more enjoyable. I owe that to the Shokz Open Run Pro 2, which are bone conduction headphones that leave your ears uncovered. But if you prefer true wireless earbuds that have the same benefit, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are a great alternative, and right now, they're on sale for $139.95 (originally $199.95).\nUnlike the Shokz Open Run Pro 2, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are not bone conduction headphones; instead, the sound is projected toward your ears (think of it like small speakers next to your ears). This means, like bone conduction headphones, your ears are not plugged by any earbuds. They simply rest on them, allowing you to use your ears to their full potential. The OpenFit 2+ comes with some cool features. They have Dolby cinematic sound, which is an immersive sound feature that frees sound channels, making directional sound clearer (almost like surround sound). If you like to watch movies or shows with your earbuds, this is a huge plus. The design fits snug on your ears, so you don't have to worry about them falling off, regardless of how intense your workouts get. The Shokz companion app is excellent, and gives you a lot of freedom with the EQ, so you can tweak the settings to optimize podcasts or a bass-heavy format when you need that extra motivation in the gym. You can expect about 11 hours of battery life with another 48 hours from the charging case. You can also charge them wirelessly through the case.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're looking to disconnect from ANC headphones in 2026, the Shokz OpenFit 2+ are a great option with this 30% discount.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        The holidays are for rest, relaxation, and eating your weight in cookies shaped like reindeer. Your fitness goals can absolutely wait until the new year. But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.These are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed. Tactical door-closed push-ups (10-15 reps)These are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.Spite squats (20 reps)Do some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking. Frustration lunges (10 per leg)Lunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes! \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.Diplomatic plank hold (30-60 seconds)Hold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPassive-aggressive mountain climbers (30 seconds)Quick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor. Peacekeeper glute bridges (15-20 reps)Lie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.Zen bicycle crunches (20 total)Finish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center. Cool downSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Rido - Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        The more you work out, the fitter you'll get. Your VO2max, sometimes described on wearables as a \"cardio fitness\" score, is a number that tends to be higher among people who are more cardiovascularly fit. But it's not the only measure of fitness, and you should know what it really means. What VO2max really is (as measured in a lab)Smartwatches and fitness trackers don't actually measure VO2max; they just estimate it. To actually find your VO2max, you'd need to go to an exercise lab and do a test on a treadmill or cycle while hooked up to equipment that measures your heart rate and the air you're exhaling. I did exactly this kind of test to compare my real VO2max to the numbers reported by nine different devices. You can read about my experience, and why it matters, here. VO2max, properly rendered VO2max, is the maximal volume (V) of oxygen (O2) your body can use per minute during exercise, scaled to your body size because larger people will naturally use more oxygen. This is considered a good measure of aerobic fitness because—think back to high school biology—your body uses oxygen and food to create a usable form of chemical energy called ATP. You then use that ATP to power the movements of your muscles. The amount of oxygen directly correlates with the amount of energy produced. Or, in simpler terms, the more work you do, the more oxygen you need.So a person who is aerobically very fit—let’s say an elite marathon runner—can do more work (run faster) than somebody who isn’t. As a result, they’ll suck in a lot more oxygen per minute during their run than, say, I would.What is a \"good\" VO2max? A typical sorta-fit human being will have a VO2max somewhere in the 30s or 40s. If you exercise a lot, you can push that number higher. Elite cyclists, skiers, and ultrarunners may have numbers in the 70s or 80s, and a few people out there have scored in the 90s. I'd call myself a recreational athlete (I run a little) and my lab-tested VO2max was 43. Most of my fitness wearables reported numbers for me in the high 30's or low 40's—a good reminder that these estimates can be useful, but they aren't necessarily correct.Why is a high VO2max good?To be able to use a large amount of oxygen, you need more than just good lungs. You also need a strong heart and healthy circulatory system to get the oxygen to your muscles. And you need muscles that are large and can do a lot of work per minute—which means that you're strong and can do a lot of work athletically. VO2max is a way to summarize a lot of important things about cardio fitness into one simple number.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nBut it’s important to know that this number isn’t everything about fitness, or even aerobic fitness. First, it doesn’t make much sense to compare your VO2max to other people’s, because it’s affected by factors like blood volume and muscle mass. Men tend to have a VO2max about ten points higher than similarly fit women, for example. There are also plenty of aspects of fitness that aren't captured by VO2max. Compare two athletes with the same VO2max, and you may find that one can keep going in an endurance race longer than the other. Or one might be better at sprinting while another is better at medium-effort work. One person may be stronger than another, or have better technique, or be more resistant to injuries. There is research correlating VO2max with longevity, but that doesn't mean that raising your VO2max a few points will add years to your life. Fitness, in general, tends to correlate with longevity and with overall health. Scientists who want to study that relationship will usually pick an easy thing or two to measure, like VO2max or grip strength. But in real life, we don't have to choose one number to maximize; we can work on multiple aspects of fitness. It's better to be well-rounded than to hyperfocus on just one metric. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow can you measure your own VO2max?The gold standard is a lab test. High-level athletes will sometimes take this test if they or their coach want to know their actual, definite VO2max number. But we can measure aerobic fitness in other ways, and there are workouts you can do to get a good estimate of VO2max. If you’re a runner, you can look up a recent race time on this chart to find your VDOT, which roughly correlates with your VO2max. (My best-ever mile time gets me a VDOT of 38, for example.)To estimate your VO2max from a workout, you need something that will take you to your absolute maximum aerobic output. A race does this job nicely; so will a test like running as many laps of a track as you can in 12 minutes. I recall doing a test in a Phys Ed. class once where we had to step up and down from a high box as many times as possible. These tests aren’t pleasant, but their results can be a benchmark to tell you whether you’re improving your fitness over time. How watches measure VO2maxSmartwatches and fitness trackers typically estimate VO2max by comparing your heart rate during exercise to a measure of how much work you're doing during that exercise. Most often, this is through outdoor running or walking. The speed you run or walk is measured through GPS, and the device compares that to your heart rate. If you can run fast with a low heart rate, you must be pretty fit and your VO2max will be estimated as being pretty high. If your heart rate is high even for a slow running or walking pace, your VO2max is lower. These estimates aren't always accurate. If your max heart rate isn't set properly in the device's settings, if it's hot out, if your running route has hills, or if you don't happen to get out for outdoor runs or walks very often, your VO2max is more likely to be wrong. That said, your VO2max estimate doesn't have to be exactly correct to be useful. If the number increases over time, you're probably getting fitter. And if it decreases, you're likely losing fitness. \n            \n    ",

Until now, Bevel required a $5.99/month (or $49.99/year) subscription. That said, the paid tier isn't going away completely.What does Bevel do?You can read my review of Bevel here, but in brief, it’s a tracking app that uses data from your Apple Watch (and other devices) to give you a Whoop-style dashboard that collects your health data in one place and analyzes it. Bevel can give you advice about how recovered it thinks you are, and how your habits affect your health metrics. While the Apple Watch can collect a lot of data, Apple has never built an app that integrates everything in a friendly, easily readable way. That integrated dashboard is where Apple Watch competitors like Whoop and Oura shine, and using Bevel (or one of its competitors, like Athlytic) gives a similar experience. What’s free in Bevel (and what’s the catch?) According to announcements Bevel made on Instagram and Reddit, an update rolling out this week makes all features of Bevel free except Bevel Intelligence, their AI feature. The company says this is because AI is more expensive for it to provide. Free features include everything else: “all historical data, Nutrition, Strength Builder, Sleep Alarm, and much more.” \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe company also hinted that two things are likely coming in 2026: more features (specifics not yet announced) and a price hike. Customers who currently subscribe to an annual plan will be grandfathered in to the 2026 plans at the same price they currently pay. There’s not enough information to know whether next year’s plans, which the company is calling “Bevel 3.0,” will be worth the subscription fee, whatever it happens to be. But I can say that the features of regular Bevel are definitely worth a try, especially at no cost. Bevel collects data from almost any health app that links to Apple Health, and can track a multitude of metrics, including strength training by muscle group, cardio load, recovery scores, and habit tracking. Most other wearables collect this information in their own apps, but if you wear an Apple Watch, Bevel is one of the best ways to consolidate it all.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: @dougdescendant, @brainrotclipzai, @skrilla-TikTok, Youtube\n                            \n    \n            \n            \n        \n            A weekly deep dive into the current trends, slang, and viral videos of youth culture in terms that even the squarest can understand.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        2025 is limping to a merciful end, so I'm taking a look back at the year in slang. Below are ten examples of youth patois, chosen for both their popularity and for what they reveal about generations A and Z. Like most slang, these words and phrases evolved over time, so while many didn't first appear in 2025, but this is the year they gained popularity.  (If you want a more complete list of youth slang, check out my guide to Gen Z and Alpha slang.) 6-7By far the most popular slang word of 2025 was \"6-7.\" These two previously unremarkable numerals rose to unprecedented popularity with young people this year, to the consternation of legions of educators and parents.  It's perfect Gen A slang because it doesn't have a literal meaning, like a lot of younger people culture, but it's a sort of self-contained joke. Often, the idea is to use the phrase in conversation: if someone asks how tall you are, what you scored on a test, or what time it is, you might respond “six-seeeeeven.” Hilarious.6-7 took off when Philadelphia artist Skrilla released \"Doot Doot (6 7)\" in February. \nFrom there, it was repeated in schoolyards and TikTok posts for no reason except maybe that it's fun to say. In a month or two, 6-7 reached full slang saturation, and everyone learned what it means (or doesn't mean).  Dictionary.com named 6-7 its word of the year. It spawned spin-off numbers like 41 and 93. Older people waited for it to end, but 6-7 didn't end. We're almost a year in, and kids are still saying it constantly. So it means something to them. But what? 6-7's lack of literal meaning highlights the difficulty of defining a generation that seems uninterested in (or unable to) define itself.BrainrotBrainrot describes online content, usually videos and meme images, that are stupid and meaninglessness. They're generally loud and assaultive, too: Brainrot is not subtle. It also described the supposed effect that consuming this kind of material has on kids. One of the earliest and most well known pieces of brainrot is \"Skibiddi Toilet,\" a series of YouTube videos that has billions of views. The genre has evolved from there, and now often consists of reframing and remixing obscure memes to create content that is almost entirely absent of meaning, like this Italian brainrot. Younger kids particularly spend a ton of time watching brainrot content, so it is likely shaping the collective worldview of Generation Alpha, but it's hard to say what the result will be. Slop\"Slop\" describes the hundreds of millions of cheesy-looking, unsettling, AI-generated images, videos, and songs that have hit the internet since artificial intelligence gained popularity over the last couple years. Ease of production means that slop is rapidly taking over human-produced content, and younger people will live in a slop-dominated future. As a generation, they may have more intellectual and artistic connection to machines than they will with other humans. MasonA Mason (or Mason 67 Kid) is a white, suburban Gen Alpha boy who plays baseball, rocks a fluffy “ice cream” haircut, and says \"6-7\" a lot. His sunglasses are Pit Vipers. He wears Yeezy slides. His polyester-as-hell ice cream shorts can be purchased at Dick's Sporting Goods. There's no way to know whether the word \"Mason\" will resonate enough to be remembered later, but it is, as far as I know, the first popular slang term to describe a dominant subculture in Generation Alpha. If it sticks around, it could be the equivalent of describing Boomers as \"hippies\" or Gen X as \"slackers.\" \"Reheating your own nachos\"\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThis slang phrase describes artists whose new works are seen as trying to recapture what was good about their previous artistic output. It's not a widely used phrase outside of online fandom communities, but I'm including it to represent the kind of hyper-specific slang that comes from the relative rarity of shared cultural experiences among young people. They're balkanized, and every fandom, hobby, and interest group has its own language that is often not understood outside of the specific group. SendyAn adjective that describes a person who does bold and/or exciting things, \"sendy\" is often used in the  phrase \"let’s get sendy,\" which means something like “let’s do something big/crazy.” It also often means \"Iet's get drunk.\" It's an example of a slang word coming from a niche community and spreading into the larger culture.It started in rock-climbing communities in the '80s or '90s, where “ascend it\" was shortened to \"send it\" and used to encourage people to \"go for it. \"Send it\" was then adopted by skaters, snowboarders, and other action-sports fans, and eventually slid into the mainstream culture when it was used in this video from influencers The Nelk Boys. Being able to so often pinpoint the exact source of a slang word is another unique feature of Gens Z and A. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n\n80/20 rule80/20 can refer to various scientific and organization principles, but that's not how kids usually use it. An axiom popular in online incel spaces, the 80/20 rule is the idea that 80% of women only date the \"top\" 20% of men. The \"male loneliness epidemic\" and increased social isolation resulted in many younger men accepting controversial, unproven ideas like this as empirical truth, and they have spread from online communities of misfits to the general population of Generations A and Z. Performative maleThis insult is aimed at young men whose tastes, hobbies, and lifestyle are seen as a performance aimed at obtaining societal approval, especially the approval of young women. Like the 80/20 rule, \"performative male\" came from online spaces dominated by incels, and has since spread to the larger culture and expanded in meaning to the point that even reading in public is seen as performative. The problem with \"performative male\" is that it only refers to one kind of performance. The opposite performance of masculinity—the \"Alpha male\" envisioned by Andrew Tate and various lesser Tate-lets—is thus seen as genuine. It's an illustration of younger people's growing toxic masculinity as well as the strict policing of self-expression that comes from every public moment ending in potentially viral online ridicule. Aura farmingThe flip side of the \"performative male,\" aura farming is intentionally cultivating and projecting a cool, charismatic, or impressive image and getting away with it. It's generally seen as a good thing: Someone who is succeeding at their public \"performance\" of the self and actually coming across as cool to others is aura farming. Although one of pitfalls of aura farming is trying too hard, an experience that isn't native to younger generations—in the past, you might have called it \"being a poser.\" \"Beez in the trap\"\"Beez\" means something like \"I am always\" and \"trap\" comes from \"trap house,\" but has a more broader meaning like \"place of business.\" So \"beez in the trap\" means something like \"I am at the place of business, hustling,\" but I'm not including it here for the words, but for how they took off online in 2025 and what it says about young people.  The rest of the slang in this column paints a fairly bleak picture of youth, but we shouldn't forget the creativity, passion, and heart that also defines Generations Z and A. \"Beez in the trap\" is an example of how younger people are re-mixing and re-shaping the culture we've left them into something of their own that is often amazing. The meme works like this: Two people stand back to back. Person one passionately lip-syncs the chorus of 4 Non Blonde's song, \"What's Going On.\" The camera rotates to person two, who chimes in with Nicki Minaj's less existentially angsty track. It's one of those things that just sparks joy in a way that defies explanation and is quintessentially \"young person in 2025.\" Enjoy: \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    ",

Not only do endless emails bog you down and keep you stuck in a loop of endless replies, but the stress of even having to wade through both the important messages and the junk is enough to make you avoid your inbox altogether. There's a reason \"answer emails\" is always the example I use for a tedious-but-important task when I'm explaining more complicated, detailed productivity techniques.But there are smaller techniques you can apply directly to email management, too. To stay on top of your work, school, and personal correspondence, you need a productivity plan, but it doesn't have to be intense: You can try the simple “touch” rules of inbox management.Start reframing how you think of every email you get and consider them each an immediate priority. Crucially, I only mean the email itself is a priority; if you think too hard about this, you'll get overwhelmed fast. You don’t have to do whatever task is outlined in it the moment it arrives, but you do have to open it. The “one-touch” rule is similar to the “two-minute” rule of productivity in that way: A task that takes less than two minutes to complete should be done right away.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nOpen the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. This method works best for people who get a lot of emails that aren’t necessary to respond to, like all-staff updates. The goal is to touch it once instead of coming back to it repeatedly and deliberating if and when you’ll respond or deal with it or instead of procrastinating, never opening it, and being unaware of its contents (or even existence) when you actually need to know what it said. Open it, take in the information, send feedback if necessary, and be done with it.The two-touch ruleIf you tend to have a lot of emails that need a response and the one-touch rule isn't working well, you can move on to a “two-touch” method to clear your mind and be more productive. On the first touch of the email, decide if you need to respond to it right away (making it one-touch) or it’s something that can or should be responded to later in the week.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse your email service’s flagging or snoozing functions to categorize it, so it is available to you easily when you’re ready to respond. Your first touch is still opening it right away—that’s key. Letting emails pile up is overwhelming, but opening them right away will help you maintain peace in your inbox. Designating a specific time to respond to non-urgent messages will also free you up to be more productive, as you’ll know you’ll get it done and won’t feel it weighing on you. Make sure you schedule time into your week to circle back on the flagged emails. Try building a 3-3-3 list to manage your to-dos, designating one of your three medium-sized or small tasks to opening all those saved messages.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Anker's Soundcore Sleep A20 are exactly that: earbuds designed to block out excess noise without pressing uncomfortably against your ear. I've been using them for a year and can't recommend them enough. Right now, these sleep earbuds are on sale for $107.99 (originally $179.99)—that is the lowest price they've been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe Sleep A20 are not active noise-cancelling earbuds, which is how they're able to have such a small, unobtrusive form factor. Instead, they use the in-ear seal to create a natural noise blocker, which, in my opinion, works well enough to block out sounds. They fit quite comfortably and don't press against your ear when you sleep on your side. Very rarely do I wake up with one of them lost in the covers after falling off during the night, but it does happen occasionally (you can use the Find Device feature, which emits a loud sound through the earbuds). The battery life is 14 hours on sleep mode, which includes sounds from the Soundcore app (think white noise or relaxing sounds). If you have it in Bluetooth mode, where you can listen to Spotify or whatever else you want, the battery will last eight hours, but the charging case gives it a total life of up to 80 hours between plug-ins.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe companion app is great, with many useful features for sleeping. You can turn your earbuds off after a set amount of time, have a sleep tracker that records your sleep data, a smart volume feature that increases or decreases in volume depending on the sound in your room, full EQ, and other features. \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Vigni Michael - Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        You know the scenario: You have a bunch of unread emails . The more that come in, the more anxious you get—and the more you procrastinate on sorting through them. How do you decide which ones to reply to and in what order? Even when the amount of unreads isn't overwhelming, your choice can determine how your workday will go. In general, you should choose a side between a last in, first out (LIFO) or first in, first out (FIFO) approach—and, in my opinion, the best choice is LIFO.What are LIFO and FIFO?LIFO and FIFO are terms that come from the financial world—respectively, they stand for “last in, first out” and “first in, first out.” They’re often used by accountants to describe inventory but can refer to anything where items are coming “in,” like, well, emails. In this context, it refers to the practice of responding to either your oldest or your newest unreads first, then working your way in the opposite direction from there.Why is LIFO better than FIFO for email management?LIFO, or the practice of answering the most recent emails before older ones, is more common than FIFO for good reason: Your most recent emails are the ones most likely to be time-sensitive, relevant, or actively blocking someone else’s work as they go unanswered. Meanwhile, the older a message gets, the higher the odds are that the window for a perfect response has already closed. At that point, stressing over it doesn’t magically make you more punctual, it just slows you down. Focusing on what’s right in front of you helps you stay responsive and on top of your current workload, which is usually what your job (or life) actually rewards.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n\"But what if I left the older ones too long?\" you worry. Don't—if something from the past is truly urgent or important, you’ll get a follow-up and, even though that might be embarrassing for you, it’ll bump the older content at hand into LIFO territory anyway. LIFO essentially relies on the idea that the older problems will sort themselves out or be brought back to your attention if they have to be. It’s like giving yourself grace on what you missed and focusing instead on what you can take care of right now. It works best if you rely on it when you have to, but commit to dealing with incoming mail in a more timely way going forward. If you miss too many emails and have to get too many follow-ups, your reputation will take a hit. That's why LIFO works best in general: Once you create the habit of responding to the last-in, you'll eventually stop having first-in messages at all.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, there might be times when you don’t get a follow-up or really do miss something important from the past. One day a week or so, use the time that you’ve blocked out for your email management to work in FIFO mode, going through your emails reverse-chronologically to make sure you didn’t miss anything big. Using FIFO too consistently can have negative consequences, though. If you’re always working on tasks from the past, you risk missing newer, more urgent ones that need immediate attention. Save it for one day every once in a while and use your time to handle pressing matters on a day-to-day basis.An important element of either strategy is timing. Make sure to block out time for email management every day, ideally using a scheduling tactic like timeboxing. Dedicating specific, uninterrupted time to your inbox management makes it more doable and ensures you’ll actually handle the emails in the first place, whereas answering them sporadically through the day opens you up to the possibility of being distracted or procrastinating more frequently. If you're struggling to adopt a LIFO mindset, consider the \"one-touch\" method. With this more intense approach, you commit to opening every email as soon as you get it. It will force you to build a habit that results in you never letting any email get away from you. Open the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. Schedule any required tasks into your to-do list, then keep on moving. You're more likely to get the task done when you need to simply by virtue of being readily aware of it because you opened the message as soon as it came in.\n            \n    ",

IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network. As GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution. Check your IP address for suspicious activityTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure). \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps. As BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

At one point, many major Android devices came with dedicated LEDs that would shine whenever you received a notification. It was a passive way to know whether you had something on your phone to attend to, without having to actually wake up the display and risk getting unnecessarily sucked into your device. iPhones have never had this specific feature, but Apple included a workaround for anyone interested in a similar experience. For years, you've been able to dive into Accessibility settings to turn your iPhone's LED flash into a notification light. Any time you received a text, app notification, or call, your camera flash would go off, ensuring you didn't miss an important update. This can be helpful both those who are hard of hearing, and who wouldn't be able to rely on audible alerts, or anyone who keeps their phone on silent, but would like a visual cue that they have a new notification. For the first time in years, Apple is updating its flash alerts feature. With iOS 26.2, which the company released on Friday, you now have the option to have your iPhone's display itself flash for new alerts. You can choose to make the display the only light that flashes, or to use the feature in tandem with the LED flash, which I think makes the most sense for people who like this option. That way, it won't matter whether your iPhone is face up or face down: You'll always see a light flash for new alerts one way or another. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nDisplay flash doesn't work like you might expect, especially if you've used LED flashes before. I thought my iPhone would flash a bright light on and off again a few times, mimicking how LED flash alerts works. Instead, when you get a new notification, the screen instantly increases the brightness for a few seconds, before lowering it again. It works—you're bound to notice your display jump in brightness if it isn't already maxed out—but it doesn't quite grab your attention as well as the LED flash. How to set up Flash for Alerts on iPhoneTo start, open the Settings app on your iPhone, then head to Accessibility. Scroll down to Hearing, then choose Audio & Visual. Scroll to the bottom of this page, then tap Flash for Alerts.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're running an older version of iOS, you'll only have the option to enable \"LED Flash.\" However, those running iOS 26.2 and newer will also see an option for \"Screen.\" Choose that option if you want the display to flash for new alerts, or \"Both\" to have both lights enabled. You'll also find two choices that affect when these flash alerts go off, no matter which of the above options you pick. First, you can choose whether your iPhone will use flash alerts while locked. If you disable this option, you'll only see these light alerts when your iPhone is unlocked. Second, you can choose whether to use flash alerts in Silent Mode. I'd keep that setting enabled, since it seems most useful when your iPhone has no other way to alert you to new notifications. It's also important to note that using an Apple Watch can complicate this feature a bit, at least in my experience. While giving this option a test, I had trouble getting alerts to come through on my locked phone without first going to my watch. If you have an Apple Watch, and its notifications mirror your iPhone's, you'll get the most out of this feature when your iPhone is unlocked. \n            \n    ",

Your information may have been compromised in a massive breach affecting more than 5.8 million consumers, and you should take the necessary steps to protect your data. 700Credit supplies credit and identity verification services to more than 21,000 vehicle, RV, powersport, and marine dealerships in the U.S., so if you've purchased a vehicle and applied for dealer financing—or even been pre-screened or pre-qualified to do so—your information could have been affected. What happened with 700Credit?According to the company's filing with the Maine Attorney General, 700Credit's systems were hacked between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27. Attackers stole personal information about customers of 700Credit's dealership clients, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and dates of birth. As BleepingComputer reports, this breach was actually a consequence of a system compromise back in July at one of 700Credit's 200 integration partners. Threat actors were able to gain access to an API used to pull consumer data, and a security vulnerability in the API allowed them to exfiltrate information from 700Credit. What you need to doIf you receive a data breach notice from 700Credit, read it carefully. 700Credit is offering 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion's Cyberscout to affected consumers. You will need to go to the URL listed in your notice and enter your unique activation code in order to enroll, and you have 90 days from the date of the letter to complete the process. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n700Credit expects to begin notifying individuals starting on Dec. 22. In addition to utilizing the free credit protection, you should take the usual precautions to lock down your identity: Freeze your credit at all three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion).Place a fraud alert on your credit file. You only need to do this at one bureau, which will apply it to all three. Keep an eye on your financial accounts for suspicious transactions as well as your credit report. Note that if your credit is frozen, thieves shouldn't be able to take out new credit in your name. Request an IP PIN from the IRS to prevent someone from filing a tax return using your SSN. Follow good digital hygiene practices, such as using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. You cannot reverse a data breach, but you can (and should) do damage control. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The latest macOS update (26.2) has a trick for this: you can use the edge of your screen as a ring light.The feature, which adds a rounded white rectangle to your screen, is called Edge Light. The rectangle takes up part of your screen but will become partially transparent if you move your mouse pointer into it, meaning you'll mostly be able to use your computer normally.You can use the feature by clicking the camera icon on the menu bar during a call and toggling on the Edge Light option. You can also adjust the brightness and the color of the edge light from here.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this in a well-lit room and didn't notice much of a difference, which makes sense. In a totally dark room, though, it proved extremely helpful. Here's how I looked without Edge Light:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAs you can see, I'm just barely lit by the laptop itself. Here's how I look with the feature turned on:\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's a lot easier to make out my face, but whether that's a pro or a con is a matter of opinion. Try the feature out if you find yourself on a video call with the lights off. Note that it's only offered on devices with Apple Silicon.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This is why I tend to spend large portions of my reviews talking about price. I love a cutting edge device as much as the next nerd, but I have two kids and I live in the most expensive city in America; as much as I admire the Boox Palma 2 Pro, my budget doesn't really have room for a niche $400 e-reader.That's why the Xteink X4, a minimalist 4.3-inch e-reader, is my tech upgrade of 2025: Here's a device that has no delusions of grandeur. It doesn't want to replace your phone. It doesn't want to serve up the smoothest screen tech. It doesn't want to run games or apps or seamlessly sync with you phone. It just wants to be a tiny, inexpensive e-reader that works just well enough, and is small enough to carry with you anywhere. \nThe simplicity is the pointAs I make clear in my review, the Xteink X4 can in no way compete with the Palma 2 Pro (or your average Kindle, for that matter). It has an underpowered processor and no screen light. Due to digital rights management, you probably won't be able to use it to read all the Kindle books you already own (though that's really Amazon's fault). It's kind of a pain to load it up with e-books, and once you get them on there, they might not look great, as the current software can't even display paragraph indents or italics.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nBut it also costs less than $70 (as little as $45 if you order from AliExpress, a sort of Chinese answer to Amazon Marketplace), and once it's all set up, it fulfills the exact same function as a pricier device: It allows me to easily carry my library around with me so I can read a book instead of staring at my phone. But because it's so very tiny—around 25% smaller and thinner than my iPhone 14—it does this better than any other device I've tried.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore than just functional, though, the Xteink X4 is fun—though admittedly, a lot of that comes from the vibrant community that has sprung up around it online. It has only been available for a few months, but it already has its own active subreddit, filled with geeky users helping each other out with FAQs, troubleshooting, and crowd-sourced galleries of screensaver images. They've developed tools and shortcuts to get around the device's limited functionality, from a Calibre plugin that will optimize your EPUB files for the Xteink X4, to an online tool that will automatically convert them into much prettier image files. A few different folks are even working on entirely new firmware to replace the merely functional native software.You don't have to tinker with the Xteink X4—it's perfectly usable out of the box, once you get used to quirks like navigating its slightly confusing menus with its slightly unintuitive physical buttons—but it's fun to be engaged with a bunch of other people who are excited about making it work better. In their outsized devotion to a niche device, these folks are bringing back the spirit of the old internet, powered by a sense of excitement and community rather than an all-knowing algorithm. Like the current retro appeal of cassette tapes, the Xteink X4 makes everything better by being a little bit worse.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: miss.cabul/Shutterstock \n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        You (hopefully) know by now that you can't take everything AI tells you at face value. Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices. The campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms. How attackers are using ChatGPT Kaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas. However, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.A further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem. Don't trust every command AI generatesIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past. Of course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

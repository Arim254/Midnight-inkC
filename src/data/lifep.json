There are now three levels of membership to go along with the two current hardware devices. I'll explain what they are, and how to decide which one makes the most sense for you. </p><p>Whoop is the screenless fitness tracker that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-40-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>earned four stars in my review of the 4.0 model</u></a> for its integrated fitness and recovery tracking and its handling of strength training. It’s only available by subscription, with the hardware being sort of a bonus that comes with membership. (That said, if you're interested in a screenless wristband that doesn't have the subscription-worthy software, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/amazfit-helio-strap-review\" target=\"_blank\">Amazfit Helio strap</a> is a strong alternative. I have a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/amazfit-helio-strap-vs-whoop\" target=\"_blank\">comparison of the two here</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-in-the-whoop-50-versus-the-mg\">What’s in the Whoop 5.0 versus the MG</h2><p>Whoop's 5.0 device is the current one that comes along with the budget and middle-of-the-road memberships. If you remember the older Whoop 4.0, it's very similar (but a smidge smaller and has more than double the battery life). The 5.0 is the device you get with One ($199/year) and Peak ($239/year) memberships.</p><p>The MG is the \"medical grade\" version of the hardware. It's the same size and shape as the 5.0, with the same sensors, except that it has a metal clasp so it can take ECG readings. (When you take ECG readings, you touch the clasp with one hand while wearing the device on your other wrist, much like the Apple Watch and other ECG-capable wearables.) The MG comes with the $359/year Life membership.</p><p>Both devices charge with a wireless power pack; you charge the power pack over USB-C at your convenience, and then when you want to top up your Whoop's battery, you slide the pack onto the Whoop as you're wearing it. Only members of the Peak and Life tiers get the wireless power pack; the lowest tier membership comes with a wired charger. </p><h2 id=\"what-you-get-with-each-of-the-three-membership-tiers\">What you get with each of the three membership tiers</h2><p>The three new membership tiers are One ($199/year), Peak ($239/year), and Life ($359/year). One is a stripped-down membership, Peak is similar to what Whoop users have right now, and Life is a new offering with extra health features. Here’s the breakdown: </p><h3>Whoop One ($199/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWEREn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=One&short_url=QWEREn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=One\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>One</u></a> is the budget membership. You get a wired charger instead of the wireless power pack, and a “CoreKnit” band, which seems to be a new material that isn’t as nice as the SuperKnit bands offered with the higher tiers.</p><p>If you downgrade to this level, you’ll lose a few features that Whoop members currently all get: the Health Monitor (with its readings of HRV, respiratory rate, resting heart rate, and skin temperature) and the Stress Monitor, which tells you in real time how much stress you seem to be under.</p><h3>Whoop Peak ($239/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9l30vP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Peak&short_url=9l30vP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=Peak\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Peak</a> is the most similar to the single subscription level that was offered with the 4.0, both in price and features. If your subscription renews without you choosing a tier, you’ll end up on Peak. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You’ll also get the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoops-healthspan-feature-expanding-support\" target=\"_blank\">Healthspan feature</a> that tells you your “Whoop age” and your “pace of aging,” and gives recommendations to improve those metrics. </p><h3>Whoop Life ($359/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDgONb?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Life&short_url=aDgONb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=Life\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Life</u></a> is the top tier membership, and comes with the MG rather than 5.0 hardware. It includes everything in Peak, including the Healthspan feature. </p><p>With the MG you can take ECG readings, and this tier also has a feature that claims to estimate your blood pressure. You’ll need to calibrate it with readings from a blood pressure cuff to start using it. This is controversial, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fda-says-whoops-blood-pressure-feature-is-illegal\" target=\"_blank\">the FDA has told Whoop the feature is illegal</a>, but it remains available in the app for now.</p><h2 id=\"what-if-i-have-an-older-device\">What if I have an older device? </h2><p>Whoop memberships still work with the old 4.0 device, and members with a 4.0 still get access to everything the Peak membership offers, including the Healthspan feature. If your membership renews without you choosing a tier, you’ll be rolled into the Peak membership. </p><p>If you don't already own a Whoop device, don't bother getting a 4.0. Sometimes people will try to sell or give away used versions as if they're doing you a favor by giving you a discount. There's nothing wrong with using a 4.0 if you'd like to keep another device out of the landfill, but it won't save you any money personally. To use a Whoop device is to pay Whoop for a membership, and you get a 5.0 (or MG) device free when you start or renew a membership. </p>\n            </article>",

Early access was initially reserved to a waitlist of Perplexity Max users, a subscription that costs $200 per <em>month</em>, before Perplexity opened up access to Perplexity Pro users, who only need to pay $20 per month. Still, seeing as most web browsers are free to use, I imagine most people still shied away from trying Comet because of the price.</p><p>If that sounds like you, there's good news. On Friday, Perplexity made Comet available to anyone who wants to try it for free. You don't need to subscribe to any Perplexity plan, nor do you even need a Perplexity account—though the company has some features tied to those who sign in. Comet is built on Chromium, so if you're coming from Chrome, or another Chromium browser like Edge, you'll be able to jump right in. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Installing Comet is as easy as any other web browser: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">just head to Perplexity's website</a>, and choose \"Download Comet.\" Even setting up the browser feels familiar, as you can import another Chrome profile, choose a profile pic, and set a name. But of course, the real advertised advantage here is the AI assistant. Like other AI-powered browsers, Comet has a built-in chatbot you can talk to about whatever it is you want—particularly the web pages you happen to be browsing. But Comet's AI is agentic, which means you can ask the AI to do things for you. </p><p>If you ask it to take you to a specific website, it will (though I'm not sure that's any faster than simply typing in the site by hand). If you ask it to open a specific link on the page, you can see the bot take over the page, and choose the URL you asked for. For example, I asked the assistant to open Lifehacker, then asked it to click on our article \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-browse-the-dark-web\" target=\"_blank\">How to Browse the Dark Web</a>.\" It did both of these things, and even offered a summary of the dark web piece.  </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But Perplexity says you can also request more complex tasks: According to the company, the assistant can draft emails on your behalf, build websites, make purchases, create citations, add to your calendar. There's even a voice mode, as with other AI bots like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-is-out-now\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/gemini-live-is-now-available-to-all-android-users-for-free\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, so you can talk to the browser if you want to. </p><p>I'm still not sold on the idea that injecting agentic AI into my web browser is what I need to better experience the internet. Maybe I need to spend some time with Comet to experience that \"future.\" But seeing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+hallucination+lifehacker&udm=14\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">how often the tech still makes mistakes</a>—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/prompt-injection-attacks-ai-browsers\" target=\"_blank\">not the mention the untapped security risks</a>—I'm not sure I want to hand off all of my browsing tasks to AI just yet. Still, if you're interested, you can give it a go without spending a dime.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Studies have suggested writing by hand helps you retain information better than using a computer, which is why <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">you should only bring a notebook and pen</a> with you to class in addition to (or instead of) your laptop. </p><p>But there’s more to effective note-taking than jotting down a bunch of bullet points. To be useful, your notes should be organized into topics and subtopics, with a sensible flow that you’ll be able to follow later. That’s why you should revise your notes immediately after class—even before you leave your seat, if you can. </p></div><h2 id=\"what-to-do-with-notes-after-class\">What to do with notes after class</h2><p>When you’re taking notes—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">whether typed or hand-written</a>—you have to be picky about what you do and don’t write down, given how much time it takes to do so before the lecturer moves on to another point you don’t want to miss. This is great for helping you stay engaged with the class and think critically about what is and isn’t important, but leaves the potential for gaps in your notes that you won’t realize are there until later, once you’re reading them over. So it’s best to read them over right away, and revise them as necessary.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Marty Lobdell, a former professor emeritus at Pierce College who spent 40 years teaching psychology and study skills, recommends immediate note revision and expansion in his “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Study Less, Study Smart</a>” video. While the lecture is fresh in your mind, he advises, you should use your memory of it, plus your texts and other course materials, to expand on the notes you took down.</p><p>Rewrite them completely, adding key details to what you already deemed was important in class, including anything relevant in the supplemental materials. Doing so will not only make your notes easier to study later, but will help you retain the information, since rewriting them will be your first chance to review what you’ve learned.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-maximize-your-post-class-notes\">How to maximize your post-class notes</h2><p>While taking notes in class, it’s best to be brief and concise, especially since you know you’ll be expanding them later. You can <a href=\"https://sites.austincc.edu/student-skills-workshops/taking-effective-notes/notetaking-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">use abbreviations and codes to write faster</a>, as long as you’re sure you’ll be able to decode and expand upon them later. After class, review and edit your notes, compare them to your textbook or course materials, and, if possible, another student’s notes, so you’re sure you’re not missing anything.</p><p>While writing initially and when revising, choose<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\"> the most effective note-taking method for your personal study style</a>. The outlining method works best for recopying and involves putting general information on the left side of your paper and indenting more specific groups of facts underneath. For your in-class note-taking, consider the Cornell method, which requires you to write down quick bits of information on the left side of your paper, then fill in more specifics on the right when you have time later.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Whichever method you choose, don’t leave class until your note expansion is complete (or, if that’s not realistic, take care of it as soon as possible after class). Review your notes between and 10 minutes before the next class so everything is fresh in your mind before you move on.</p><h2 id=\"ideas-for-better-notes-and-revision\">Ideas for better notes and revision</h2><p>Taking notes using an established method, like Cornell, is your best bet, since it gives you a little structure while you go. The way you revise them is important, too. I recommend reformatting them <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">into a mind map</a>. This is a visual representation of how concepts work together. Reminiscent of a flowchart, it uses bubbles, colors, and arrows to denote related topics and subtopics. Here, you can call on tech for backup. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">I like the Xmind app</a> for creating simple, fast mind maps. </p><p>The benefits of revising this way are numerous. First, you force yourself not just to focus on topics and concepts, but on how they all fit together, which helps entrench them in your mind and enhance your understanding overall. Second, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">adding in some color</a> or intrigue helps with retention, too. Third, forcing yourself to reformat the notes in a completely different way than you took them makes you think differently about them and focus on getting everything right.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

This measurement is the basis for recovery scores and stress readings, and you can usually find it as a standalone measurement in the “vitals” section of your chosen app. So let’s break down what this number actually measures, and how to interpret yours. </p><h2 id=\"hrv-is-heart-rate-variability\">HRV is heart rate variability</h2><p>HRV stands for heart rate variability, but that doesn’t mean what you might think. HRV is <em>not</em> related to your heart rate changing throughout the day or during exercise. (Your heart beats faster when you’re exercising hard, which is what <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate zones</u></a> measure. Totally different purpose.) </p>\n<p>Heart rate variability refers to <em>how rhythmically</em> your heart beats. If the time from one beat to the next is always the same (at a given heart rate), you have low HRV. But if some heartbeats come more closely together, and some are more spaced out, you have high HRV. </p><p>This may be surprising, but you actually <em>want</em> your heart rate to show some variation. High HRV is considered to be better than low HRV. Your fitness app will say you’re well recovered if your HRV was higher than usual last night, and it will say you’re stressed or not recovering well if your HRV was low. </p><p>That said, it’s of course possible to have a heart rate that is <em>too</em> variable. In a sense, that’s what an arrhythmia is. When I’m talking about HRV here—and when fitness apps report your HRV—they’re considering the teeny tiny differences from beat to beat in an otherwise normal(ish) healthy(ish) person. </p><p>These differences are measured in milliseconds, and you wouldn’t notice them if you didn’t have a watch sampling data while you sleep. If you ever notice anything wildly strange about the rhythm of your heart, ask your doctor (or seek emergency medical help, if appropriate). </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-high-hrv-mean\">What does a high HRV mean? </h2><p>High heart rate variability (that is, high <em>for you</em>) tends to mean that you’re relatively relaxed and not too stressed. Fitness apps will bump up your readiness and recovery scores when your HRV measured during sleep is high. </p><p>The variation in beats is thought to come from the push and pull of two different body systems, the sympathetic (“fight or flight”) and parasympathetic (“rest and digest”) nervous systems. It’s normal for your brain and body to be balancing these needs, so this is considered a good, normal functioning. </p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-low-hrv-mean\">What does a low HRV mean? </h2><p>Low HRV tends to occur when your body is working on something—recovering from hard exercise, fighting off a cold, experiencing lots of stress. If your HRV measured during sleep is low, you’ll get lower readiness or recovery scores. I find my HRV tanks when I’m sick or when I’ve been through a rough time either physically or mentally. (The day after a race or a weightlifting competition is always a low HRV day for me.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-good-hrv-number\">What is a “good” HRV number? </h2><p>I’ll give you some numbers in a minute, but the most important thing to know is that HRV is most useful when you compare readings to <em>what is normal for you</em>. Your HRV can be higher than mine, but still low for you, or vice versa. </p><p>So please don’t go around asking whether an HRV of 50 is “good.” Is it higher than usual <em>for you</em>? Then it’s good. Is it lower than usual for you? Then maybe it’s indicating that your body is under stress. If your typical HRV readings range from 35 to 50 (for example), then 50 is high for you. </p><p>It doesn’t matter whether the average person your age has a HRV of 20 or of 100; those numbers are just fun facts about the population in general. They don’t apply to you. Studies tend to show that fitter people have higher HRV, but also that HRV declines as we age. The average man’s HRV is slightly higher than the average woman’s, but the full range of what’s “normal” for each gender almost fully overlaps.</p><p>There’s one more important caveat: when you look up HRV data, you’ll find that different studies and different devices each measure HRV differently. For example, <a href=\"https://doctaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/A_Quantitative_Systematic_Review_of_Normal_Values_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this meta-analysis</u></a> found the average HRV was 42, with a range of 19 to 75, when measured as rMSSD (root mean square of successive differences). </p><p>So—and remember this is just for fun, here are some graphs from two wearable companies that publish their data <em>and</em> they both use rMSSD:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/normal-hrv-range-age-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Whoop’s breakdown of HRV data from their users</u></a> finds men have an average of 40 and women 37. They have graphs breaking down how this changes with age, and showing the variation for each group. </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/average-hrv/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Oura’s breakdown of HRV from their users</u></a> finds an average of 41 across all users, and they also graph it by age and gender. </p></li></ul><p>As I’ve found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-fitness-tracker-measure-hrv\" target=\"_blank\"><u>when comparing multiple devices on HRV</u></a>, devices don’t always report the same HRV numbers, but usually you can follow similar trends on all of them. If you’re sick, they’ll all report low HRV. If you have a good day, they’ll all report high HRV. So pay more attention to the trend than the specifics.</p>\n            </article>",

It's a signifier of my progression through Club Peloton, a new member recognition program that comes with some solid rewards.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-club-peloton\">What is Club Peloton?</h2><p>Club Peloton is a new ranking system that's meant to reflect a person's efforts and participation with Peloton workouts. Progress is applied retroactively (good news for my 201-day streak) which means I've achieved the rank of Silver III. The ranks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Silver (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Gold (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Champion</p></li><li><p>Legend</p></li></ul><p>Within each of the first three ranks, there are three tiers, and Champion and Legend each stand alone, so there are 11 levels to work through overall. </p><p>Importantly, you can never be demoted on Club Peloton; you can only move up. If you miss a week's worth of workouts while you're in Bronze III, you won't log in to find that you've been bumped down to Bronze II. It's meant to encourage you, not shame you. </p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-earn-points\">How do you earn points?</h2><p>The purpose of this new ranking system is to encourage members, make people try new things, and give recognition and rewards to participants. The methods of earning points demonstrate that. Here's what you can do to rise the ranks:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Earn two points for each day you work out with Peloton, whether using the company's equipment, its app, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strength+.</a></p></li><li><p>Earn points corresponding to your weekly streaks, so three points for a three-week streak, etc. If you work out two weeks in a row, you'll get two points. If you work out 40 weeks in a row, that week is going to end with a 40-point boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for yearly streaks, too. If you work out 52 weeks in a row, you end up with a year-long streak, which earns you double points. Instead of 52 points at the end of that year, you get 104. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for milestones. Milestones can be found on your Peloton profile and include things like taking 10 or 25 of a certain kind of class. When you achieve a milestone in a second activity beyond one you've already got one in, you get a 10% boost. Milestones in three or more give you a 20% boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for participating in programs. Every week you are actively involved in one, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton's FTP program</a>, you get two points. You get one point for every class you complete in your new, AI-generated personal plan and 10 points any time you undertake a Peloton challenge. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for being a team player. Every week, you can earn up to one point each for giving someone a virtual high five during class, taking a live class, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a Team</a>. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-are-the-ranks-calculated\">How are the ranks calculated?</h2><p>Want to know how many points are required to raise your rank? Here's the breakdown:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze is your level if you have zero to 99 points.</p></li><li><p>Silver is for 100 to 1,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Gold covers 2,000 points to 14,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Champion is 15,000 to 29,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Legend is for anyone with over 30,000 points.</p></li></ul><p>Like I said, I'm on a daily streak that stretches almost two-thirds of a year and I'm only in Silver III with just 1,205 points and 795 to go until I hit Gold I. You can tap into your point history to see a breakdown of how you got to where you are. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-all-this\">What is the point of all this?</h2><p>To me, this is awesome, but I am a well-known lover of all manner of streak-based app gimmicks. I will do anything for the pleasure of a digital badge, like go to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">Dunkin' Donuts every day</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/finch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">keep track of my to-do list</a> on an app that forces me to report my progress to a little cartoon bird. Simply put, I find it motivating to compete for something, even if I'm just competing with myself to earn what amounts to little more than pixels. </p><p>Club Peloton, however, amounts to more than that: The company promises that as you work through ranks, you'll unlock \"surprises.\" Future surprises notwithstanding, some of the rewards are already known. You can get early access to new classes or challenges, discounts on apparel or other retail goods, instructor shoutouts during class, and invitations to exclusive in-person events. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

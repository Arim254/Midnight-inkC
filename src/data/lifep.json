The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The scheme, a recent iteration of a ClickFix attack, is designed to trick you into executing a dangerous command under the guise of completing a \"critical security update.\" But what you're actually doing is installing an infostealer that hands data over to bad actors. When a Windows update pop-up is actually a ClickFix attackClickFix is a social engineering ploy that uses tactics like fake error messages, CAPTCHA forms, and command prompts to deliver malware to your device. As PCMag reports, the Windows update scam is a pop-up that looks like a standard Windows blue screen but is actually a full screen browser page being displayed from a malicious domain. The ClickFix element is a set of keystrokes—not part of the real update interface—that have the user paste and execute a malicious command, ultimately delivering malware to their device. These instructions have an air of urgency, which is a common element of a scam. \nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Huntress have detailed the exact mechanism behind this attack, including an iteration in which users are prompted to verify they are human (rather than complete a security update). As Bleeping Computer outlines, the malicious code is embedded into the pixel data of PNG images, and the final payload is one of two known infostealers.According to the Huntress analysis, following a recent law enforcement operation, fake Windows update pages continue to exist across multiple domains, but those domains no longer seem to host the malware payload. That doesn't mean, however, that this attack, or some version of it, won't pop up elsewhere. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to stay safe from this ClickFix attackIf you run Windows on your device, you've probably seen a blue or black update or error screen many times, and you may not be suspicious if your computer randomly begins an update or prompts you to take an extra step to confirm it. But while a legitimate update screen will have a progress indicator and instructions not to turn off your computer, you should never need to input manual commands. This is a red flag of a ClickFix attack and not something a trusted service will require.  Of course, it's important to keep your computer up to date. Microsoft releases security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, known as Patch Tuesday, and you can enable automatic updates on your machine to ensure you get fixes as soon as they're available. If you want to take additional steps to prevent ClickFix attacks on Windows, you can disable the Windows Run box to prevent unauthorized access to commands.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave. That, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes. As it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary. \nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Fraudsters prey on people's fear, confusion, and desire to protect their money, which may lead targets to hand over login credentials, make irreversible wire transfers, or provide other sensitive information without stopping to question their actions. Android users in the U.S. will soon have extra protection against scams targeting their financial apps, preventing threat actors impersonating bank representatives from accessing data on their devices. Google's in-call scam protection is designed to prevent users from sharing their screens with threat actors and help them avoid revealing their banking information. How Android in-call protection worksAndroid's scam protection kicks in if you are on a phone call with a number not saved in your contacts and attempt to open a participating financial app. You'll get a pop-up warning that the call is likely a scam with a reminder not to make payments or share personal information and a button to end the call (and stop screen sharing). There's also a 30-second delay on further action on your device, which Google says is designed to disrupt any sense of urgency. \nNote that financial institutions must opt into in this feature—at this time, Google has specifically named Cash App and JPMorganChase as partners, though it indicates expansion to other popular fintechs and banks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle initially rolled out in-call protections for banking apps to UK users earlier this year as part of a larger package of security features announced ahead of Google I/O. That launch also included real-time scam detection alerts for calls and texts, improved theft protection via remote lock and identity check, key verifier for Google Messages, and device-level Advanced Protection (in addition to account-level settings). Alongside the US pilot, in-call scam protections will now cover most major banks in the UK as well as financial apps in Brazil and India. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

An RC, as the name implies, is the version of a software update Apple intends to release to the general public. Before it rolls out, though, Apple sends the update out to beta testers to see if there are any bugs or glitches that need addressing. If not, these are the updates that will hit your Apple devices sometime this month. That includes watchOS 26.2, Apple's latest OS for its line of smartwatches. While there aren't nearly as many new features and changes in this update as there were in watchOS 26 proper, there are still some key things to highlight in this RC. In fact, as noted by 9to5Mac, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  \nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. Going forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.Music app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 RC that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. When does watchOS 26.2 come out?Apple doesn't have a set date for watchOS 26.2, or iOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2 for that matter. However, now that the RCs are out, these updates are likely coming soon. As long as there aren't any glaring bugs or glitches in these RCs, Apple will likely ship the updates sometime this month.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

For example, threat actors are generating real Apple support tickets to phish two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and gain access to iCloud accounts. The scheme, detailed on Medium by a security researcher and software product manager Eric Moret, shows how social engineering tactics can sow just enough fear and confusion to trick even those who know the red flags. (The money transfer scam that conned a financial advice columnist out of $50,000 is another example.) How scammers are exploiting Apple's support systemThe Apple support scam started with a text message from Apple containing a 2FA code, followed by verification notifications across devices, indicating that someone was trying to log into Moret's account. He then received an automated call from Apple with another 2FA code. The text was delivered from a five-digit short code, and the call from a toll-free number, both of which are used by legitimate businesses and not necessarily red flags of a scam.\nThe next call, however, came from an Atlanta-based 404 phone number. The caller claimed to be from Apple Support, stated that Moret's account was under attack, and assured him that they were opening up a support ticket. During a follow-up call lasting 25 minutes, Moret received a real Apple Support case confirmation via email (it turns out anyone can create an Apple support ticket in someone else's name) and was directed to reset his iCloud password. He was then sent a link via text—from the 404 number this time—to close the ticket. After clicking through, Moret was directed to a phishing website that spoofed a real Apple page (the URL was appeal-apple[dot]com), where he was prompted to enter a 6-digit 2FA code he'd just received via text. An email to his inbox then alerted him that an unknown Mac mini had been used to sign into his iCloud account, which the rep on the phone told him was \"expected as part of the security process\" and \"standard procedure.\" Moret then immediately reset his iCloud password again to kick the unauthorized device off.  It may be easy in hindsight to see the signs: the unsolicited call about an urgent security issue, the 404 number, the phishing link that isn't a real Apple subdomain, the request for an authentication code. But the Apple support ticket—with a real case number and official emails from apple.com domains—lent just enough credibility, and the multiple 2FA notifications just enough urgency, to work.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's the problem with social engineering. It manipulates emotions and instincts that are stronger than logic and reason, leading to actions that are not in our interest. How to stay safe As always, you should be wary of anyone who calls, texts, or emails you about a security or account issue, even if you have received real security alerts or they have a legitimate case number. Don't click links, enter credentials, or provide codes when prompted by these unsolicited callers. Don't accept reassurance from anyone on the phone, no matter how calm and confident they sound. If you are concerned, you should reach out directly using trusted contact information or open support tickets yourself. Always check URLs and subdomains carefully, as hackers can play tricks to make them look legit. Also, know that simply having 2FA enabled isn't enough to keep your accounts secure. Some forms are (obviously) easily phished, so if possible, you should use a multi-factor authentication method like a hardware key or WebAuthn credentials (biometrics and passkeys) rather than codes. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's the hard part.You could look up the documentation for the application or explore the menu bar—but if you're on a Mac, you could also just install KeyClu. This free application shows an overlay with all the keyboard shortcuts for the currently open Mac application, which is very useful for anyone trying to become a more keyboard-savvy computer user.To get started, install the application. Then, you'll need to choose a trigger key (basically one of the modifier keys on your keyboard). By default, you will tap the key twice and hold on the second tap to trigger the overlay, but you can optionally set the application to simply press and hold the key if you prefer. I opted to press and hold Command.\nAfter that, you'll be asked to enable permissions so KeyClu can access the keyboard shortcuts for your applications. Then you can start using the application. I tend to ignore the application until I wonder whether a keyboard shortcut for a particular function exists. I trigger the application, look through the list of keyboard shortcuts, and see what's available. When I let go of the trigger key, the window disappears.This default floating window is useful, but you might want a window listing shortcuts to stay open even when you let go of the trigger. That's where the persistent panel comes in. This window, which you can trigger using the menu bar, stays open and always shows a list of keyboard shortcuts for the currently active application. You can add a separate keyboard shortcut for this window in the settings, if you like.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf you dig around in KeyClu's settings, you can configure the layout of both the pop-up and persistent panels, changing the size of the windows, how many columns shortcuts are sorted into, and which display the panels show up on.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's a simple piece of software, but it's completely free and can help you get better at using your computer.

I started with a basic bidet added onto a standard toilet, but I always knew the time would come when I would make a big upgrade. That time was this Black Friday when I pulled the trigger on the Loniko Smart Toilet, and I'm so glad I did. It's $444.99 (originally $549.99) after using the additional $30 on-page coupon, and it's worth every penny.\nMy first experience with the Loniko Smart Toilet was over Thanksgiving, which I spent at my parents house; they were very excited for my brothers and me to try their new splurge in their guest bathroom: the toilet. The lid opened when I walked into the bathroom, welcoming me to sit on its heated seat. As I said, I've been using bidets in my home for years, but never one like the Loniko. The toilet comes with a remote you can prop on your wall for easy access. You can control the bidet's stream and direction, turn on the dryer, which was surprisingly effective and gentle, and do all the things the toilet does automatically, like opening and closing the lid, flushing, etc. After realizing that most decent bidets cost upwards of $300, I decided to snatch this toilet when it went on sale during Black Friday.Being able to control the temperature of the water in the stream is a huge deal for me, especially in the winter when the water in my home is extremely cold. Cleaning the toilet is also pretty easy. It has a skirted design, so there are no nooks and crannies near the base where dirt can get trapped. The toilet also automatically cleans itself after each flush. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep in mind you'll need an outlet close by to enable all its fancy features. You can also choose to get a tankless model, which results in quieter flushes, saves water and energy, and looks more modern, but it's harder to install (I went with the regular tank toilet and it flushes quietly enough for me).\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

We are so inundated with spam calls these days that refusing to answer incoming calls en masse isn't actually a bad strategy. When that call could be someone trying to break into your bank account, or alerting you to fraudulent credit card charges that never happened, perhaps it's best to just wait for friends and family to text instead. But let's say the call is from you to someone you know and trust, and let's assume they see it's you who's calling. Even though they know the call isn't spam, there are still plenty of reasons someone won't pick up the phone—including, of course, because they don't actually want to talk right now. But if you really need to get a hold of someone and don't want meetings, commutes, or the lack of desire for a phone call to get in the way, Google is currently working on a solution you can try right now. The new feature, named \"Call Reason,\" is designed to separate important phone calls from the rest. When you start dialing a number, Google will give you the option to mark the call as urgent. If you choose to do so, the person you're calling will see a pop-up reading \"It's urgent!\" on the call screen. Hopefully, that pop-up will encourage them to answer; however, I imagine they'll stop picking up if you start using it too often. \nThat said, not everyone ignores calls on purpose. If you aren't by your phone when it goes off, or if it's on silent in your pocket or bag, you obviously won't catch the urgent tag on the call screen. In that case, Android adds the urgent tag to the missed call in their recipient's call history. As long as the person you're trying to reach checks out their missed calls, they should see that this one was marked urgent—though if it's a real emergency, they might've received extra calls and messages from you in the interim anyway. It seems Google has been working on this feature for some time. Android Authority previously spotted something called Expressive Calling in the Phone app's APK, which would let the caller add animations and emojis to calls. In addition to that functionality, however, was the ability to flag the reason for a call when dialing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to try Call Reason Google is still testing the Call Reason feature, but anyone using the current version of the Google Phone app will be able to try it out. (It's still rolling out, though, so you may not see it yet.) The feature also only works with saved contacts, and when calling Android users who have Google's Phone app set as the primary calling app.  When Call Reason does show up on your phone, you'll see it appear after placing your call. The UI says \"Mark call as urgent?,\" with a prompt letting you know that the call will ring through and show the call is urgent. Tap \"Notify,\" and you're set. Once the recipient sees the call, they'll see the \"Incoming call\" banner replaced by an animated \"It's urgent!\" pop-up. It's a fun design, but perhaps a bit too fun, when you're likely using this in important situations.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nAlongside Call Reason, Google announced a number of new features for Android 16. There are now improved parental controls locked behind a PIN of the parents' choosing; new UI customization options, like expanded dark mode support and new custom shapes for home screen icons; and the continued roll out of Google's AI notification summaries, which Lifehacker writer David Nield hasn't found all that useful yet.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

(It's also in stock at Walmart.) The deal includes the new console with the new Mario Kart for the same price as the standalone console. You can get this one for $449 (down from $499)—the lowest price it has reached yet, according to price-tracking tools. (Note that you can only see the price once you've signed in and it's in your cart, as Nintendo restricts retailers from promoting anything below the \"minimum advertised price\" of $499.) With Christmas on the way, this deal is likely to sell out fast again, so I'd advise ordering it sooner rather than later if you're considering it.\nThis bundle deal is great, and likely the best one you'll see for quite some time, judging by Nintendo's previous deals. To put it into perspective, the OLED edition of the original Nintendo Switch is $400 right now, meaning you can get the new Switch 2 with Mario Kart for $50 more. The new console is also an upgrade in every way, according to Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt's Nintendo Switch 2 review. The ergonomics and design have improved, making it much better to hold and look at. The battery life has also improved, now with about 180 minutes of handheld playtime before the juice runs out.A big plus is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, meaning you can play your old Switch games. Some Switch games have the ability to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition by buying that game's upgrade pack. This is especially worth it for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which will look better on the Switch 2.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere aren't a lot of Switch 2 games out at the moment, but there are some classic Nintendo games to keep you busy until the library expands, like Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The consequences are high: With stolen credentials, scammers can gain full control of your accounts and your money. According to the FBI advisory, criminals will quickly wire funds from your bank to cryptocurrency wallets, making the money nearly impossible to trace and recover, and lock you out of your account in the process. Here's how account takeover scams work—and how to avoid becoming a victim. \nAccount takeover scams may impersonate your bankMost account takeover scams use social engineering: a series of tactics designed to manipulate you into giving up personal information, downloading malware, or paying money to bad actors. Scammers impersonate financial institution employees as well as customer support and technical support staff and reach out to targets via text, call, or email to say that their account has been compromised in some way.They may tell you that there have been fraudulent charges on your account and send you a link to report the fraud—but this is actually a phishing site designed to harvest your login credentials. They may ask directly for your username, password, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) code over the phone. In some cases, they may even claim that your information was used to buy firearms and pass you off to a second scammer impersonating law enforcement. They're counting on you to feel fear and confusion and act quickly to \"resolve\" the issue by handing over your information. The FBI has also identified a version of account takeover using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, in which scammers buy ads that appear to be for legitimate businesses but actually allow them to place malicious links to spoofed bank websites higher in search results. How to avoid falling for account takeover scamsWhile being targeted for an account takeover may be unavoidable, there are a few red flags that can help you identify the fraud before it goes south. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you should always be wary of calls, texts, emails, and other communication (such as social media messages) from someone claiming to be from your bank or creditor, especially if they ask for personal information like your username, password, or time-based one-time password (TOTP). Reputable institutions will not contact you to request your credentials or other sensitive data—so these are almost certainly phishing attempts. You should also be wary of trusting websites that look like they belong to your financial institution, especially if you click to them from a browser search. Cybercriminals can easily build convincing (but spoofed) websites and place the malicious links at the top of search results. Bookmark the trusted link rather than going through a search engine, or use the verified app on your mobile device. Always avoid clicking directly from unsolicited communication, and check URLs and email addresses carefully, as scammers can also use homographs to hide malicious links.  Finally, protect your personal information. Use complex, unique passwords stored securely (such as in a password manager), enable a stronger form of MFA (and never give away codes), and limit what you share online. Scammers may use what you've posted—like your date of birth, pet's name, or information about family members—to get past your security questions, guess your password, or make an impersonation attempt sound more convincing.

    "body": "\n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        December 2, 2025\n    \n            Credit: Pranay Parab\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        When I switched to a Mac about a decade ago, I immediately fell in love with my MacBook's menu bar, and especially the various icons in its top-right corner. I've always enjoyed keeping useful menu bar apps there, such as clipboard managers, app launchers, or apps that update other apps. But unfortunately, if you've installed more than a few third-party apps on your MacBook, your menu bar might be pretty cluttered. It's nothing a quick clean-up can't fix, though, and now macOS ships with a few ways to help fix your messy menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nJust as you'd remove unwanted items from your desk, you should periodically declutter the menu bar by removing apps that don't need to be there. This doesn't uninstall those apps, but it does free up some space in your menu bar. I do this for menu bar icons I never end up clicking. macOS 26 Tahoe has an easy way to remove apps from the menu bar. Follow these steps to do it:Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen.Go to System Settings > Menu Bar.In the right pane, navigate to the section called Allow in the Menu Bar.You'll see a list of apps that have a menu bar icon. You can uncheck any app you want to remove.Some apps also offer a way to remove their icons from the menu bar. Try checking your apps' settings to see if they let you remove their menu bar icons.\nNote that removing a menu bar icon for an app can sometimes cause the app to become \"headless,\" which means that it'll be running in the background but its icon won't show up in either the menu bar or the dock. This is fine for apps that you only need to configure once, but it can become a problem if you want to use the app regularly. In such cases, you can use a Spotlight search (Cmd + Space, or the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar) or alternatives such as Alfred or Raycast to search for the app's name and open it.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm sure you've noticed that the menu bar has more than just app icons. It's also home to the clock, wifi, volume controls, and more. You can easily add or remove these controls from the menu bar, as long as you're running macOS Tahoe. Here's how:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGo to System Settings > Menu Bar.Head over to the Menu Bar Controls section.Uncheck any control you want to remove from the menu bar.You cannot entirely remove the clock from the menu bar, but you can click Clock Options… and switch to Analog to make its icon a lot smaller.Drag and drop icons to rearrange the menu bar\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou also have the option of dragging and dropping your app icons around the menu bar, or using drag-and-drop to remove them from the menu bar. Just hold the Command key and drag any menu bar icon to a different position within the menu bar to rearrange it. To remove icons from the menu bar using drag-and-drop, hold Command and drag-and-drop them outside the menu bar.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nTo tame the chaos at the top of your Mac's screen, I strongly recommend using a menu bar manager app. These apps will automatically show or hide menu bar icons based on triggers (eg: the battery icon will only show up when your MacBook's charge is below 25%), or add a second row of icons that's visible only when you click the menu bar. You'll need to try a couple of menu bar managers to decide which one works best for you.

That isn't always the case with Apple, however. The company has a long history of removing functions from one generation of devices to the next, whether that's removing the disc drive from its MacBooks back in 2012, or taking away the iPhone's Home button in 2017. Some of these changes are good, some are controversial, while others are undone altogether: MagSafe and HDMI both found their way back to MacBooks after all.It's not often I hear about Apple removing software features from one generation of product to the next, however. So, imagine my surprise when I saw a number of headlines this morning asserting that the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple's latest and greatest flagship, is missing a feature found in the last five generations of Pro iPhones—and nobody noticed for nearly three months. Night mode is missing from Portrait mode on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The short answer? We have no idea. This was not something Apple announced publicly, of course. In fact, Macworld spotted the change in an Apple support doc: If you scroll down to the section where it says \"On supported models, you can take Night mode photos with Portrait mode,\" and click the hyperlink on \"On supported models,\" you'll pull up a list of iPhones that, mysteriously, doesn't include the 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max. The list includes:\niPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro Max For the uninitiated, Night mode and Portrait mode are technically two distinct features. Portrait mode was released first, all the way back on the iPhone 7 Plus, which utilized the dual-camera system to add a bokeh effect to shots of people. Those early shots were hit or miss, and were often no replacement for a true DSLR, but as Apple's tech and cameras have improved, so has Portrait mode. Part of the improvement was the introduction of Night mode. This feature, which Apple was a bit late to the game on, allowed you to take brighter images in low-light environments by lengthening the time the shutter stays engaged. Older iPhones without the feature would take images that were hard to see without the flash engaged, but Night mode could pull in details as long as there was just enough light present in the scene. Since the iPhone 12 Pro, Portrait mode came with the option of Night mode, as well. If you're trying to take a portrait shot in a dark environment, Night mode kicks in and gives the image a chance to turn out brighter and more detailed. But now, it seems, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max do not have this option. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, these new iPhones still have Night mode: Per that previously mentioned support page, you can take brighter shots at night when taking standard photos, selfies, and time-lapse videos. It just seems Apple decided to remove the feature for Portrait mode shots on its latest Pros.Of course, this news started breaking on Dec. 3, nearly three months after the 17 Pros launched. If it took this long for someone to notice a missing feature, was it really all that important to begin with? I don't have a 17 Pro, so I really can't say, but I also can't say I take many Portrait mode shots in dark environments. I've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this story if I hear back. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Samsung announced One UI 8.5 on Monday, Dec. 8, the latest update for Galaxy devices. At present, this new update is only out in beta, but select Galaxy users can try it out right now. Here's what's new, according to Samsung. With One UI 8.5, Quick Share can automatically identify people in photos. While that sounds a bit creepy, the idea is to proactively offer sharing recommendations to the people who are featured in any given photo. Say you hit Quick Share on a family photo you took over the weekend. Rather than manually enter all of the contacts you'd like to share that image with, the feature can identify each, and automatically suggest sending the image to those contacts. It should speed up sharing pictures with groups of people after you take them, but, again, a little unsettling. Photo Assist updates\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nThe Gallery app's Photo Assist feature is getting some upgrades in One UI 8.5. As of this version, Photo Assist now supports \"uninterrupted editing.\" That means you can make your AI-generated edits without needing to save in between each change. Previously, each edit would produce an entirely new image, so this makes the feature a bit more like a traditional photo editor. In addition, you'll be able to view all of the AI images you made in your edit history, and choose the one you like the most. \nSide note: Samsung says Photo Assist's Generate Edit feature requires an internet connection as well as a Samsung Account login. The feature also places a watermark on the image, so other people will know it was manipulated or generated with AI.   Audio Broadcast\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nOne UI 8.5 now supports sharing audio to other devices via Auracast, following Google's wider support for the standard back in September. If you have any LE Audio-supported devices, like headphones or speakers, you can use Audio Broadcast to share media from your Galaxy. This isn't limited to music, podcasts, or audio from videos, either, as Samsung says you can also broadcast your Galaxy's microphone to LE Audio devices, too.  This feature is limited to Galaxy S25 devices, even after One UI 8.5 rolls out to other Galaxy phones. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nIf you have a number of Samsung Galaxy devices, you might find Storage Share useful. This One UI 8.5 feature lets you manage your files across other devices, including tablets, PCs and even TVs, in the My Files app on your smartphone.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Security ControlsSamsung is also expanding One UI's security features with this latest beta. The company is rolling out updates to Theft Protection with One UI 8.5, an existing feature that can lock your device if it's lost or stolen. That way, whoever picks it up won't have access to your data, or won't be able to erase the device and set it up as their own. In that same vein, Samsung is also launching Failed Authentication Lock, which locks the display after too many failed verification attempts. If a thief tries too many PIN combinations, or the fingerprint scanner fails too many times, your screen will lock them out.  How to try the beta on your GalaxyWhile you can apply for the beta program today, first, consider the risks. Like all beta software, this version of One UI is currently in testing, which means there may be bugs and glitches that could interrupt your experience using your smartphone. If you understand these risks (and back up all important information ahead of time), here's what you need to know. First, this beta is only open for Galaxy S25 users in the U.S., Germany, India, Korea, Poland, and the UK. If you have an S24 or older, you'll need to wait for Samsung to roll out the One UI 8.5 beta more widely, or for the full release down the line. Next, you'll need to apply to join the beta from the Samsung Members app. If you don't have the app yet, download it from the Play Store, then follow the instructions to enroll in the beta.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It brings one of my favorite Mac apps to Microsoft's operating system. In fact, I've enjoyed using Raycast for Windows so much, I can't see myself going back to the non-Raycast life. This app is free to download and use, though there is an optional paid subscription for those who want certain additional features. What is Raycast?\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nAt its heart, Raycast is an app that lets you search for apps and files stored in your computer. It stays hidden until you press its keyboard shortcut (Alt-Space on Windows). Once you do, Raycast appears as a floating search bar on the desktop. You can type anything you want to locate in the search bar, and Raycast forages through your computer to find it. I primarily use it as an app launcher since I have way too many apps on my Mac (and PC). Raycast helps me find the right app quickly and open it.That's just the surface layer of Raycast, though. You can use Raycast to search for files on your computer, retrieve items you've copied to the clipboard, send queries to ChatGPT (or other AI tools), convert currencies and units, and much more. All of these features are available under the same simple floating search bar.\nSet up keyboard shortcuts in Raycast\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nRaycast is designed for people who love keyboard shortcuts. You can totally use it without them, but you'll enjoy it a lot more if you set up a few shortcuts of your own. As an example, if you open Raycast and press Tab, it switches to AI mode, and you can directly send your questions and requests to ChatGPT from Raycast.Whenever you search for anything in Raycast, you'll probably see a button called Record hotkey next to the results. This is your cue to set up a keyboard shortcut for that action, and doing so will allow you to get to it faster. You can also go to Raycast settings to find commonly used actions and record your preferred keyboard shortcuts for all of them.Note that the Raycast app is still in beta on Windows, and during this trial period, you can use these AI features for free. Expect that to change, though, once it's out of beta. If you want to keep using these features, the pro tier costs $8 per month for most AI models, but certain advanced AI models are only available in the $16 per month subscription tier.What I use Raycast for on Windows\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI use Raycast for a lot more than just launching apps on Windows. As someone who lives outside the US, converting units and currencies is a big part of my work day. Raycast's workflow is quite seamless for this task. You can just type \"$499\" or any other number after the dollar sign, and Raycast automatically converts it to your local currency. You can also type something like \"EUR499 to USD\" and it'll convert euros to the US dollar. I really like the fact that you don't even have to press the Enter/Return key to see the converted currency. The moment you type a currency number, the result shows up without any further prompts.You can also try other unit conversions with Raycast, eg: \"100kg to lbs,\" \"800ml to fl oz,\" \"44 sqm to sqft,\" etc. This helps me a lot when I'm ordering things from international websites that don't always have dimensions, weight, or pricing available in units I'm used to.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBeyond this, I like using Raycast to store and view clipboard history. You can search for Clipboard in Raycast to access items you've copied, and the app even categorizes these items for you. You can search just for links, images, files, or email address you've copied, which makes it easy to quickly find specific items from your clipboard history.Raycast also supports many other things such as window management, emptying the recycle bin, restarting your computer, locking your PC, bookmarking links and opening them in specific browsers, and text snippets—which let you quickly create or copy bits of text or code. You can open Raycast, and press Ctrl-, (comma) to open its settings and explore all its features.The limitations of Raycast for Windows\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nRaycast only recently launched on Windows, which means there are a few things still missing from the macOS version. This includes the AI Chat feature (more advanced than the quick AI search available now), focus timers, the built-in notes feature, and support for more extensions. Many of its extensions were originally built only for macOS, so it's going to take some time to bring them to Windows. The feature that I miss the most is the ability to sync your snippets, notes, chats, and other data across devices. This feature is yet to come to the Windows app, and I hope the developers change that soon.Raycast is available on the Mac, iPhone, and now, Windows.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.</p>\n<p>If you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/422610/oura-ring-neurable-apple-airpods-brain-health\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>stop at headphones</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/what-is-wearable-neurotech-and-why-might-we-need-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>they aren’t the only company</u></a> making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. </p><h2 id=\"what-are-brain-wearables-in-theory\">What are brain wearables in theory?</h2><p>The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">electroencephalography</a> (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.</p><p>For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your <em>work</em>-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.</p><p>The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-science-of-brain-wearables-hold-up\">How does the science of brain wearables hold up?</h2><p>Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.neurotechlaw.com/jose-m-munoz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">José M. Muñoz</a>, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"</p><p>The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.</p><p>\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"</p><p>In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.</p><p><a href=\"https://annunavani.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dr. Annu Navani</a> offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Rather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-really-reading-your-mind-here\">Who is really reading your mind here?</h2><p>Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? </p><p>\"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says <a href=\"https://www.starkashman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Star Kashman</u></a>, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"</p><p>The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.</p><p>Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/technology/personaltech/meta-smart-glasses-mark-zuckerberg.html#:~:text=But%20our%2030%2Dminute%20test,Creative%20Strategies%2C%20a%20research%20firm.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Meta's push</a> for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. </p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>So, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. </p><p>I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.</p><p>For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.</p><p>Until then, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-fitness-trackers\" target=\"_blank\">your regular fitness tracker</a> measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBE4ASBWE2SZPMN349CSQ/image.fill.size_150x150.v1704303046.png\" alt=\"Meredith Dietz\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Meredith Dietz</p>\n                                    <p>Senior Staff Writer</p>\n                                <div>\n                                            <p>Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.</p>\n                                    </div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/meredithdietz\">Read Meredith's full bio</a></p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Meredith</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-run-coach-marathon-training-plans\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K779KY2A80E6ZBAA5VYE3K2K/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1760107820.png\" alt=\"Garmin watch training plan\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fitness-watches-under-200-dollars-october-prime-day-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K72SPXH2RS93BW9RXQGGN8DA/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759958378.png\" alt=\"three fitness watches in an illustrated shipping box\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>",

/><p>When you log into the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton app</a>, you probably get down to the business of finding a class, whether that means searching through the absurdly large library of single classes, turning to your <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">Stack</a>, or following the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-new-personalized-plan-impressions\" target=\"_blank\">personalized plan</a> curated for you by the app's AI. All of that is fine and well—though generally, following a Stack or personalized plan is better, since it reduces the time you spend deliberating and dilly-dallying and gives you a clear goal for the workout—but you have another option. In fact, depending on your goals, you have another potentially <em>superior</em> option in the form of a Peloton Program.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-peloton-program\">What is a Peloton Program?</h2><p>Program is the term Peloton uses for longer-term, guided training routines that are tailored to a specific goal. They can range from a few days long to weeks long, but the idea is that you'll finish the program and be more prepared to do whatever it was you were training for. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>When you log into the app on your mobile device or Peloton equipment, you'll see your personalized plan first, followed by a subheading that says <strong>Your Programs</strong>. There, any Programs you're currently participating in will be ready to go. You can just tap it to keep moving through it with whatever class or exercise is next up. To access Programs and see everything available, tap <strong>Classes</strong> in the bottom row of the mobile app, then <strong>Programs</strong> up at the top. (It's to the right of <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Gym</strong>, and <strong>Collections</strong>.)</p><p>Each program is designed by an instructor (or, sometimes, more than one instructor) and when you tap on it, you'll see information on how many classes are in it, how many days or weeks it lasts, and how long the classes are. You'll also see a summary of the Program and what it's designed for, as well as notes on which equipment, if any, is necessary for the classes. You can even see a week-by-week breakdown of what classes to expect. </p><p>These are self-paced, so you can take the classes or participate whenever you want, but you should try to do them in the timeframe laid out by the instructor. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-can-you-use-programs-for\">What can you use Programs for?</h2><p>This is the fun part. There are so many Programs and some of them are almost too specific to believe—but that's why they're useful. There's probably one in there that aligns with exactly what you're trying to do, whatever it is. A selection of titles:</p><ul><li><p>Strength for Soccer (one week, seven classes)</p></li><li><p>The Power of Sleep (two weeks, 15 classes)</p></li><li><p>Strength for Cyclists (one week, six classes)</p></li><li><p>Floor Bootcamp (four weeks, 24 classes)</p></li><li><p>Road to Half Marathon (10 weeks, 40 classes)</p></li><li><p>Strength for Tennis & Pickleball (one week, eight classes)</p></li><li><p>Strength for Skiers (one week, 11 classes)</p></li><li><p>You Can Run Outdoors (eight weeks, 16 classes)</p></li><li><p>Set the Barre (four weeks, 13 classes)</p></li><li><p>Path to Inversion (two weeks, 12 classes)</p></li></ul><p>There is \"density training,\" training for people who golf, and training for anyone looking to pull off a yoga inversion. Again, these are specific goals, but with strength, meditation, and other classes geared toward them, you can take a more well-rounded approach to meeting them. Programs are also classified as beginner, intermediate, or advanced, so you don't end up in over your head or bored. </p><p>One thing I like about them—besides that they help you create a goal-based workout plan and are so tailored to specific achievements—is that participating in them earns you extra points <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/club-peloton-ranking-system\" target=\"_blank\">toward your Club Peloton rank</a>. By moving up in Club Peloton, you can unlock discounts and early access to other classes, providing even more variety (and some smugness, if you're like me). </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

/><p>Doing things the old-fashioned way and <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">hand-writing your notes</a> is better for retaining what you’ve learned, but it definitely has drawbacks that can make typing notes more appealing. Hand-written notes aren’t searchable on your phone or laptop, for example, and unlike your phone, your notebook probably won’t always be with you for a quick study session on the bus or train. That’s why you should take advantage of both methods: once you’ve written them out, you should digitize your notes in some fashion to make studying easier, blending the old style with the new. Here are the best ways to do so.</p><h2 id=\"the-easiest-way-to-digitize-your-notes-a-camera\">The easiest way to digitize your notes: A camera</h2><p>The most straightforward way to digitize your notes is by taking a picture of them and uploading it to your Google Drive or straight to your computer. You can name and file the images however you want, and though they won’t be easily searchable, they will be legible to you. Though this is <em>super </em>basic, it’s on the list because there’s one major advantage here: After uploading the image of your paper, you can stick it at the top of a document and use it as a guide to further revise your notes in the space for typing below. Manual revision (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">especially when done right after class</a>) is extremely beneficial to understanding and retention, so if you’re trying to grasp the content at hand, it might be better to just type and revise it all yourself than to, say, let an app or gadget do the work for you. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>That said, phones are getting smarter, and the built-in photos app on iPhone allows you to search for specific words within photos. For example, if you know you have a page of notes about the respiratory system saved as a photo, you should be able to search \"respiratory system\" or \"lungs\" or \"alveoli\" and it will search all your photos for those phrases. Google Photos has something similar.</p><p>On that note, let’s talk apps and gadgets. (No judgment.)</p><h2 id=\"use-an-app-to-digitize-your-notes\">Use an app to digitize your notes</h2><p>The most popular app for digitizing notes is Evernote, which advertises itself as a “pocket scanner” on your phone. You use an in-app camera to scan the document and, if your notes are “clearly written,” they’ll become editable and searchable. I tested this one out and didn't love it, but it's still the most popular and worth your time to consider. (You can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/evernote-notes-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">read my full review of Evernote here</a>.)</p><p>For what it's worth, in a head-to-head notes app battle, I tend to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/evernote-vs-notion-best-note-taking-app\" target=\"_blank\">favor Notion over Evernote</a>, but in this instance, that's not true because Notion doesn't allow for the scanning of handwritten notes. </p><p>If you want to hand-write <em>into </em>an app, try <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Microsoft OneNote</a>, which is free and easily converts what you write with your finger or stylus into searchable, editable text and makes it available across all your devices with Microsoft’s tools installed.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"use-a-smart-notebook-to-digitize-your-notes\">Use a smart notebook to digitize your notes</h2><p>To make the writing-to-digital process super easy, try a tool designed for the purpose: A smart notebook. You have a few options when it comes to devices that turn your writing into easily accessible notes. The most popular is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/76P54?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Rocketbook&short_url=76P54&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868&event_label=Rocketbook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Rocketbook</a> ($22–$40), which comes in a few different sizes and styles and is simple to use. You write on the pages with the pen that comes with it, scan the page with the associated app, and then wipe the page clean to start again, as whatever was already on it is syncing to your device. I picked one up for myself when I started grad school and got one for my boyfriend when he went back to school, too. We both found it easy to use, functional, and simple to transport. </p><p>While those are more like traditional paper and pen, you also have the option of a smart notebook that is more like a tablet. There are a number of these on the market, but Lifehacker's Joel Cunningham spent a year testing eight of them and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-digital-notebooks-you-can-buy-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">comprised this list of the best ones</a>. With e-ink notebooks tablets aimed at those who need an AI assist, those who require a lot of writing space, or those who also want to read textbooks and other materials on it, you'll find one that aligns with your own needs. Just be warned that with prices between $285 and $690, they're quite a bit pricier than the Rocketbook. Still, a resource that can help you through school and beyond is always a good investment. </p><p>For what it's worth, the best-performing one of the bunch is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z6Dbyj?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Boox%20Note%20Air%204C%2010.3-Inch%20Digital%20Notebook&short_url=z6Dbyj&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868&event_label=Boox%20Note%20Air%204C%2010.3-Inch%20Digital%20Notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Boox Note Air 4C 10.3-Inch Digital Notebook</a> ($530) for a few reasons. Its 10.3\" screen is big enough to write on, but not so big that it makes it hard to carry this thing around. The ease of writing with the stylus is notable, <a href=\"https://apollo-preview.lifehacker.com/tech/onyx-boox-note-air-4c-e-reader-review\" target=\"_blank\">according to Joel's review</a>, as is the varied functionality of its native note-taking app, which helps you not only write your notes, but organize them. </p><h2 id=\"make-a-mind-map-instead\">Make a mind map instead</h2><p>Revising your notes and turning them into readable, portable, and digital versions is smart no matter how you do it and you'll probably want to keep them, well, looking like notes. But there's value in making a mind map, too. Part of your revision process can be using an <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">app like Xmind </a>to create a visual mind map that shows the connections between the concepts, ideas, and facts in your notes. Studying with a mind map is helpful, especially for visual learners, because it helps you think critically about how everything you're going over works together, both while you're creating and reviewing the map. When you use an app to do it, your maps stay on your phone, so you still have the ease of studying whenever you can find time. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

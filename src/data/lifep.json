On the one hand, these features have the potential to make shopping more convenient—on the other hand, maybe lowering friction isn't the best idea when it comes to spending money. Beyond selling you on convenience, these features all share something else in common—helping businesses up their clickthrough rates.It starts with AI Mode and Gemini, which can now access all the same information as Google Search's shopping tab. That means you'll start to see product cards alongside your AI answers, which you can click on for a bunch of shopping links, or hit a checkmark to compare the selected products. They won't show up on every question, but on about half of the prompts I tried, I got the option to spend money right away.Then, if you're still not sure you want to buy yet, now you can have Google's AI robocall local businesses for you to check on product availability and pricing, as well as any deals or bundles you might not know about. There are a few caveats—businesses can opt out, and Google will avoid calling them at odd hours or too frequently—but the idea is that if you're on the fence, you can have an AI help you know which stores to go to.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFinally, when it comes time to actually purchase whatever you're shopping for, you can have Google's AI check out for you. This feature is an extension of the existing price tracking feature, and will add a \"Buy for me\" button to any price tracking notifications you get from certain participating stores, like Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, or certain Shopify merchants. You'll get a link to the product you'd be buying from your notification, and the price will be pulled from that, so the company says you won't have to worry about the AI getting the price wrong. Instead, it's just supposed to remove any hesitation you might feel from having to enter your shipping or payment details into a checkout form.I won't deny that, when holiday shopping, I usually won't turn down assistance. But a continued refrain I had while hearing about these new features was \"Why?\"Personally, I'm mortified at the idea of sending employees at local businesses robocalls to deal with. And if I'm researching products, while it might be helpful to be able to involve an AI so I could ask specific question, I think I'd still prefer full access to all the filters and hundreds of links available in Google Shopping. The big thing for me, though, is agentic checkout. While I'm actually willing to trust Google that it won't make mistakes (and you do get a reference ID to hand to support in case it does), I'm also not sure why I'd want to go right from getting a price drop notification to having an AI spend money for me. It doesn't take long to fill out a checkout form, and while Google Shopping is a useful price tracking tool, it's not the only one around. I'd probably want to comparison shop a bit more before committing, at which point I might as well fill out the checkout form myself. But if you think about these features from the perspective of a business, the \"why\" behind all of this suddenly becomes a lot clearer. Turning people browsing web listings into actual paying customers has been a problem for about as long as the internet has existed, and all of these features introduce new opportunities for impulse purchases at every step of the buying process, while also erasing the opportunity for users to get caught up on a larger selection of options.It's not a conspiracy. Google charges companies for sponsored slots and ads, and the more people that buy products using a Google service, the more companies will want to pay for those. And for what it's worth, Lifehacker makes money on affiliate links. I won't deny that companies needs money, and that people need to buy gifts.What this does do, however, is reduce the friction that might pop up in between having an idle thought to buy something, and opening your wallet. While it plays at being a research buddy, it takes control out of your hands, obfuscates sources and other options, and instead encourages you to spend your money as quickly as possible, while discouraging skepticism.As someone who writes reviews and best-of lists, I like to think that my readers are a bit more savvy than that. Convenience is great, but taking the extra few minutes it takes to find an actual human opinion from someone who's used the product, or to double check that the price Google is serving you is really your best option, could save you from hours of pain down the line.Like most AI tools, there's potential here. But as much as AI will try to convince you that it's just some neutral buddy, remember that there are business motivations behind everything the companies behind these chatbots do. Keeping your whole shopping search in the same ecosystem as a company that's main profit still comes from ads and e-commerce probably isn't the best way to get your information.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple brought RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging to the iPhone with iOS 18 last year, giving green-bubble users access to more features and functions. But what exactly is possible with RCS on the iPhone, and what is still exclusive to iMessage users? Are Android RCS users now fully integrated into chats in the iOS Messages app or not?I'll lay out exactly what you can do in RCS chats between iPhones and Android phones, and explain which features are still missing—and when you might be able to get them.  If you've got contacts on other mobile platforms, this should help you understand more about what the experience is like from their end.To use RCS, you must have a carrier that supports it (most now do). On an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging to enable it. In Google Messages on Android, tap your profile picture (top right), then choose Messages settings and RCS chats to turn on the feature.\nRCS on iOS and Android: what you can do Ever since iOS 18, RCS messaging has officially been supported in the iOS Messages app—specifically, via the RCS Universal Profile 2.4. This brings green bubble Android users closer to parity with iMessage users, though some features only work in one direction, and some features only work in one-to-one conversations and not group chats.One notable upgrade is support for high-resolution photos and videos, which should work seamlessly across all your RCS-enabled conversations, with no more issues around compression or transfer. Web links look better as well, because you'll get a proper preview shown on both Android and iOS, and you can share current locations too (though only as a static pin, not a live and updating one).\n    \n            \n            Web links now look much better between iOS and Android.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTyping indicators and read receipts are supported in both directions, assuming you've got them enabled on your devices. However, they don't work in group chats—RCS users on Android can now join group chats, but the experience can be buggy based on reports, and you lose the typing indicators and the read receipts.Emoji reactions are now supported, up to a point—but based on my testing, these only work from iPhone to Android. If you try and send an emoji reaction in the other direction, iPhone users will just get a separate text showing the emoji (it won't appear as a bubble on top of the original message).RCS on iOS and Android: what you can't do (yet)If you look at everything you can do in iMessage (with other iMessage users) and Google Messages (with other Android RCS users), you'll realize there's a long way to go when it comes to cross-platform support. For example, at the moment you can't unsend messages, or reply inline in a thread, either from Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android.You can edit messages, but only if you're an Android user messaging an iPhone user—and with the caveat that the iPhone user gets two texts (the original message and the edited message, which rather defeats the point). The ability to edit messages on an iPhone simply doesn't appear in an RCS conversation.\n    \n            \n            Message editing is something that doesn't quite work yet.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAnother missing feature is end-to-end encryption for your chats and files shared in them. Apple has promised that support for this in RCS conversations is on the way, though it hasn't shown up yet—not even in iOS 26. This should give you pause when it comes to sharing sensitive information in these chats.Full end-to-end encryption is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which Google is testing in beta and which Apple has yet to adopt. Once this next update finally makes its way to iPhones and Android devices, interoperability will be leveled up again—it should, in theory, bring with it full support for message editing, emoji reactions, and inline replies. Until then, it's something of a half-baked implementation, especially for group chats.\n            ",

Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.And then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Spotify is doing its best to fix at least one of those problems, by testing AI recaps for some of its audiobooks.It's the first new AI-powered feature in a while that I would actually use. In fact, I've played a few video games with similar features (not powered by AI, admittedly), and it's always such a value-add that it makes me pine for it in pretty much every other piece of media I engage with.Here's how Spotify's new feature works: First, you unfortunately do need to be using the Spotify app for iOS, so Android, web, or desktop listeners are out of luck, at least during this beta test. Then, you'll need to have listened to a supported English language audiobook for at least 15-20 minutes. After that, you'll see a Recap button at the top of the page that will quickly generate a one- to two-minute-long summary of what's happened in the book so far, which Spotify promises will be spoiler-free for future plot events. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nPreviously on [your book]Spotify's likening it to a \"previously on\" segment on a TV show, although it also says that, \"Recaps do not replicate narration or replace the original audiobook in any way,\" so don't expect to hear actual clips from the book, nor an AI voice trying to mimic the narrator. However, just as TV's \"previously on\" segments will change with new episodes, your AI Recap will be \"regularly updated to match your progress.\"As for any potential issues with the feature, the company says it is \"not using audiobook content for LLM training purposes or voice generation\" and that authors can opt out of having Recaps on their books. Still, there are a few caveats, including the fact that the Recap feature isn't free.On the plus side, it is included alongside the free audiobook hours you get with Spotify Premium, as well as any add-on hours you might buy. But otherwise, audiobooks on Spotify need to be bought on a per-book basis, so for users without Spotify Premium and with no audiobooks in their libraries (that's me), there's no way to try AI Recaps before you buy, which means it's maybe not a convincing reason to swap audiobook platforms just yet.Not all books will get RecapsSpotify's also not being upfront about which books have Recaps, so it could be a bit before you see the button pop up for you. So while I like the idea in theory, I'm probably not going to get to test it anytime soon. (I've reached out to Spotify to ask for a current list of books with Recaps enabled, and will update this article when I hear back.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCould Recaps include hallucinations?Another potential issue with these Recaps: hallucinations. Spotify didn't address accuracy at all in its announcement, which I'd like to think implies the company is feeling pretty confident it won't be an issue. But there is still a potential for an AI to misreport specific details of your story, or accidentally slip a spoiler in regardless of what Spotify claims. One would hope your memory would be jogged enough by a general outline to catch inconsistencies, but still, it might be worth keeping a few notes while you read, just in case.How to get AI summaries for any book (without using Spotify)If you aren't a Spotify audiobook listener or just haven't gotten to try the beta, I'll give you a cheat: You can already ask other AI chatbots for book summaries for free. So long as you remember where you left off, just head over to your AI of choice and ask for a summary up to that point. Here's one for the opening chapters of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt (via ChatGPT)\n                    \n    \nI won't deny that there's real convenience in having a summary feature baked directly into your app, especially one that doesn't require you to cross reference where you left off lest you, I don't know, spoil the Red Wedding for yourself or something. But if you're like me (not a Spotify audiobook customer), at least you're not out of options.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. But it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

They range from tedious to totally archaic, but there's a technique for everyone. One method I have come to enjoy aims to work by giving you more insight into how you spend your time—and helping you manage your day down to the minute. It’s called time blocking.What is time blocking?Time blocking is the act of arranging your schedule so every activity you need to do in a day is accounted for visually. Ideally, you’ll do this using a digital calendar tool like Google Calendar or iCal, but it's possible with a planner and some highlighters. Even if you’re writing it all down by hand on a piece of paper, consider the way a Google Calendar looks before you start. Each day is represented by a column split up into 15-minute increments, from midnight until 11:59 p.m. When you add a meeting or appointment into the calendar, a box appears and fills up the space representing how much time the event will take out of your day.With time blocking, your goal is to fill the entire column with boxes, leaving no blank space. Even your rest periods should be marked as such (and yes, you need rest periods to be your most productive, so don't skip those). No activity—from having breakfast to running errands to calling your mom—is too small to add to the list. Then, you get to classify everything with a pretty color (when it comes to time management, you have to find your own fun).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow to create a time blocking scheduleStart by making a list of everything you’re going to do tomorrow. For instance, you might wake up, check the news, shower, make coffee, commute to work, grab breakfast, answer emails, attend a meeting, get lunch with an old friend, work on a project, commute home, take the kids to a baseball game, pick up dinner, eat that dinner, watch your favorite show, get ready for bed, lie awake thinking about climate change, and actually sleep. Get  granular here. At first blush, you might think your to-do list on a given day is just something like \"hit deadlines at work\" and \"make a doctor's appointment,\" but think of everything else in there, like packing your lunch, driving to the locations, stopping for gas, etc. Once you’ve written out the exhaustive list of your day’s tasks, mark down how long each might (or should) take. This part will take practice because we tend to give ourselves too much time for tasks—and that's bad for multiple reasons. First, you need a bit of urgency and stress (but not too much) to make you productive, so you need a limited amount of time. Second, the longer you give yourself to work, the more you'll drag out that work—and the less you'll get done. Give yourself a few weeks to get in the swing of cutting down the amount of time you estimate each task will take, but commit yourself to eventually shrinking those windows. Then, grab the paper (or open the software) you’re using to time block and enter every single event and responsibility in, according to the time you’ve allotted for it. If you want to see how you are splitting up your day, choose different colors to classify tasks, like blue for grooming/bathing, yellow for work, and green for meals. Be strategic about which tasks make the cut on a given day, though. Use a prioritization technique like the Eisenhower Matrix to determine which of your tasks are actually pressing and which can be bumped to another day. Then, use a to-do list organizing method like 1-2-3 to divvy up your daily time correctly. Remember, your time in a day is finite, so you can't do everything all at once. With 1-2-3, you select one major task, two medium-sized ones, and three smaller ones to do in a day. The smaller ones can be building blocks for the big one or can be simple maintenance activities like answering emails or picking up the dry cleaning.The trick after that is to treat each box the same way you’d treat a meeting: Don’t reschedule it. Don’t mess with it too much. Honor the time commitment it represents, commit to doing the task at the specified time, and do your best to get it done in the time you set aside to do it. This is called time boxing, a similar but slightly different concept that involves giving yourself a set amount of time to do something, only focusing on that task during that time, and stopping your work when the time is up. I've written more extensively on the similarities and differences between time boxing and time blocking, but all you need to know right now is that during the time you set aside to do something on your calendar, you should engage completely in deep work, avoid distractions, and turn all your energy toward the responsibility at hand. As with any pre-planned meeting or event, things will come up that disrupt the schedule, but in the absence of a major upheaval (the kind of thing you’d move a work meeting for), vow to stick with your time blocks.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's smart here to also implement some kind of time tracking, whether that involves writing down how long your tasks actually take you or using a software to monitor your work, so you can make adjustments to your time blocks as you get better at following the system. During the first week or two, you'll likely be guessing at how long each task will take you when you're building the schedule, but after a while, you should be able to identify if something takes a longer or shorter amount of time than you've been allotting, then adjust the schedule to match those needs going forward.The reason time blocking worksTime blocking is beloved by its adherents. As the Harvard Business Review points out, a regular to-do list gives you way too many choices and not enough structure. Adding in the time element helps you stay on task. Making a visual, color-coded representation of that time keeps you focused and helps you ensure you always know exactly what you're supposed to be doing. There is no more indecision paralysis. You look at your Google Calendar and simply know what to do and how long you have to do it. Plus, if you use a shared calendar with colleagues or your family, everyone else will also know when you're available and what you're doing. It also helps you meet deadlines and stay within your guidelines. If you know a certain project or task will take a combined 50 hours, time blocking helps you space those out and make room for them in your schedule, enabling you to get things done on a set timetable without having to guess whether you really have time for it. If you finish something ahead of schedule, great! Go ahead and add in a little block of time off.A final note on time blockingTime blocking is often confused with time boxing and a lot of productivity blogs and hacks will say \"time boxing\" when they mean time blocking. That Harvard Business Review article above does it, for instance. It's an easy mistake to make and, in fact, in a previous version of this post, I called time blocking time boxing. As long as you're sticking to the plan and making a detailed calendar, it doesn't matter what you're calling it, but this could cause some confusion while you read up on other guides, so just be warned.

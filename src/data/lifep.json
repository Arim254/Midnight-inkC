Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.If you have a Premium Family plan through Spotify, there's good news: You can now set up managed accounts for your kids. Not only can you control what they listen to, their music choices won't reflect in or affect your listening history. Congratulations: You're getting your Wrapped back.    On Tuesday, Spotify announced it is rolling out managed accounts for Premium subscribers to seven new regions: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Premium Family subscribers in these countries can now create managed accounts for users younger than 13 that allow those users to listen on their own, in a controlled environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nManaged accounts are music-only, so younger listeners can't browse Spotify's other offerings, such as podcasts, or send or receive DMs. In addition, account managers can control a number of settings on these accounts, including whether the account can listen to explicit music, choose to block specific artists and songs, and decide to hide video—including short-form Canvas content.While Spotify has an existing service designed for children, Spotify Kids, it's much different, as it only contains music hand-picked for the service, and doesn't allow subscribers to control the account. Managed accounts allow subscribers to give a full Spotify experience to their kids, while having total control over what they can listen to. Personally, I think this is a fantastic feature. As someone who grew up in the early days of iTunes, I would have loved the ability to add whatever songs I wanted to my playlists—assuming my parents gave those songs the OK, of course. It's also great that kids can get recommendations for new music from Spotify. If they are obsessed with the latest trending song, perhaps Spotify can recommend similar tunes, both contemporary tracks as well as classics. It could be a great way to expand kids' music tastes.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify first tested managed accounts in 10 other countries: New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Columbia. It's now available as part of its Premium Family plan, which costs $19.99 per month.   How to create a managed accountIf you're using the Spotify mobile app, head to Settings and privacy > Account > Premium Family. If you're on your account page on Spotify's website, choose \"Manage members.\" Either way, under Plan members, choose to add members to your plan. Choose \"Add a listener aged under 13,\" then choose \"Add account.\"You'll then follow the on-screen steps to confirm you are the parent or guardian of the listener; set a PIN to control the experience; choose the name and birthdate of the listener; and choose your settings. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the weekend, multiple Reddit users complained that their Pixel 10 phones, which only just hit the market in August, were already facing severe slowdowns and frequent crashes while trying to load apps. Worse yet, the problem seemed to persist across all apps and models of the phone, leaving users with little they could actually do on their new devices. \"If an app does open and load it won't let me touch anything and it crashes,\" user cdriese said, with a number of others sharing a similar sentiment.The unfortunate news took me as a bit of a surprise, since I experienced no such issues while reviewing the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro at launch, both of which I quite liked. But the problem, it seems, only popped up recently. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMultiple users across Reddit pointed to October 10's Google Play Services update as the culprit here, with some saying that uninstalling the update fixed the problem for them. \"My running theory is that the October play services update is clashing with the September Android OS update in some way,\" said user PuzzleHeadedSquid, adding that they have had no crashes since uninstalling the Play Services update. Sure enough, when I loaded my phone with both the September Android OS update and the initial October play services updates installed, I also started to have issues.In a way, though, that's still a relief. Your new hardware isn't broken already—but uninstalling the new Play Services update introduces its own headaches. Luckily, as of this morning, there's another solution, and it's pretty simple.If you're experiencing crashing apps on your Pixel 10, here's what you can do.The official fixRandom Reddit users weren't the only folks experiencing this problem. Android Police founder Artem Russakovskii also called out the problem in an October 12 X post, saying his Pixel 10 Pro XL had been \"kneecapped\" by it.\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nLuckily, as a member of the press, he had a bit more resources at his disposal for fixing this bug than the average Redditor. Over the course of the weekend, Russakovskii quickly got in touch with his contacts at Google, who he says scrambled multiple teams to address the issue and has since issued a server-side fix.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTheoretically, that means a simple restart should bring your phone back to normal, although if the problem persists, you'll also want to make sure you're running the most recent Google Play services build (which you can check under Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details), then do another restart.It's a pretty quick turnaround on a fix, and doesn't require much on your part, but if you've temporarily shelved your Pixel, it's worth booting it back up again to see if you're still having issues.The unofficial fixThat said, it's possible Google's engineers still might have missed something. If you still find yourself having issues loading apps, you can use the community method of uninstalling the October Play Services update instead. This will log you out of your Google accounts, however, and won't include Google's official fix, so I'd only recommend it in an emergency.That said, if you're at the point of pulling your hair out, you can navigate to Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details and tap \"Remove updates\" to start the process. Just be sure to have your Google passwords (or passkeys!) memorized first.First, though, try hitting the \"Update\" button next to it instead, then restarting your phone. That's what I did, after initially running my testing without this morning's update, and my apps are now as snappy as ever.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I have recommended it for studying, used it for my own work loads of times, and generally found it to be one of the best bits of software available right now. But recently, I tried using it on my phone, not just on my computer browser—and it fell surprisingly flat. Here's how I've been managing to use it via mobile, anyway, and why you should stick to the computer version for now. What is NotebookLM?NotebookLM is a language model that only uses resources you provide. Like ChatGPT, it can offer summaries, outlines, and studying or organizational help, but unlike ChatGPT, it's not pulling from the World Wide Web to do that. Instead, you upload PDFs, links, plain text, and documents and, when you ask it a question, it relies only on those to give you an answer. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHere's a practical example.: I use it a lot when I'm writing an article that features a load of interviews. I copy and paste my interview transcripts into NotebookLM, then prompt it, to, say, \"Find me three quotes about the value of good sleep.\" If three of my sources mentioned how important it is to get a good night's rest, I'll get three quotes right away, plus a hyperlink to where they each appear in their respective interview, so I can go back and read the context around them. It makes being organized so much easier and I don't waste time searching, word by word, through every transcript for what I need. For studying, it's even better. You can upload all the slide decks, e-texts, and notes you have from a class, then ask it to generate practice quizzes, flashcards, summaries, or essay outlines. One of its coolest features is that it will even create a fake podcast, complete with two hosts who have vocal ticks and even vocal fry. The two AI hosts discuss the material from your sources in an informational, conversational way, like a real podcaster might, and you can listen to it and learn wherever you are. It's been incredibly helpful for me, and it doesn't feel unethical to use, like other AI chatbots, because it's synthesizing information I already found, compiled, and put the work in on. It doesn't feel like I'm cheating when I use it; instead, it feels like I'm getting a little boost in my organization, but still doing most of the work. Plus, there's never a risk that it will make up a fake fact or pull in information that is irrelevant or faulty, like there is with ChatGPT. It relies only on what you give it. The mobile app problemAll of that said, I became and stayed obsessed with this after only using it on my desktop browser for the last six months or so. Last weekend, though, I was studying for an upcoming certification exam and was, as usual, using NotebookLM to generate flashcards, quizzes, and fake podcasts. But I was also cleaning my apartment and doing the laundry, which involved a lot of running to and from the laundromat. I decided to use the NotebookLM iPhone app so I could study on the go; I assumed that since the product is so stellar on the computer, it would be great on the app, too. It was not.On the app, all you can do is review your sources, talk to the chatbot, and listen to your generated podcasts. Here's what you can't do:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGenerate flashcardsReview existing flashcardsGenerate a quizTake existing quizzesSelect the sources from which you make a podcast, quiz, flashcards, or chat topicOne of the best things about the browser version is you can toggle sources on and off. So, if you upload a separate PDF for five different book chapters, you can select only Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 before generating a quiz or flashcards, for instance. If you keep them all selected, your quizzes, flashcards, podcasts, or chats will pull from all of them. By narrowing the scope, you can study more specifically. You can't do that on the app, but it doesn't actually matter because you can't generate (or use) anything on the app, anyway. You can generate a podcast, but only one that pulls from all your sources. The other features—quizzes and flashcards—aren't available at all. Workarounds for NotebookLMThe first workaround I found was a little annoying: I generated a podcast for every chapter using my computer, then listened to them through the mobile app on my phone while I ran my errands. I had to stay on top of my schedule, bouncing from cleaning to laundromat to computer and back again, so I wouldn't find myself without a study podcast to review, but all in all, I got the hang of it. You can't do this for flashcards, quizzes, or mind maps, but if you're after the podcasts, this works with some pre-planning.The second workaround is not to use the app at all. Most websites and companies want to push you toward app use, presumably for data-collection purposes, but never forget there is a browser on your phone, too. I navigated to the NotebookLM website on my mobile browser and, though it's smaller and harder to navigate than the computer, have been able to use it to generate flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and more. You can check and uncheck sources on the mobile browser version, which is ideal. I'm hopeful the app will improve. NotebookLM is such a great resource that has helped me a ton, but it would be much better if it were more usable in its app format. I can't always be attached to my laptop; the real value of studying with flashcards, especially, is that they should be accessible and reviewable anywhere via my phone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Drugs, death, and depravity are probably what come to mind whenever you hear about the dark web. Or, is it the deep web? Is it both? You might find yourself conflating the two terms, with the assumption that both the dark web and the deep web are the same place—a spot people flock to for reasons that include illegal and/or generally shady activities. But while the dark web is a part of the deep web, the deep web isn’t really the dark web. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe \"regular internet\" is the surface webI need to start this explanation with a different term altogether: The internet as most of us know it is called the “surface web.” (Perhaps you've also heard it called the open web or visible web.) Essentially, it’s a collection of sites that are indexed by search engines. If it pops up in a Google search, it’s a part of the surface web. This article, for example, is a part of the surface web; CNET's homepage is a part of the surface web; the Facebook login screen is a part of the surface web. Most of the internet you're familiar with is likely covered under this definition. That’s not the case with the deep web or the dark web. You can’t open Chrome and expect to find any dark web pages via a Google search. For the deep web, you'll need to visit each website individually, and, in the case of the dark web, while using a special browser altogether. What exactly is the deep web?Also known as the “hidden” web, the deep web is the collection of sites that aren’t indexed by search engines. Most of these sites are obscured behind login pages, and can range from banking and email pages, to paywalled content like streaming sites. Sure, you’ll find Netflix via a Google search, but you won’t find the player for Love Is Blind, Season 9, Episode 1 unless you log into the site first. The deep web also consists of protocol pages, responsible for identifying user accounts when you log in to a site, running payments when you make a purchase, and other processes you never need to see. In short, it’s both the backbone of the internet, as well as a part of the internet you regularly interact with yourself. And it's actually what makes up most of the internet: According to CrowdStrike, the deep web accounts for over 90% of all content online. Deep web pages aren’t indexed, but they often have URLs that can be linked to directly, and are accessible from traditional web browsers like Chrome or Firefox. In your daily life online, you frequently jump between the surface web and the deep web, likely without realizing it. When you open your bank's website, that's the surface web. When you log into your account, your balance and investments are hosted on the deep web. When you open a YouTube video, that's the surface web. If you access your YouTube account's settings page, that's the deep web. You jump through these hoops all the time, but fear not: Your frequent deep web activity never puts you in danger of accessing the dark web. What exactly is the dark web?The dark web is a subsection (a small one, at that) of the deep web. But unlike the latter, the dark web is not accessible via a typical web browser like Chrome or Firefox. That's because it's not just hidden by login pages or hidden URLs; the dark web uses both encryption and routing to mask its websites, as well as proxy servers to host requests and traffic without any centralized regulation. This is still the deep web, it's just not a part of it you'd ever stumble upon by accident.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to access the dark webIf you want to access the dark web, you need special tools to do so. A specific browser, such as Tor, for example, is required to get started. Just as you use Chrome to access public internet sites like Facebook or Lifehacker, you use a dark web browser to access dark web pages. It's also common to know the specific dark web site you want to visit ahead of time; these often end in .onion instead of .com. While the dark web does have its own search engines, like Ahmia, Torch, and even a special version of DuckDuckGo, they are not as robust as the search engines you're used to.   Since you need special protocols to access these sites, that traffic is often private and anonymous. That’s what makes the dark web an attractive option for illegal activities—the site activity isn’t as easily traced back to individual user accounts. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the common tender on the dark web, since it also protects your privacy during transactions. The dark web isn't just illegal stuffWhen you think of the “dark web,” you probably imagine an underground, secretive network of sites, where illegal activities are aplenty, passing drugs, contraband, and illicit media with reckless abandon. You might also hear about data leaks ending up on the dark web, with bad actors paying for your passwords, hacked accounts, and credit card info. Those sites surely exist, but they’re only one part of what’s known as the dark web, which isn't only a playground for the perverse and malicious. While many common use-cases for the dark web might be against the law, anyone with a reason to be anonymous online can utilize the networks. Common examples of “good” on the dark web are whistleblowers who need a place to leak their information without having the governments and organizations responsible for that data knowing who they are, as well as legitimate news and information sites for citizens of countries with strict censorship laws. One study from 2020 estimates that 57% of the dark web contains illegal content. If true, that's a lot, but it also means the other 43% isn't breaking the law.  In short, the deep web is not a scary place. The dark web can be, but not always.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.While sometimes there's a big piece of misinformation that a lot of people latch onto—like The Rapture or the existence of \"MedBeds\"—the fractured nature of the information sphere has all but killed the overarching conspiracy theory. No longer do big ideas like \"we never went to the moon\" unite the dumbest minds; instead, the algorithm creates bespoke conspiracy theories. So instead of joining the Flat Earth Society, you might think the actual year is 1728, or that AI secretly imagined a British comedian from the the 1980s and seeded the web with evidence of his existence.But how does it start? And how quickly can social media platforms transform someone from a person from a seeker-of-knowledge to a believer-in-bullshit? YouTuber Benaminute recently posted a video where he dug in to find out. His question: If you start with a benign, broad, randomly chosen subject, and you only watch videos having to do with that subject, how long will it take until TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels feed you a conspiracy theory video? The answer: not long at all. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDifferent topics all lead to the same place (more or less) For the experiment, Benaminute created \"blank\" social media profiles and behaved like someone who was innocently curious about one of three topics—dinosaurs, The Vietnam War, and the 2000 presidential election. He put the keyword in each platform's search bar and only watched and liked videos about the initial subject. DinosaursYouTube Shorts: The initial videos were ads for Jurassic Park, AI slop featuring dinosaurs, and the occasional educational video, but the 541st video was a clip from the Joe Rogan Experience about how the pyramids were not tombs, but \"DNA restoration devices.\"TikTok: If you thought TikTok would get to conspiracy theories quickly, you'd be right. The 144th video was this fake UFO video that has 24 million views. Instagram Reels: Insta took 661 videos to get from dinosaurs to a \"forbidden phone from the 2000s that lets you see into a parallel dimension.\"The Vietnam WarThings get worse for people interested in historical or political events. On all short-form platforms, an interest in Vietnam will lead you pretty quickly to right-leaning content, which leads you to conspiracy theories. YouTube Shorts got to a conspiracy theory video about Noah's Ark in only seven videos. TikTok took a little longer; video 161 was about how financial services company Blackrock had something to do with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Reels took 139 videos to get to \"Bush did 9/11.\" The 2000 electionThe election of 2000 is still a charged topic, but it's been awhile, so maybe cooler heads and verified information will win the day? Spoiler: nope. YouTube Shorts took 136 videos to get to the same Noah's Ark conspiracy as it did for dinosaur fans.TikTok only took 38 videos to get to \"The Rapture is happening on September 24.\"Reels took only 26 videos to land on \"The World Trade Center was bombed\" (by either Clinton or Bush). Which social media app leads to conspiracy theories fastest?The champion of \"normal search to conspiracy theory\" speed runs is TikTok, with an average of 114 videos or 57 minutes of watching. YouTube Shorts comes in second with 230 videos or 1 hour 57 minutes of time, and Reels takes 275 video or 138 minutes. It's a distinction without a difference; however, all three platforms lead to conspiracies in the time it takes to watch a Marvel movie. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does it all mean? It would be easy to conclude that the massive tech companies that built YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok companies weight their recommendation engines so viewers are led to fake stories. Maybe they have specific political aims and are trying to sway votes, or maybe (as Benaminute posits in a semi-tongue-in-cheek way) these apps are built to \"keep us angry, divided, and distracted\" from realizing the conflict isn't between Left and Right, but between \"up and down.\" This is also a conspiracy theory, however. I'm not saying he's wrong, but we don't have enough information to know why algorithms recommend conspiracy content. It could be because bad actors at the top demand specific results for some purpose, but it seems more likely to me that TikTok et al. don't have an agenda beyond making money.\\I have no doubt that a social media platform featuring an algorithm that weighs the truth heavily would fail pretty quickly; the Truth is boring compared to conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories, broadly, make believers feel special, like they have inside knowledge the rest of us lack. People scroll TikTok to have fun; the truth usually isn't fun.  Conspiracy theorist can say things like \"UFOs are here!\" or \"They're turning the frogs gay!\" Meanwhile, if you're devoted to the truth, you mostly have to go with \"the best evidence suggests...\" or \"it seems logical that...\" and who wants to hear that?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

It already had a streaming box called an Apple TV, and a pay-per-view app called Apple TV, so it needed to call its subscription-based streaming platform something else. But everyone I've ever talked to about an Apple TV+ show, whether online or in-person, tends to drop the \"plus\" from the name, perhaps even forgetting it was there in the first place—especially because the aforementioned, plus-less pay-per-view app is still where you go to actually watch your Apple TV+ content. Now, it seems, even Apple is giving up on the name, and just doing the same intuitive thing all my friends and family have already been doing for years, because at the bottom of a press release earlier today, the company quietly admitted that Apple TV+ will now just be called Apple TV.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy Apple TV+ is no moreDespite the conflict with other Apple products, it makes sense...mostly. Apple TV+ is a mouthful, and a bit redundant, and sounds too much like Paramount+ or Disney+ (a service I don't like very much). My brain just naturally wants to call the app where I watch Apple content \"Apple TV\" instead. It's also arguable that calling the platform Apple TV+ implies you need Apple TV hardware to watch it, so arguably the new name is more descriptive than the old one.That said, as smart as the decision is, Apple is burying the announcement. It came at the end of a post about F1 The Movie's subscription streaming premiere (set for Dec. 12, by the way), and in a way taht wasn't very descriptive. All we know is that, according to the company, \"Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.\" As of this writing, neither the Apple TV app or the Apple TV+ website have been updated to match this new moniker, so your guess is as good as mine as to what the rebrand will look like once it goes live. It could be a big new relaunch, with a new UI, or it could be a quiet change that Apple will try to sneak by with as little fanfare as possible.At any rate, if you see Apple TV+ branding disappear from your Apple TV app, that's why. All your subscription content will still be there, just without a plus symbol next to it. The big dangling question, then, is how this will affect Apple's pay-per-view store, or its Apple TV hardware.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat will become of the old Apple TV?For the former, it seems like it won't be a big change, as Apple's F1 blog admits that while the movie isn't available for streaming via the newly rechristened Apple TV subscription yet, but is purchasable only in the wider Apple TV app. That implies that the subscription service and the rest of the app will both continue to operate as separate entities going forward, and while it's a bit confusing for them to share a name, I can't say that calling the service Apple TV+ was every a great solution to that problem. Instead, subscription shows will probably just get a slight visual change to the section they already live under in the Apple TV app.But how will this affect hardware—specifically the Apple tV streaming box? I could see that being a bit more confusing. Imagine a less literate family member buying a physical Apple TV at Walmart, only to realize they still have to pay for a subscription to actually watch Apple TV shows. For all its faults, at least \"Apple TV+\" did imply buying Apple's streaming box didn't automatically give you access to its shows (even if, again, you can watch those shows without Apple TV hardware).That said, it's possible a solution for that is forthcoming: According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a consistently accurate predictor of all things Apple, the company is set to announce a new slate of MacBook hardware sometime later this week. Could the Apple TV+ name change imply that we'll see a rebranded Apple TV streaming box alongside these new laptops? We may find out soon.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

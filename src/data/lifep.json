    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n            Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n    \n        \n        Finding great travel deals is a skill, but it’s one that can be honed—if you know where to source a bargain, can be patient and flexible, and if you take advantage of the 24-hour free federal cancelation policy to lock in a time-sensitive opportunity. One unusual way to save on your travels? There are websites that let you buy other people's non-refundable vacations, from flights to hotels to cruises, that they are looking to offload. If this sounds intriguing, it can be a great way to save—although you might not find Black Friday travel deals like you might on tech products, people have to cancel or give up on travel plans all year round. With that said, here are some of the best travel websites and tools you can use to snag your next trip on the cheap.Google Flights' explore toolI expect most people to know this one, but I have to start the list somewhere. For those who might not know, Google Flights has an “explore” tool where you see a map of your potential destinations from your local airport and their prices. This is great when you don't have a specific destination in mind but want to get away and see where you could potentially travel to. You can scroll through the planet and find some bargains that you might've never seen otherwise. Quick tip: If you have a budget, use the filters on the top left to set it and see where you can afford to travel to around the world. Use Skyscanner to find the cheapest flightsYes, Google Flights is more user-friendly and has cool features, but if you mean business and are looking for the cheapest flight options you can find, Skyscanner is what you want to use. Here, you’ll find flights that will not even appear on Google Flights, and it even has an explore-like tool similar to Google’s where you simply input your local airport, select “whole month” for dates, and click “search” to find all the possible low-cost destinations for that month (I found a direct flight to Cancun from my home in Atlanta for $183). You can catch last-minute flight deals and set alerts for cheap flights as well.Shop second-hand vacation packages from people who can't get refundsImagine you buy a whole package deal for a family vacation months in advance but, like most people, you forego the travel insurance. You have a family emergency and can no longer take the trip. What can you do? Sell your vacation on the internet. Websites like Sparefare, Roomer, Plans Change, and Transfer Travel let you buy other people's vacations that they can no longer use themselves. You can both save money and get these people out of a sticky situation. Here's a quick breakdown of your options:TransferTravelTransferTravel is like the Facebook Marketplace of travel plans. You can find anything from cruises, to flights, to hotels, events, and more. It's the most wide-ranging of all of these websites that offer transferable travel products. SpareFareSpareFare focuses on flight tickets or vouchers, hotel reservations, and holiday packages. You'll be connected directly with the seller to get their non-refundable bookings. SpareFare also helps you manage the name change process for airline tickets, which can get a bit complicated if you do it by yourself.RoomerIf you're focusing on finding hotels at a bargain, use Roomer. The website focuses on showing you non-refundable bookings from people desperately trying to recoup any money they can. You can find hotels from all over the world and filter by number of occupants, dates, and location. You might not always find something available where you're staying, but if you do, you'll be a happy camper. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlansChangePlansChange is exactly like Roomer, but it's smaller in scope and reach. It doesn't hurt to check both when you find yourself looking for a bargain stay.Use SecretFlying to set up alerts for their “Error Fares”Airlines make mistakes sometimes, and as a savvy traveler, you need to be ready to take advantage of them when you can. SecretFlying is a travel deal website that works like many others, but it also has  a special tool to find cheap flights that exist because of mistakes that airlines make. (For example, there was an enticing Chicago to London round-trip for only $58 last month.) The error fares go fast, and many might not logistically work for you, but if you ever do catch one of these, you’ll be bragging about it for years to come. Use the Travel Arrow extensionIf you're still only using Google Flights to do your searching, you could be missing out on some cheaper options. Travel Arrow is an extension you can install on your browser that will cross-reference your Google Flight info on Skyscanner, Kayak, Trip, and Expedia (all the major competitors to Google Flights). While it doesn't always work, it's a free tool that will more than pay for itself if you ever end up booking a cheaper flight with it. Keep in mind that some flights might be cheaper because their layovers are longer.Use these online vacation package websitesThere are many websites that sell you travel packages that include flights, hotels, food, tours, and even transportation (rails, buses, taxis, etc.) for much cheaper than you would find if you tried to book each piece individually. The catch is that these packages are typically strict on dates, and their cancellation policies are often less forgiving. But you’ll be able to find amazing deals at locations you might not otherwise be able to afford. Gate1, for example, has been around since the '80s—my mom has used it with my dad to visit the eight wonders of the world on a budget over the years. Their best deals come from their weekly specials (you can sign up for their emails) and last-minute deals where you can find multi-day trips for big discounts. For example, you can do a 13-day Thailand trip for $2,249 with all this included:Roundtrip flights Los Angeles to Bangkok, or Bangkok to Los Angeles Intra-flight Chiang Mai to Bangkok11 nights First Class accommodationsHotel taxes, fees, service charges, and porterage18 meals: 11 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 4 dinnersSightseeing per itinerary in modern air-conditioned motor coachServices of English-speaking tour manager throughoutEntrance fees per itineraryHere are some other websites similar to Gate1 where you can find great deals on packages for your next trip:TravelPiratesGreat Value VacationsGoing (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights)\n            ",

The update rolls out a major multitasking redesign that introduces macOS-like windows, a macOS-like menu bar, and a macOS-like file management. The iPad even has the Preview app, for crying out loud—though, to be fair, so does the iPhone.  Apple has toed the line with its tablets over the years, introducing features and functions that make the experience more like using a computer, while never really committing to the bit entirely. To that point, iPadOS 26 probably won't replace your MacBook, but it comes pretty close. If your major concerns have to do with things like window and file management, this update is likely up your alley. But even as this new iPad era seems all about a more traditional computing affair, Apple is going backwards a bit, but in a very good way: The latest iPadOS update brings back a fan-favorite multitasking feature: Slide Over. Slide Over makes window management easierPrior to iPadOS 26, Slide Over had been a cornerstone of multitasking on Apple's tablets for years. While you could have multiple apps open at once in varying window sizes, Slide Over let you designate an app window that kept more of an iOS shape—specifically something long and vertical. As the name implies, this window could slide over from the ride side of the display whenever it was needed, and could easily slide back when it wasn't. It was perfect for keeping a social media feed or a messaging app at hand while working on something else: Imagine having two windows open on your iPhone, one for Safari and one for Google Docs, but whenever you needed to send a text, you could pull a Messages window out from the right side of the screen, and swipe it away when it was time to get back to work. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe Mac has no equivalent to this, of course, as it relies on standard window management. Perhaps Apple thought that if iPadOS 26 also had more of a standard window management, it no longer needed Slide Over. As such, the company removed the feature as part of its big iPad update this fall. It's not clear whether Apple received negative feedback about this omission, or whether the company decided it missed the feature as well, but regardless of the reasoning, Slide Over is back as of iPadOS 26.1.Slide Over is a little different with iPadOS 26.1\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThat said, t feature doesn't work exactly the same as it used to. In order to use it, you need to be using your iPad in Stage Manager or windowed mode, which you can choose from Control Center, or from Settings > Multitasking & Gestures.From here, open an app for which you want to use Slide Over. Long press on the window controls in the top-left corner of the app window, then choose \"Enter Slide Over.\" The app will squish into an iOS-like window on the right side of the display, and you can dismiss it by swiping it away. You can also resize the window into whatever shape or size you want, while still retaining that Slide Over ability. In the image above, you'll see that I shrunk my Apple Music window into more of a square, but you can make it as big as you want—though that might defeat the purpose of setting it as a Slide Over window. How to update to iPadOS 26.1 (and beyond)If you haven't yet done so, you can install the 26.1 update right now from Settings > General > Software Update. In addition to Slide Over, you'll find some other neat features and changes, like the ability to control how Liquid Glass looks on your iPad. If you're a beta tester, you'll skip right over iPadOS 26.1, as Apple is currently testing iPadOS 26.2. The public beta is currently available, and lets you add alarms to reminders for the first time.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The app that can turn your notes into a podcast can now generate an educational video based on your study materials. It can also create a report or document from suggested, pre-made templates. How the new NotebookLM tools workIf you're unfamiliar, NotebookLM is a large language model akin to the better-known chatbot ChatGPT, but instead of pulling information from all over the internet (with all the risks of inaccuracy that creates), it relies only on material you input directly. You can upload PDFs, links, YouTube videos, plain text, and more, then ask the chatbot questions and it will answer based only on what you've given it, even providing links to where it finds the answers in the source material. As noted, it can also generate AI podcasts, which feature two voices discussing your materials, as well as flashcards, mind maps, or practice quizzes. Video and report generation are the latest additions to NotebookLM's toolset. You can try them out by locating the appropriate tile along the right side of the screen within your NotebookLM notebook. (Though the app is, frankly, underwhelming, so I recommend always using a desktop computer or mobile browser  instead.)How video generation worksThe educational videos are excellent for students or anyone trying to learn something new. I generated one based on the materials I've been using within NotebookLM to study for an upcoming certification exam, and though it definitely took over the promised five minutes to create, it came out surprisingly good:\nContent from my study guides and materials is included, with key information highlighted visually and with further explanation from a voiceover. How to generate reports with NotebookLMThe reports are a little more complex. When I pressed Report, I got options like, \"Anatomy Explainer\" and \"Business Development Plan\" as suggested choices based on my material. \"Briefing,\" \"Study Guide,\" and \"Blog Post\" are standard suggestions that are always available. I asked a friend who also uses NotebookLM to study for school, and their suggested formats for their Management Concepts class materials were \"Strategic Analysis\" and \"Leadership Profile.\"So it seems that based on what your materials include, the software will create outlines in downloadable document format. I selected \"Anatomy Explainer\" and, after waiting a few minutes, got a detailed study doc divided into sections like \"The Command Center: Your Nervous System\" and \"The Framework: Your Skeletal System.\" It was outlined clearly, like a study guide with more explanation and context. Why I love these new featuresI am a major proponent of using NotebookLM for studying, particularly, because it's such an easy way to organize your materials and make sure that your work aligns with what your teacher is looking for. Plus, unlike ChatGPT, you can't exactly use it to do all the work for you; instead, it shows you where it got the information (from materials you provided), enabling you to study more efficiently. The videos and reports are another way to do that, so whether you study best by listing to audio, watching videos, mind-mapping, drilling flashcards, or reading summaries, it's an ideal choice. You can even ask the chatbot followup questions on anything you don't grasp. The reports, especially, have implications for other kinds of work, beyond studying. I use NotebookLM to help me organize my files and materials for my job all the time, so the ability to create a briefing doc or business plan is an added bonus that could be helpful to people in a variety of fields. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Flight cancellations under the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) government shutdown order have begun, with hundreds of flights and thousands of travelers across 40 U.S. airports affected. This could continue for as long as the shutdown lasts (and potentially impact many more travelers as the busy holiday season approaches). While flight cancellations are never fun, the cascading effect of due to the government shutdown could make dealing with one even more frustrating. Here are four actions you should take right away if your itinerary is cut. Enable alerts from your airlineFlight cancellations often happen with little to no notice, sometimes when you're already en route to your destination, and airlines are certainly scrambling to comply with the FAA's shutdown order. As they continue to pare down their schedules, there's a chance your flight may be cut well before you head to the airport. \nTo keep yourself in the loop, download your airline's app and turn on push notifications so you receive status updates as soon as they're available—and keep an eye on your email and text messages for additional alerts. Check your rebooking options ASAPAirlines will often automatically rebook passengers whose flights are canceled on the next available alternative—so again, make sure you have your airline's app on your phone to quickly view your options. If the airline offers this, you can accept the rebooked itinerary, choose a different one, or reject it and get a refund instead. Going through the mobile app is likely to be much faster than queuing at the customer service counter or trying to get through over the phone. (Though if you do need to talk to an actual person at your airline, we've got a guide for that.)Of course, you should check your airline's guidance specific to shutdown cancellations. Frontier, for example, is waiving change and cancellation fees and allowing passengers to request a rebooked itinerary or refund, but you may not automatically be placed on the next flight. United is offering rebooking options as well as refunds to anyone who chooses not to travel, even if their flight isn't affected. You'll find relevant advisories on your airline's website (for example, Delta, American, JetBlue, and Southwest). Know what you're entitled toIf your flight is canceled less than 14 days before departure and you choose not to travel, you are entitled to a refund—even if you booked a nonrefundable or basic economy ticket. Airlines may offer travel credits or vouchers first, but you can try to request cash if that's your preference. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can look up your airline's standard commitments in the event of \"controllable\" cancellations on the Department of Transportation's Airline Cancellation and Delay Dashboard, but you should also check the policies specific to the FAA flight reduction as outlined above. Consider booking a backupIf your trip is an absolute must, you may want to book a back-up option at a different time, on a different airline, or through an alternative airport. While there's no guarantee that this flight won't also be canceled, it does at least increase your odds of getting to your destination with a confirmed seat while other affected travelers are being rebooked on itineraries hours or days later. You can buy a refundable ticket—knowing you'll either get to where you need to go or get the extra money back if your original itinerary works out—or use points and miles, which are often easily deposited back into your account if you cancel your ticket. Be sure to check the terms and conditions of your rewards program. You can also look into travel insurance, which will usually fully refund your purchase, albeit for a fee\n            ",

It was a clever way of ensuring than your iPhone didn't unlock in your pocket, or due to an accidental touch. With iOS 10, Apple killed slide to unlock in favor of pressing the Home button, then later swiping up on the bottom of the screen. Since then, for the better part of a decade, swiping right on the Lock Screen simply takes you to the \"Today View,\" which contains your widgets. Change is good, and I don't necessarily think Apple should bring back slide to unlock for the Lock Screen, but sometimes, I miss how things worked on my old iPhone 3GS. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. To my absolute surprise, however, the company is bringing back the slide function—just not to unlock. Instead, you're now able to slide to stop your alarms, which might come as a surprise to anyone used to the usual alarm routine. Imagine it: One morning, you're tapping to turn off your alarm as usual; the next, your taps are fruitless, and your alarm keeps blaring. Bleary-eyed, you look at your screen, to find a new \"Slide to stop\" function. If you're like me, you'll follow instructions, sliding to stop the alarm, only to forget the whole ordeal within moments, doomed to repeat the affair the next morning. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis change arrives as part of iOS 26.1, which dropped on Monday, and Apple doesn't give you any say in the matter—at least, not at first. After updating to the latest update, your next alarm or timer will include the next slider (though \"snooze\" or \"repeat\" remain buttons), but the switch up is fine by me. I like it, and it brings back a fun feature from iOS' heyday. But if you dislike the change, and you wish you could simply tap a button to silence your alarms and timers, the good news is, you still can. How to disable \"slide to stop alarm\"Apple buried the option to revert your alarm and timers back to the way they used to be, so I wouldn't blame you for not knowing they even exist. You won't find them in the Clock app's settings page, which is confusing. Instead, it's part of a hidden system-wide setting, called \"Prefer Single-Touch Actions.\"  This setting will disable sliders across iOS, and replace them with buttons. For our purposes, that turns \"Slide to stop\" back into a simple off button. To find it, head to Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then enable the toggle next to \"Prefer Single-Touch Action.\" \n    \n            \n            Slide to stop (left) vs. stop button (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Technically, this also makes it clearer that the rule applies to everyone and not just those using the OpenAI API to build an app, but average users are unlikely to see a change.The important words here are \"provision\" and \"providing.\" The terms, as written, don't necessarily ban the average person from getting legal and health advice from ChatGPT, but instead discourages developers and hospitals or law offices from using the chatbot to give specific advice to a client without first checking in with a licensed professional. As an average person doing background research, you're unlikely to bump up against it, and there's no language indicating a change to the chatbot's functionality. In short, the update is intended as a rewording, not a change to rules, enforcement, or functionality.This is backed up by OpenAI's statement, which comes from the company's head of health AI Karan Singhal, and says \"ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDespite this, responses to OpenAI's statement denying a change to model behavior still claim to have seen more difficulty looking certain topics up, although it's important to note that OpenAI's release notes don't indicate any new model developments having been made since the update to the company's usage policies.On an anecdotal note, I was able to get ChatGPT to offer me advice on how to fight a traffic ticket in court, as well as suggest brands for a supplement a user said the model refused to provide specific advice about following the new policy update.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nWhile I cannot test every possible use case, the situation seems clear to me. Are you using ChatGPT or the OpenAI API to give others specifically tailored legal or health advice, without review by a licensed professional? If so, the same rules apply as before. If not, you're unlikely to see a change in your results.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

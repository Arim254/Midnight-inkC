Unfortunately, this is very much a scam.  As BleepingComputer reports, these promo emails were sent from addresses on b.grubhub.com, a legitimate Grubhub subdomain, so they appear verified in recipients' inboxes. Two examples of senders include [email protected] and [email protected]. Beyond that, there are some pretty clear red flags. The subject line reads \"30 minutes left - We'll 10x your Bitcoin!\" to promote a sense of urgency and an offer too good to be true (but also too good to ignore). The body includes the recipient's name and instructions on how to participate in Grubhub's \"Holiday Crypto Promotion\" with a bitcoin wallet address. While Grubhub has acknowledged the problem, they haven't released any details as to what facilitated attackers sending emails using a company address. The company did suffer a major security breach earlier this year, resulting in the leak of some user data (including names and email addresses). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are several varieties of the crypto reward scamThe Grubhub email promotion is a pretty typical example of a cryptocurrency scam. The Federal Trade Commission outlines several variants, including get-rich-quick schemes guaranteeing big returns on your investment and celebrity-promoted \"giveaways\" that claim to multiply any funds you send.If you fall for crypto fraud, there's no way to track or get your money back, and even if victims are few and far between, scammers can score big paydays. That's why you should be especially wary of anything and everything requiring a crypto transaction, especially if the offer sounds urgent or provokes a sense of either excitement or fear. And remember that no legitimate organization—government agency, law enforcement official, utility company, or prize promoter—will ever ask for payments in cryptocurrency.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you tell yourself, “I’ll only listen to my favorite podcast while I’m at the gym,” it takes just one moment of weakness to realize you can cheat and listen to it any time you want. Instead, try this: Reward yourself with something that has no enjoyment value whatsoever. Like a checkmark on your calendar. I first heard this tip from writer Tim Clare’s podcast. If you want to stay motivated, he says, the reward has to be so crappy that you’re not actually working for the reward. He said that he puts a checkmark on his calendar every day he writes, and at the end of the week enough checkmarks earn a gold star. The same approach has worked for me and for others. I have to admit: Buying myself a pack of stickers is embarrassingly motivating. Why stickers work better than \"real\" rewardsTim Clare likes the theory that this works because of cognitive dissonance: We have to change something major (our behavior) to earn something that's not valuable (a sticker), so we try to resolve that dissonance by deciding we value the behavior change. The crappy extrinsic reward strengthens our sense that the new habit is intrinsically valuable. And as my colleague Meredith Dietz has written, experts believe that the secret to lasting motivation lies in our intrinsic goals. Engaging in healthy behaviors like exercise only works if we're doing those behaviors for their own sake, not because we're enduring our gym time as a means to an end. Extrinsic rewards like streaks and badges can gamify this process so addictively that we lose sight of why we're actually doing it in the first place. Note that I'm not saying you should chase streaks; I'm thinking more like literal stickers on a piece of paper, or a note in your phone where you write down how many miles you ran this week. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nAnother type of ineffective reward is the real-life splurge: promising you'll treat yourself to something (a dessert, a clothing purchase) once you hit a certain goal. Here's the problem: If you hate exercising so much that you need a bribe to do it at all, you're quickly going to find a way to have the reward without the work. There's nothing actually stopping you from listening to that \"gym only\" podcast at home, or ordering yourself the new outfit you had earmarked as a reward for when you make it through the couch to 5K program. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsing a crappy reward works because it just reflects your existing motivation back on itself. You check off today's work, not because the checkmark is valuable in itself, but because the checkmark reminds you that you kept a promise to yourself. There's a thrill to closing that loop, and those little wins really build your self-efficacy. In self-efficacy theory, small wins boost your motivation to keep working toward bigger goals.  The best part of using stickers or checkmarks is that it’s pointless to cheat. What are you going to do—lie to yourself when you didn’t actually go to the gym? But building up that row of numbers or stickers becomes its own reward. You’re really just rewarding yourself with the satisfaction of having stuck to your habit.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

After years of relying on my traditional percussive massage guns, I've made the switch to the Rally Orbital Massager. And one by one, my friends have started following in my footsteps to make the same move. Hey, there's something validating about watching people you trust independently come to the same conclusion. Why I love the Rally Orbital MassagerDon't get me wrong—my Theragun still serves me well. It's been a reliable companion after workouts, helping ease tension and speed up recovery. But with the Rally, the orbital motion technology sets it apart immediately. Instead of the percussive hammering that defines traditional massage guns, the Rally uses a circular, multi-directional approach that feels more like the hands of a skilled massage therapist. (Or like a car buffer, as the founders described it to me on a phone call.) I'm simply more likely to reach for a device that feels good to use, rather than one that hurts. It's a game-changer for consistency. With my old massage gun, I'd psyche myself out before sessions: \"Do I really need this? Can I handle the intensity right now?\" With the Rally, there's no mental barrier. I can use it while watching TV, during work breaks, or as part of my bedtime routine, without dreading the experience.At the same time, let me be upfront: At regularly $499 (and currently on sale for $399), the Rally Orbital Massager isn't cheap. It's a significant step up in price from most massage guns on the market, including the Theragun. It's probably not an impulse buy. Still, it's an investment that helps me maintain the active lifestyle I value. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom lineStarting 2026 with this upgrade feels right. My Theragun will still have a place in my recovery arsenal—it's way too useful to completely retire—but the Rally has quickly become my go-to device. The difference in how my muscles feel, the reduction in soreness, and the overall quality of the recovery experience have made it worth every penny.If you're serious about recovery and you're in a position to make the investment, I'd encourage you to at least try one. Based on my friend group's conversion rate, there's a good chance you'll be joining the Rally revolution too. Here's to a year of better recovery, less soreness, and smarter investments in our health.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The C-Clamp has been in use for thousands of years. It’s one of those dead-simple tools that just works. It’s also one of those tools you tend to collect multiple examples of, in different sizes.Typically, you use a C-Clamp to, uh, clamp stuff together, like two pieces of wood, or to clamp something into place while you work on it (I use them a lot to cut lumber so I can have both hands on the saw, as I am allergic to emergency rooms.) But the C-Clamp is actually a very versatile tool that can be deployed in a number of creative—but useful!—ways. Here are some of my favorite ways to repurpose those old C-Clamps.A carrying handleIf you need to carry something that’s bulky, heavy, and awkward, having some temporary handles always makes the job easier. If you have a few C-Clamps, you’re golden: Just clamp a couple onto whatever you’re transporting and you have instant handles to make the haul a little easier. They can also be used as handles for rolled-up materials, like rugs or mats—just thread the roll through a pair of C-Clamps, tighten them closed, and carry on.A quiet hammerIt’s happened to all of us: You need to drive a nail somewhere, but there’s no room to swing a hammer, or for some reason you’re reluctant to make a lot of banging noise. The solution is your trusty C-Clamp: Just place the clamp over the nail head and tighten. The clamping action will inexorably (and silently) drive that nail into place. This isn’t an efficient way to drive a lot of nails, of course, but in a tight spot, it’s brilliant.An emergency wrench\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nNeed to tighten or loosen a connector, but you don’t have a wrench at hand? Tighten a C-Lamp around the bolt, cuff, or connection point so that it’s gripping tightly, then slowly turn it in the direction you need. Make sure the clamp is tight enough to prevent slippage, and you might want to use something (a handy piece of cloth works) to protect the connection from damage as you work.A cord organizerWhether it’s corralling all those extension and power cords on a workbench or work site, or organizing computer cables on your desk with an industrial vibe, C-Clamps can keep all those wires under control and out of your way in a pinch. Just gather the cords at the edge of the desk or table and clamp them down. This is a perfect temporary solution, as the cords can pass freely through the clamps without risk of damage, and the clamps can be removed when the job is done.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBookendsNeed a couple of bookends to hold stuff in place on a shelf? A pair of C-Clamps attached to the outer edge and clamped in as deep as possible will work. This could even be a permanent design choice if your taste runs toward the rustic or industrial.AnchorsC-Clamps are ideal devices when anchor points are needed, but you don’t want to attach anything permanent that would require fasteners and drilling into a structure. Need a clothesline to dry your laundry when the dryer breaks? Two C-Clamps and some rope or twine are all you need. Need to hang tools, clothes, or anything else? C-Clamps attached to a shelf of any kind, combined with a hook, will work a charm. Need to hold a tablecloth or other covering in place? Nothing clamps stuff down to a horizontal surface better than C-Clamps.Spool holderWhether you’re spooling filament to your 3D-printer or feeding twine or wire to yourself as you work on a project, sliding the spool over a C-Clamp and then clamping it into place gives you a sturdy holder that you can pull from. This means you won’t have to juggle your spool every time you need more slack, and you can easily unclamp and reposition the spool if you’re on the move as you work.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n    \n        \n        New Year’s resolutions are all about improving ourselves, right? The same goes for your best buddy—your dog. While your dog can’t physically tell you what they need to feel their best, there are simple things you can do to help set them up for success. Right now, you can save 50% off your first box of human-grade The Farmer’s Dog pet food, so that’s a great start.

Whatever your reasons, you’re in need of a last-minute gift, and your options are limited. If you're reading this at a time when it's too late for online delivery, and in-person store options are already closed, then all that’s left is the glory of your local 24-hour drug store.If you have access to a major chain like Walgreens or CVS, you could be in surprisingly good shape for this last-minute gift. All it takes is a little ingenuity to level up this gift from \"a protein bar\" to \"a gym bro collection,\" or \"some loose nail polish\" to a \"curated at-home spa day.\"Following this logic, I’ve carefully categorized your gift options into three tiers. The first is for gift-givers willing to shell out a little extra cash in their panic in order to create something somewhat personalized. The second tier includes single-item purchases that are simply passable gift options. The third tier is a warning.Tier one: DIY signature collectionsLike a chef turning baskets of mystery ingredients into a three-course meal on Chopped, this category of gifts is all about your innovation. In these DIY arrangements, the sum is greater than its parts, which should all be available at most chain drug stores. Here are some of our ideas for themed collections, but feel free to customize at your convenience.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nMovie night: Popcorn. Funky popcorn toppings. Candy. Hot chocolate. Fuzzy socks. A little slip of paper with your Netflix login. You can’t go wrong with a cozy movie-night theme.Treat yo’ self: Think spa day materials, like face masks, nail polish, and bath bombs. Throw in a candle to help set the pampering vibe.Health and wellness: Browse around for gummy vitamins, supplements, protein powder, and whatever else catches your eye in the fitness aisle. Be warned: This one can quickly get expensive. The Jetsetter: Pick from the array of travel-sized must-haves, including ear plugs and perhaps even a neck pillow (with a note about how to wear it right). The Techie: Head to the electronics section and go wild with whatever gadgets are available and within your price range. Portable chargers and speakers are quality gifts in their own right. Tier two: It’s the thought that countsThese items aren’t necessarily bad gifts, but many will be easily detected as a last-minute purchase. The success of tier two drug store gifts will come down to the charm of the gift-giver and the chill factor of the recipient.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGift cardsCandlesCosmetic bagsTherapeutic massagerJewelryInsulated mugsCalendars or plannersNotebooksCoffee/tea bundlesWine and a corkscrew (depending on your state’s liquor laws)Picture framesElectronics, like ear buds or portable chargersTier three: “Gifts” that will do more harm than goodHey, buddy.

You need a plan. You need acronyms. One such acronym is RAFT, which will literally keep you afloat in the sea of emails you receive every day. You can combine it with others, like LIFO and 4D to maximize its benefits, but first you need to know what to do with it on its own.What is RAFT email management?RAFT stands for the following: ReadActFileTrash.Easy! With this management system, you take the time to read an email first, then act on it however you need to—if you need to, that is—before either filing it away somewhere or deleting it. That’s basically all there is to it, but it works because it requires you to focus on each individual email and make an assessment right away, so you don’t miss anything.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nLike the one- and two-touch rules, this one does require you to open your emails as they come in. For me, that's the hardest part because it's a habit you need to build. This approach reminds me of a more broadly-applicable productivity technique I use often, which is the two-minute rule. When you think of something or are prompted to deal with it, handle it right away. Again, it's a habit that needs to be built up, but I like this approach for all kinds of productivity needs—and with RAFT, you have a clearly outlined series of next steps after you open it up. How to get the most out of RAFTTo maximize the benefits, you should combine this with another system or two. For instance, combine RAFT with the LIFO—last in, first out—method, which calls for you to answer your most recent emails before older ones. If you do this, you’ll always be acting on the most urgent needs instead of playing endless catch-up with things that you let slip by. If something from the past is truly important, you’ll get a follow-up email and you can RAFT then. Otherwise, stick with your most pressing, recent messages and read them, act on them, and file or trash them after that.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes to the acting part, you can call on the trusty 4D method to help you out. The four Ds are delete, do, delegate, or defer, and they refer to the four things you can do with any email. (Delete here is redundant, since “trash” is part of RAFT, but it’s good to reinforce the notion that useless emails should be nuked.) Either do what the email says or delegate it to someone who can, but keep the process moving swiftly. If you don’t end up forwarding it to someone else, delete it or defer (file) it. The main rule of RAFT is you have to do something with every message, not ignore it. As for the filing component of RAFT, make sure you have a great file system in place in advance. If you use Gmail, consider using labels as a more organized archive system, to make whatever you choose to file away more easily accessible. You can label these mini-archives by date, by project, or by whatever makes sense for your retrieval, but be consistent about it so you’re not just banishing all your dealt-with messages to an email limbo. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When that happens, you can might yourself getting distracted and missing important messages—at least, that's what happens to me, unless I have some kind of plan in place.There are a few different approaches you can consider to prevent this, but the \"OHIO\" technique is the one to try if you need extra help being decisive—though it's important to note that while it can ease your decision paralysis, it does have a few limitations worth considering. What is the OHIO method of time management?OHIO is an acronym for “Only Handle It Once” and you'll hear it crop up in a variety of productivity-based conversations, like ones around tidying up. Proponents say it helps you avoid unnecessary dawdling, delays, and indecision, as it calls for you to handle any task, email, message, or assignment just one time. It's definitely a habit you need to build up to, but it's one that pays off the longer you work at it.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nYou can broadly apply it to what you’re working by assessing your entire inbox, to-do list, or other group of tasks all at once. Prioritize the tasks in order of importance using a system like the Eisenhower Matrix or ABC method. (If the workload isn’t too complex, feel free to prioritize them quickly on your own without a fancy system, but I'm a big fan of customizing hyper-specific productivity techniques to meet my needs.) Then take immediate action on each, starting from the top. Either delete them, delegate them, do what they say, or defer them, using the 4D method.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe OHIO method works great for emails, too, but it can suck you into time-wasting if you’re not careful. Only handling each email once is a solid way not to spend too much time on it, but you have to plan what you’re going to do. Otherwise, you may end up clicking every new email that comes in and trying to manage it in real time.Emails are harder to prioritize than a to-do list, so you may struggle to determine which one you should jump on first. Instead of implementing the OHIO method in the moment every moment, set aside time every morning and afternoon to go through your messages and, of course, only handle them once. (You can use time boxing and time blocking to make sure you do this at the same time every day, plus a 3-3-3 to-do list to make sure you have time to prioritize the task.) Try a half hour at the start of your workday, a half hour after lunch, and 15 minutes just before clocking out. If you base your approach on time, rather than a prioritized list, you’ll still be able to open each message and handle it, but won’t be swamped by having to do that every time you get a new alert. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network. As GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution. Check your IP address for suspicious activityTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure). \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps. As BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: verona studio - Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        There are a lot of methods to try in the never-ending quest for a way to sort through and slim down our bulging inboxes. They're different enough that there's certainly one out there that matches or comes close to matching your exact needs, but they do all have one thing in common: They rely on the chronology of when each email came in. Let’s try turning that approach on its head, and instead, sort by sender to weed through the mess.Why you should sort your inbox by senderWhen purging your messages, you probably have an organizational system you follow, like the 4Ds. You go through and decide what gets deleted, done, delegated, or deferred—but there’s not much pattern recognition if you’re just starting at the top and working your way down. Every day's demands or outreach might look different depending on what you have going on at that time. Sorting your inbox by sender instead of most recent helps you see whose (or what) messages you receive most. If it’s a newsletter or mailing list, you can delete them all in one go, but if it’s a specific person at work, you might get a signal that they tend to need a response from you. From there, you can prioritize their emails, maybe adding them as a favorite contact or paying special attention for new correspondence from them, since you know their messages are more consequential than others. Even if you're using the one- or two-touch methods, which call on you to open every single email the moment you get it, this can be helpful because you'll feel a sense of urgency around specific senders once you identify the patterns. So instead of deleting or delegating emails one by one, you can try nuking or dealing with entire batches from certain senders to make the sorting process faster. How to sort by sender in GmailIn Gmail, if you’ve already found a message from the person or entity whose emails you want to bundle up, you can right-click it from your inbox and hit “find emails from.” This brings you to an inbox only of messages from that sender. You can also access this inbox by typing “from:[their email address]” in the search bar, or clicking the advanced search button  and entering their name into the “from” field.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, you can’t sort your entire Gmail inbox by sender, and instead can only make bundles sender by sender, but it still helps with batching them up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sort by sender in OutlookOutlook is better than Gmail for this method. In fact, it allows you to sort your entire inbox not only by sender, but by other recipients, size, and more.At the top of the inbox, hit “Filter,” then “Sort by.” Depending on what version you’re running, you may have to go into the “View” tab and hit “From” in the Arrangement group. The emails will line up in your inbox by sender, making them easy to bundle and delete.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.  Lookalike domains contain malicious contentThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes. In some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware. Infoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to avoid parked domain scamsOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site. I've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        You can do a lot with Android Auto, but what you can't do is install a web browser—at least not with the default, out-of-the-box configuration. It is actually possible to get a window on to the web with a little bit of tweaking, and the help of the open source AA Browser built especially for Android Auto.Getting a web browser up on your car dashboard may not seem like much of an improvement over browsing on your phone screen, but it also enables another feature on your vehicle's display: video playback. Through AA Browser you can get at pretty much any streaming site you want and load up some video.Some serious safety warnings are required here, though. You should only load up videos on your car's Android Auto screen when you're parked, stationary, and not going anywhere. Watching anything on the move—whether it's on your phone or on your vehicle dashboard—not only risks your life, it risks the lives of everyone else on the road with you.In fact, AA Browser will disable itself while your vehicle is moving, but it's worth giving out the warning in any case, for this and any other app. With that out of the way, here's how you can load up a web browser on Android Auto, and make your parked-up time inside your car more entertaining.Browser setup and installationLike Android as a whole, Android Auto has a developer mode that gives you access to a selection of extra settings. From Settings on Android, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixels) or just Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy phones). Scroll down to the bottom of the screen, tap Version, then tap Version and permission info seven times.You should then see a pop-up asking you if you're sure you want to enable developer settings for Android Auto, so tap OK to confirm. You then need to open up the AAAD (Android Auto Apps Downloader) app APK in your phone's browser, tapping through the security warnings about running non-Play Store apps on your device if they show up.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            AAAD will give you access to the AA Browser.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAAAD gives you access to a selection of Android Auto apps that haven't been specifically approved by Google, including AA Browser. Tap through the various introduction screens, give the app the permissions that it needs to install other apps, and then find AA Browser in the list of available apps. Tap Install and then tap through the confirmation pop-ups to get the app on your phone.You'll be asked if you want to open AA Browser straight away: You can use it as a normal web browser on your phone, though there's not really much to look at. It's designed to be used primarily on your Android Auto screen, and it should now show up as an available app when your phone is connected to your vehicle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsing AA Browser in your carProvided you're safely stopped in your vehicle, you can launch AA Browser from the main apps list on the Android Auto interface (you may also get a prompt to launch it the first time you connect, after installing the app). You get taken to the Google Search homepage to begin with, and from there you can go anywhere you like.As with any other Android Auto app, if you tap inside an input field, you'll see a keyboard pop up on screen that you can use to enter web addresses and login credentials, and you can use the touchscreen to navigate around. To get to the URL address bar, tap anywhere on screen, then tap the blue arrow in the lower left corner.\n    \n            \n            Entering and editing URLs in AA Browser.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe next screen also gives you options for going back through your browser history and accessing your bookmarks—a handy way of making sure you can jump back to the sites you need without having to tap our their URLs every time. There's also the option to request the desktop versions of sites rather than the mobile versions.While certain sites don't seem to like the AA Browser, most of the pages I've visited work fine on Android Auto. To quit the browser, you can either tap the Exit button in the top right corner (if it's visible), or swipe up or down from the top or bottom edges of the Android Auto screen to go back to your other apps.\n            ",

Despite the conference not kicking off until Tuesday, the company shared details around its upcoming devices that are likely to launch this spring. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Petkit advertises all three pet devices as \"AI-powered,\" and while that's been a go-to gimmick for companies since 2023, there are some unique applications here—assuming the devices actually do what Petkit says they do. Purobot Crystal Duo litterboxPetkit says the Purobot Crystal Duo is the first AI-powered open-top litter box, and that the Purobot uses the tech for health detection. This device has an 720p AI-powered camera that monitors your cat's stools as well as their behavior when visiting the litter box. The Purobot looks at things like stool consistency and urine pH, as well as \"vocalizations,\" and noting all in the Petkit app. You can take any of those findings to your vet if you have concerns. Petkit says the Purobot uses crystal litter to absorb urine and dehydrate waste to manage odors. The company claims users can wait 30 days before needing to scoop the contents of the litter box, which also comes with disposable trays. The company plans to launch Purobot in July, on both Amazon as well as Petkit's official site. Eversweet Ultra water dispenser Petkit's new water dispenser also uses an AI-powered camera to track health habits, only this time through your pet's \"hydration habits.\" The device ships with a 1080p camera with a 140-degree wide-angle view that tracks your pet as they drink, even in the dark. The Eversweet supports facial recognition for multiple pets, which, in theory, allows it to track the habits of specific pets drinking from the same device.The dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, which Petkit claims supports two full weeks of drinking water for one pet. The device detects when the water is low, and refills the bowl when needed, passing through a \"antibacterial filter cube\" to prevent bacterial growth. Any \"waste\" water is not recirculated through the dispenser, and is instead separated, so pets should always have fresh water while the reservoir is full.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nPetkit says the Eversweet Ultra may launch in April, though that's only an estimate. It, too, will be available on both Amazon, as well as Petkit's official site.  Perhaps Petkit's biggest announcement is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic feeder that works with wet food. This feeder can portion out fresh food for cats and dogs on a custom schedule, while tracking your pet's eating habits to build \"eating insights.\" Those insights are partially informed by the feeder's built-in 1080p AI-powered camera, with a 140-degree wide-angle view. It also supports facial recognition for multiple pets.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPetkit says the Yumshare Daily Feast supports up to seven days of fully automated wet meals—the keyword being \"automated.\" The machine opens each food pack itself, and each portion is \"kept within its freshness window.\" That means if your pet doesn't finish its meal, the device will take away the leftovers, and uses ultraviolet light (specifically UVC) to sanitize before delivering the next portion.  Petkit estimates it will release the Yumshare Daily Feast in April, both on Amazon as well as Petkit's official website. As with any new products, we'll have to wait until reviewers can perform hands-on testing before deciding whether these devices can actually achieve what they claim to. However, if Petkit's products are up to snuff, they could offer pet owners some legitimate benefits. The wet feeder really could be great for anyone who needs to leave their cat for long periods of time. The Purobot and Eversweet could also provide some essential health insights ahead of a vet visit: If you're seeing reports that your cat is crying while using the litter box, or isn't drinking as much water as they usually do, you could get ahead of a health problem by notifying your vet early.   \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n    We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n            Credit: Clicks\n                            \n            \n                Key Takeaways\n                                            The Clicks Communicator is bringing back a Blackberry style form factor for the modern age.\n                                            It's got a full QWERTY keyboard and can be used standalone or as a companion to another phone.\n                                            There's also a power bank with a sliding keyboard, for those who don't want a whole secondary device.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Clicks, the company behind those physical keyboard cases for your smartphone, has announced a new device, but it'll look pretty familiar to anyone who's used a Blackberry before. It's called the Clicks Communicator, and it's a pocketable little handset that's perfect for anyone who misses having physical buttons on their phone. It comes with a full, old-school style QWERTY keyboard and runs Android 16, and while you can pump it full of apps and use it standalone, Clicks says it expects many of its customers will prefer to use it as a minimalistic companion to a primary smartphone. In that way, this device is designed to be your secondary smartphone, where you only load it with the apps you need at a moments notice and use it to quickly reply to your messages, emails, and other important notifications.The Clicks Communicator is a modern Blackberry\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Clicks\n                    \n    \nOne of the headlining features of the Clicks Communicator is the Signal LED, which is a notification light around the side button. You can set it to light up with a different color based on who's pinged you or which apps are sending you notifications, so you can know what needs your attention first without having to scroll through a long series of notification boxes. For instance, you could set up a green LED for notifications from people you care about, and use other colors for different apps. I'm not entirely sure how this'll play out in practice, because I do worry that I'll forget which color is for what after a point. Fortunately, Clicks says you can also turn off the Signal LED if it's not useful for you (and yes, there will still be traditional notification boxes if you need them).As for the core experience, in line with its design philosophy, the company has chosen not to show you an app grid when you go to the home screen. In collaboration with Niagara Launcher, Click has instead built a messaging hub, which shows you all your pending alerts on the home screen, grouped by app. You can use the keyboard to triage these messages or to reply to individual chats, the company says.There's also a lot of emphasis on the keyboard, as is expected from a company that went viral by launching a physical keyboard case for touchscreen phones. Clicks says the keys on the Communicator are bigger and better than those on its keyboard case. There's a red Clicks key on the keypad, which you can use to launch custom shortcuts. The Spacebar has a built-in fingerprint sensor, which could be handy for unlocking the phone quickly. The keypad is touch-sensitive, which means that you can slide your fingers over it to scroll through messages. And before you ask, yes, it also has a 4.03-inch OLED touchscreen display for those of us who like scrolling on a smoother surface.Some of you may also be pleased to know that the Clicks Communicator has a 3.5mm headphone jack and that it supports microSD cards for storage expansion. It ships with 256GB storage and you can add a microSD card with up to 2TB of capacity. The device runs Android 16, supports Qi2 wireless charging, has a USB-C port, and has a 50-MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, alongside a 24-MP front camera. It's powered by a 4nm MediaTek chip that has 5G support. It's a dual-SIM phone with one physical SIM slot and an eSIM, so you could use it on its own instead of as the \"complementary product\" its pitched as, but taking calls or using certain apps could be tricky on such a small device.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nIf you want a Clicks Communicator, you can reserve one now for $399 + $30 for shipping and duties. The launch price is expected to be $499, which means that pre-orders get a $100 discount. The device also has swappable back covers, and the company is offering two back covers for free with pre-orders.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA Magsafe power bank with a sliding keyboard\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Clicks\n                    \n    \nFor everyone that just wants to add physical keys to their existing phone, Clicks has also launched a magnetic wireless power bank with a built-in sliding physical keyboard. This is one of the more quirky products I've seen from this year's pre-CES announcements, but it could make for a great middle ground for everyone who doesn't want the Communicator. I wasn't a big fan of wired power banks back in the day, but the advent of magnetic wireless charging has changed that, and now I'm itching to slap one onto my iPhone. Throwing a slide-out Bluetooth keyboard into the mix just sweetens the pot, even if it is a bit of a heavy package overall, at 180g. And because of that wireless Bluetooth connection, you can also use the keyboard with your phone, tablet, TV, or gaming console, if you like. The charger doesn't need to be physically attached to a device for its keyboard to work with it, and the device as a whole works with both Apple and Android.There is a downside, though. The Clicks Power Keyboard has a 2,150mAh battery, and it only supports 5W Qi wireless charging. That's a very slow charger by today's standards, but the good news is that your smartphone is less likely to overheat with those charging speeds. It's priced at $80 for pre-orders and is expected to start shipping this Spring.For a comparison, you could get an Anker wireless power bank for around $55. This one weighs 4.3oz (120g), offers faster 15W charging, and has a higher battery capacity (5,000mAh). You don't get a physical keyboard with most power banks in the market, so Clicks is banking on that to power sales of its Power Keyboard.\n            \n    ",

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Toss in the fact that those plans to authenticate real users have now been replaced by a paid verification scheme, and it's clear the site is still figuring out how to deal with fake users. The most recent plan? Put a bunch of your personal information in an \"About this account\" section on your profile page.In an X post this week, X head of product Nikita Bier said that starting next week, the social media site will begin \"experimenting with displaying new information on profiles.\" This includes which country a user is based in, when they joined the site, how many times they've changed their username, and how they're accessing the site (via desktop or via the app, for instance).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe idea, Bier says, is that checking this information will allow users to \"to verify [an account's] authenticity.\" For instance, if you're being spammed with a bunch of suspicious followers, and they all seem to be new accounts from the same region, you might be able to infer that you're being targeted by some kind of coordinated spam attack.At the same time, however, the new section comes with privacy concerns. One user, for instance, asked Bier if X accounts will be able to opt out of having the country they're based in displayed for all to see. Another, seemingly in favor of the new system, asked if the page could include information about which device a user is posting from, to which Bier replied that the team is \"experimenting with various device details for users to form judgments on authenticity.\" Yikes.While none of that is quite as aggressive as just posting your address, it still peels back the curtain a bit more than I'd like, and leaves room for others to make judgments about you based on geography, or if Bier follows through on that second point, your model of phone.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLuckily, the feature isn't guaranteed to make it live for everyone quite yet. Bier says that the initial test will begin with \"a handful of X team members to get feedback.\" And to his credit, he has been responsive in replies to his post, acknowledging that in \"countries where speech can have penalties, we should substitute country for region.\"If the new section rubs you the wrong way, now's the time to speak up about it. If, however, it does make its way towards your profile one day, there is a silver lining. Bier says that should you not want certain information made public on your profile, \"There will be privacy toggles.\" However, if a user configures them, he says \"that will likely be highlighted on their profile.\"For my own two cents, I have essentially moved on from X at this point, and bots have been a big reason why. Still, I'm not sure encouraging users to judge each other based on where they're located (or even username changes, which are common during spooky season) is the right move. While some countries are more associated with inauthentic accounts than others, real users live everywhere, and implying that readers should dismiss others based simply on where they are runs the risk of adding more toxicity to the pile. Take this bizarre reply to Bier's announcement, which implies that...Canada?...is full of trolls.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you’re fairly acquainted with the core concepts, you can force active recall by using flashcards to review, or enhance your grasp of a topic by teaching it to someone else, for instance. But what about when you’re first encountering a new piece of information and you have no real context for it? A lot of reading techniques ask you to come up with questions or hypotheses before you even start reading, but that’s not easy when you don’t have much familiarity with your subject at all. In these cases, the REAP method can help. It’s a technique that directs you to read first, and save the deeper work for later. Here’s how it works.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhat is the REAP method?REAP is an acronym that stands for “read, encode, annotate, and ponder.” Like methods such as SQ3R or KWL, it asks you to approach each new passage with a strategic plan. But unlike those techniques, you don’t have to know anything about your subject going into a reading session. Instead of skimming the chapter, coming up with ideas about what you think it will be about and what you want to get out of it, and relying on what you already know before you start, you acknowledge that you don’t know much about the subject at all, and set out to learn more about it, and then think more about it to figure out what parts are most essential before committing it to memory.Essentially, it's a way of reading something while giving yourself the grace to not \"get it\" right away, as well as the space to learn it. Just by acknowledging you're feeling adrift, you can start to work on ways to understand as much as you can. How does REAP work?Here are the basic elements of the REAP method:Read the materialEncode the information in your own wordsAnnotate by jotting down main ideasPonder what you've gone overUsing the REAP method, you first read the passage, chapter, or section of text on your own. Don’t think too hard here; the goal of a reading-first approach is not to read overly critically, but to absorb the information as a whole. Then you encode the information by putting it in your own words. You can do this by writing a quick, paragraph-long summary in your notes or describing it out loud to someone else. You can try blurting, or writing down everything you can remember without referencing your materials, but don't worry if you forget things; you're still in the middle of the REAP process.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNext, annotate the text by writing down only the main ideas—whether in the form of keywords, pieces of data, quotes, or standout elements of the introduction or conclusion. If you've already \"blurted,\" you can use this part to refine and revise that, contrasting what you wrote down with the source material, then condensing it to include only the key parts.When it’s time to ponder, review the text, your summary, and your high-level notes as you develop additional research questions sparked by what you’ve read. This is when you can begin to make connections between the information and real-world applications. It’s only at this point that you lean on critical reading and reflection: Compare your encoding and annotation with the original text and consider whether you accurately identified the most critical themes and overall messages in your rewriting.In a sense, this is the reverse of methods like the aforementioned SQ3R or KWL. With those methods, you write down your questions before you start, then go hunting through the material for the answers. With REAP, since you don't have the context or knowledge to formulate questions, you have to go gather that before you can start pondering. Which of these reading techniques you use ultimately depends on how much you know going in.The REAP approach is a good one to start with before moving on to something more granular, like that SQ3R method. It lets you familiarize yourself with the full body of text instead of immediately focusing on the nitty-gritty of subheadings and tables. This helps you grasp the overarching meaning before you dive into the weeds. For maximum retention, next try going back through the text and employing a critical reading technique like THIEVES to extract every relevant detail.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

In the end, it just depends on my mood. Good news for people like me: Tonal is rolling out reformer-style Pilates with its new update. If you have the at-home weight training device or are considering getting one, this could be major for you. Even if you're not someone who wakes up on a Saturday morning excited to go trade $65 for 45 minutes on the reformer—or you've never even tried Pilates at all—this is nice because it can allow you to give it a whirl from the comfort of your home, using the same device you use for more traditional strength training. Led by yoga and Pilates instructor Kristin McGee, the classes are broken down by experience level and, like all Tonal workouts, customized to your strength. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow Tonal's Pilates classes feelI got to test out the new Pilates offering last week, which was exciting because I don't have a Tonal machine (yet, since I'm planning to get one) but also daunting because, well, I don't have a Tonal machine. I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew, broadly, that these are digital devices you stick to your wall, calibrate, and work out with basically like you would with your gym's cable machine. They use magnetic resistance to increase and decrease the weight that you're pulling on. \nFirst, I did a few regular lifting exercises so the machine could determine how strong I am. Any user will do these same four exercises to get a baseline. From then on, the machine will set up all weights for all exercises to align with what that person can do, progressively increasing the weight over time as the user gets stronger. Then it was Pilates time. The big difference between the new Pilates offerings and the traditional strength training on Tonal is the same difference you find when you compare using a cable machine to using a reformer: With the Pilates moves, the resistance gets harder as you push or pull, whether because of the springs on the reformer or the settings on the Tonal. I did some leg circles, some hundreds, and a handful of other standard Pilates moves—and besides the fact I was laying flat on the floor and interacting with a big digital machine, it did feel pretty similar to using a reformer. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Tonal Pilates specsThis program won't be out officially for Tonal users until Nov. 17, but you can order your loop attachments now. Made in partnership with Pilates Loops, they cost $100 and are similar to the straps you get on a standard reformer. There's a long loop, a short loop, and a knot you can grab farther down, depending on the exercise you're doing and how intense you want it to be. Beyond the loops, no further equipment upgrade is necessary—software updates will hit Tonal 1 and Tonal 2 machines in November. The Pilates upgrade will work with the digital weight technology that comes along in all the equipment and will go up to 10 resistance levels. The machine makes small adjustments as you work through the moves, which are presented and demonstrated by McGee, so if you're having a hard time or something is too easy, the adjustments are automatic. Tonal did already offer mat Pilates classes and while I love those, they're not quite the same as fighting against a machine custom-built for the struggle, which is why I still find myself trekking to a studio a few times a week even though I have access to mat Pilates classes through YouTube, Peloton, and my gym. The addition of this programming adds a more in-depth option for anyone looking for a workout that's easy on the joints, engages the core, and boosts mobility and balance. A Tonal 2 costs $4,295 and a monthly membership runs you $60. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the weekend, multiple Reddit users complained that their Pixel 10 phones, which only just hit the market in August, were already facing severe slowdowns and frequent crashes while trying to load apps. Worse yet, the problem seemed to persist across all apps and models of the phone, leaving users with little they could actually do on their new devices. \"If an app does open and load it won't let me touch anything and it crashes,\" user cdriese said, with a number of others sharing a similar sentiment.The unfortunate news took me as a bit of a surprise, since I experienced no such issues while reviewing the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro at launch, both of which I quite liked. But the problem, it seems, only popped up recently. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMultiple users across Reddit pointed to October 10's Google Play Services update as the culprit here, with some saying that uninstalling the update fixed the problem for them. \"My running theory is that the October play services update is clashing with the September Android OS update in some way,\" said user PuzzleHeadedSquid, adding that they have had no crashes since uninstalling the Play Services update. Sure enough, when I loaded my phone with both the September Android OS update and the initial October play services updates installed, I also started to have issues.In a way, though, that's still a relief. Your new hardware isn't broken already—but uninstalling the new Play Services update introduces its own headaches. Luckily, as of this morning, there's another solution, and it's pretty simple.If you're experiencing crashing apps on your Pixel 10, here's what you can do.The official fixRandom Reddit users weren't the only folks experiencing this problem. Android Police founder Artem Russakovskii also called out the problem in an October 12 X post, saying his Pixel 10 Pro XL had been \"kneecapped\" by it.\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nLuckily, as a member of the press, he had a bit more resources at his disposal for fixing this bug than the average Redditor. Over the course of the weekend, Russakovskii quickly got in touch with his contacts at Google, who he says scrambled multiple teams to address the issue and has since issued a server-side fix.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTheoretically, that means a simple restart should bring your phone back to normal, although if the problem persists, you'll also want to make sure you're running the most recent Google Play services build (which you can check under Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details), then do another restart.It's a pretty quick turnaround on a fix, and doesn't require much on your part, but if you've temporarily shelved your Pixel, it's worth booting it back up again to see if you're still having issues.The unofficial fixThat said, it's possible Google's engineers still might have missed something. If you still find yourself having issues loading apps, you can use the community method of uninstalling the October Play Services update instead. This will log you out of your Google accounts, however, and won't include Google's official fix, so I'd only recommend it in an emergency.That said, if you're at the point of pulling your hair out, you can navigate to Settings > Apps > Google Play services > App details and tap \"Remove updates\" to start the process. Just be sure to have your Google passwords (or passkeys!) memorized first.First, though, try hitting the \"Update\" button next to it instead, then restarting your phone. That's what I did, after initially running my testing without this morning's update, and my apps are now as snappy as ever.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The app recently switched ownership from the Chinese-based ByteDance to the new \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture,\" which, as the name implies, is a majority American-owned business entity. Any changing of the guard comes with the risk for disruptions and issues, but it seems TikTok's problems have gone beyond the usual rocky transition. First, the app itself went down, which the company attributed to a power outage at a data center. Then, users accused the platform of updating its terms of service with aggressive new tracking, blocking certain content types, and \"shadowbanning\" new posts from some users. It's still not clear exactly what's going on here, but users aren't waiting around for more explanation. In fact, many have made up their minds already, and believe the app is actively suppressing content, neutering algorithms, and invading privacy in a way it didn't under ByteDance. While there are other, popular social media platforms to jump to, many apparently have flocked to a relatively new one: UpScrolled. As of this article, it's now the second most popular free app on the iOS App Store, reminding me of when X users ran to Bluesky. UpScrolled, created by Issam Hijazi, is a social media platform that launched this past June. According to the company's \"About\" page, UpScrolled's mission is to allow all users to share their views without risk of bias, shadowbanning, or \"unfair\" algorithms. The company asserts it does not push agendas, and ensures that \"every post has a fair chance to be seen.\" If you believe TikTok's algorithm is now biased against your views, I could see how that pitch sounds enticing. \nThe company says it only restricts content that violates their guidelines. That means illegal activities, hate speech, bullying and harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted content, or anything \"intended to cause harm.\" UpScrolled will also never ban you without your knowledge. If the platform removes your videos or your account, it says it'll let you know why. One big difference between UpScrolled and other social media platforms is its algorithm. The app splits feeds into two: There's the Following Feed, which lists posts entirely in chronological order. The first posts are the newest from your followers, and you scroll through previous posts. If you want to find new posts from accounts you don't follow, you can use the Discover Feed. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, the Discover Feed does not employ some aggressive, personalized algorithm. Instead, it's based on likes, comments, and reshares. Popular posts from across the platform are shared with you  What I especially appreciate is UpScrolled's approach to data collection, in that they largely don't do it. The company says it doesn't sell user data to third-parties for marketing, tracking, or for profit. The only times they'll hand over user data is when compelled by law. That's in sharp contrast to many social media platforms, which seem to collect as much of your data as possible.I haven't spent much time with the app yet, though I did create an account this morning to see what the hullabaloo was all about. I don't recognize any of the users the app suggests I follow, which means I'll likely need to dig through the content types if I want to find accounts to start following. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Discover Feed is a mix of content types, but is heavy with content surrounding the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, many users are choosing the platform as a space for pro-Palestinian content, in response to allegations that mainstream social media apps censor these types of posts. That said, the app advertises a host of different content types to follow, including sports, news, games, film, music, tech, and travel. As you might expect, some of the posts here are simply ripped from TikTok, which is a common practice I see on social media platforms that, well, aren't TikTok. Despite the current controversy, it's clear which platform still has the largest user share at this time, by a long shot. But it's not all short-form videos. The app also includes plenty of posts of static images as well, which reminds me more of Instagram than TikTok. Still, it seems former TikTok users don't care that this isn't a one-to-one replica of the TikTok formula, and care more about sending a message to the app they once loved being addicted to. I'm not sure my limited journey with UpScrolled this morning will keep me hooked, but it's an interesting take on a social media platform. We'll just need to see if the growth will continue, or if this is just a momentary blip before people return to TikTok. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That’s a steep cut from Amazon’s current $369 listing, and you’re still getting a full one-year manufacturer warranty. Shipping is free for Prime members, and the deal is live for three more days (or until it sells out). PCMag gave it an “outstanding” rating in its review, highlighting how stable and clean the footage looks. Lifehacker’s Stephen Johnson also called it one of his favorite products, largely because it works without much effort.In use, the Hero12 Black sticks closely to what GoPro has always done well. It’s compact, tough, and easy to mount almost anywhere. Video tops out at 5.3K at 60 frames per second, which gives you noticeably more detail than 4K and extra room to crop without wrecking the quality. The stabilization, thanks to GoPro’s HyperSmooth stabilization, is strong enough that handheld clips often look like they were shot on a gimbal. And there are front and rear screens for easy framing—helpful whether you’re vlogging or filming the view ahead. The 8:7 shooting mode of the Hero12 Black is especially useful if you’re creating content for multiple platforms. You can shoot once and crop for vertical reels or horizontal YouTube clips without needing separate takes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt is also waterproof to 33 feet without a case, which covers swimming, snorkeling, rain, and most casual water use. That said, GoPro removed the built-in GPS on this model. That means no automatic speed or route overlays out of the box. The upside is slightly better battery life, though it still won’t last a full day of continuous recording. Carrying a spare battery will be the smarter move if you’re filming long sessions. Storage is via microSD, and you get Bluetooth, wifi, and USB-C for easy transfers. This isn’t the right camera for someone looking for automatic tracking or cinematic depth of field, but if your priorities are portability, versatility, and durability, it still holds up well. It’s a great tool for creators, travelers, and anyone who wants to capture fast-moving moments without worrying about breaking the gear.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's a powerhouse of a browser that is more widely used than any other.In the 18 years since its release, Chrome has changed a lot: A host of features have been added and taken away down the years, and it's very possible that you don't know everything that Chrome can do, even if you use it every day. Here are my favorite hacks for Chrome, covering everything from casting tabs to playing audio and video.Change the look and feel of Google ChromeIf you've always stuck with the 'out of the box' Chrome aesthetic, you might not be aware that it's relatively simple to change up the theme of the browser—which covers the colors of menus and tabs, as well as what you see on the new tab page. To see the available options, open up a new tab, then click the Customize Chrome button (lower right).You can apply any of the color themes just by clicking on them, or set up your own colors by clicking the color picker (the little pipette icon). For a more significant visual overhaul, click Change theme: You'll then see a range of options created and curated by Google. Click Chrome Web Store to see more official and third-party themes you can install.Claw back some RAM from Chrome\n    \n            \n            Activate Memory Saver for smoother performance.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's fair to say Chrome doesn't have the best reputation for efficient RAM usage, but you can get some of it back. In any tab, click the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Performance, and activate the Memory Saver option. As Google explains, this will put tabs you've not used in a while in an inactive state, and recover some RAM from them.Put your tabs up on a big screenIt's not a Chrome feature that gets much attention, but you can cast tabs wireless to a big screen via Google TV or Chromecast devices. It's useful for everything from music streaming to slide presentations, though the latency is usually too high for video playback (and bear in mind that YouTube, for example, has its own casting button for this).With a tab open in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then choose Cast, save and share > Cast. You'll then be asked to choose the device to cast to (which must be on the same wifi network of course). Via the Sources button, you can choose to cast just the tab you're in, or your entire Windows or macOS desktop, including Google Chrome.Switch up your search engine\n    \n            \n            Chrome can use whatever search engine you tell it to.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJust because you use Google Chrome doesn't mean you have to use Google Search—maybe you want to switch to a privacy-first alternative, like DuckDuckGo. To set up search engines in Chrome and change the default one, click the three dots in the top right corner of any tab, then choose Settings, and open the Search engine page.Use the Add button to add new search engines, the pencil icons on the right to edit their details, and the three dots on the right to set which one is used by default (when you type some search terms into the Chrome address bar). Each search engine can also have a shortcut: Type the shortcut into the address bar to run a search using that specific site.Group your tabs togetherTab grouping can make it much easier to manage the myriad tabs you've got open in every single session—these groups can be moved and closed and saved all together, so you could set up different groups for different research projects, for example, or for different tasks in the browser (maybe one for work-related browsing and another for shopping).The easiest way to get started with tab groups in Chrome is to right click on a tab header and pick Add tab to new group from the pop-up menu. Give your tab a name and color, and if you then right-click on other tab headers, you'll be able to add them to the group (or create a new one). Right-click on the headers of grouped tabs to access further options.Switch between user profiles\n    \n            \n            Add a new profile to separate your browsing activities.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nUser profiles are a hugely powerful Chrome capability that more people should know about: It lets you split your browsing into work and personal categories, for example, (and separate Google accounts, if needed). It means that logins, browsing history, and all the other data that gets stored in Chrome don't all get lumped together in one place.So, you could use your work profile for the day, and then switch to your personal profile at night—making it easier to access your Netflix login and Amazon shopping history, for example. To get started with profiles, click your current profile avatar (in the top right corner, next to the three dots), then choose Add Chrome profile from the menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEdit webpages with TampermonkeyIf you're prepared to invest some time and effort into your Chrome hacking, give the Tampermonkey extension a look (it's actually available for several browsers, not just Chrome). The tool lets you inject your own custom code to modify the websites you're looking at, so you can alter the appearance or even the functionality of pages.You could remove distractions from a page, for example, add your own keyboard shortcuts for navigation, or insert new buttons for sharing links on social media. We don't have the space for a full tutorial here, but if you head to the Tampermonkey website you'll find a wealth of help to get you started, plus some links to user script repositories on the web.Install web apps in Windows or macOS\n    \n            \n            Spotify's web app as a desktop app.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are plenty of powerful web apps you can get at through Chrome—Slack, Gmail, Spotify—and Google's browser lets you set these up as if they were desktop apps in Windows or macOS. You can get a shortcut straight to the app on the Windows taskbar or macOS dock, and when you launch it, it appears in its own distinct desktop window.With the web app open in Chrome, click the three dots (top right), then choose Cast, save and share > Install page as app. You'll then be asked to give your new app a name, and click Install to confirm. The app launches right away, and you can then organize it into your Windows or macOS system as you want (by pinning it to the taskbar, for example).Run a check for safety and privacyChrome comes with a built-in Safety Check that runs an audit on passwords, security updates, third-party extensions, and more. You can find the Safety Check screen by clicking the three dots to the top right of any tab, then choosing Settings > Privacy and security: As well as running the check, you can follow the recommended actions.\n    \n            \n            Chrome can quickly open files like PDFs.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGoogle Chrome can handle more than webpages: It's also able to open up PDF documents, and image, video, and audio files saved in common formats (like MP3 or MOV). Just drag a file into an empty tab to open it, or associate the file type with Chrome in Windows or macOS (which means it'll automatically open in the browser when you double-click on it).Chrome isn't the most advanced PDF editor or video player you're ever going to see, but it's a quick and easy way of opening up local files without having to launch an entirely separate program each time. You could use this alongside the Split View feature, for example, to watch a video stored on your system while making notes in Google Docs.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

According to the settlement website, class payment distribution began on Jan. 23, and many users on Reddit report that funds have landed in their bank and payment apps over the last several days. If you see a deposit from \"Lopez Voice Assistant\" or some variation, it's not a scam. The settlement allowed class members to opt for payment via direct deposit (ACH) as well as electronic or paper check, which will be delivered through email or regular mail, respectively. Some class members are reporting that they received their funds via a different method than they expected, so if you submitted a claim, keep an eye on your transactions as well as your mailboxes to confirm receipt. Note that payouts are being distributed in batches and may take a few days to arrive. \nWhat is the Apple Siri settlement? Last year, Apple agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over privacy concerns with Siri-enabled devices. Users whose devices may have activated and recorded conversations without their knowledge were able to claim compensation. Initially, the settlement was set to pay out $20 per device—iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV were all eligible—for up to five devices per individual claimant. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, due to the final class size, the payout came to just $8.02 per device up to a maximum of $40.10. If you have questions about the settlement and want to speak with an administrator, you can call 888-981-4106 and select option 0 on the main menu.

The platform is speedy, simple, and supports just about every streaming app out there.If you've got a Roku or two in your life, you may not be using it to its full potential. These tips, hacks, and hidden features should help you go beyond the basic business of launching your streaming apps and get more out of your hardware, whether you've just unboxed your first Roku device, or you've been using one for years.Set up PIN protection to protect your RokuIf you've got young kids or nosy housemates living with you, you can lock certain parts of the Roku experience (including making purchases and adding new channels) behind a PIN number. This is actually done through your Roku account page on the web: Click PIN/parental controls on the left, and you can set a new PIN or change an existing one.Change the look and feel of your Roku with a new themeYou don't have to settle for the standard Roku interface visuals—you can easily switch to a different theme (which basically means a different wallpaper and screensaver). From Settings on your device, choose Themes to see alternatives provided by Roku and other people in the Roku community. You can always pick Restore default theme to go back to the original look.Enable captions on replayYou might not want closed captions on all the time, but you can have them enabled whenever you skip backward. From the home screen, pick Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode > On replay to enable this. Note that the streaming app you're using needs to support the feature as well, so it may not work everywhere.Put your most-watched apps up topThis is a simple and effective one that you might not have got around to doing: You can organize the apps on the home screen so your most-used are nearer the top and easier to get to. Select any tile on the home screen, press the star button on your remote to bring up the context menu, and you'll see the Move app and Move app to top options.Make use of Guest Mode when you have company\n    \n            \n            Roku devices come with a Guest Mode included.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's great having guests—but don't let them mess up your recommendations and viewing progress. You can put your Roku device into Guest Mode by opening Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Guest Mode > Enter Guest Mode. You'll be signed out of all your apps, and the Roku device will restart ready for someone else to use it.Send your photos to your Roku to view them on the big screenYou won't always be watching films and shows on your Roku of course—and when your streaming device isn't doing anything else you can get images from your Google Photos library up on your TV. To set this up, you need to head to the Photostreams page on the Roku website, sign in using your account, and then follow the instructions online.Set up a cross-platform Roku watchlistThere will often be times when you see something interesting, but don't have time to watch it right away, and that's when the Roku watchlist feature can help. Select any movie or show from the home screen, and on the listing page use the Save button to add it to your list: You can then pick Save List from the main menu to see what you've saved.Pair your Bluetooth headphones to your RokuIf you've got a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and a Roku device that supports Bluetooth, you can pair the two together for some private audio listening— handy if you don't want to disturb anyone around you. You can do this by heading to Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Remotes & devices > Wireless headphones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nListen to your Roku via your smartphoneThere's another way to listen through headphones, and it doesn't require Bluetooth or wireless headphones. If you install the aforementioned Roku app on your smartphone, then plug a pair of headphones into your phone as well, you can tap Remote control in the app and then the headphone button to stream the audio right to your ears.\n    \n            \n            You can use the mobile app to listen over headphones.\n                                        Credit: Roku\n                    \n    \nMirror your other devices to your RokuApple devices: Roku sticks, boxes and TVs come with support for the Apple AirPlay standard built right in, so you can beam across audio and video from Apple devices, or even mirror your Mac display on the big screen. On the Roku, choose Settings then Apple AirPlay and HomeKit to make sure you're set up, then just select the AirPlay button on your Apple hardware.Android devices: For screen casting, you're not left out if you're on Android, though—as usual with Android—capabilities vary between devices. Samsung Galaxy phones have the smoothest integration: Swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen, choose Smart View, and your Roku should show up as a connection option (if it's on the same wifi network).Windows devices: If you want to mirror your screen to a Roku from Windows, the process is different again. First, enable the feature on the Roku via Settings > System > Screen mirroring. Next, from Windows, click the volume and wifi icons down in the lower right corner, click the Display button, then select your Roku.

Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts. For most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)As noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality. \nHow WhatsApp's Strict Account Settings protects high-risk usersStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on. Link previews are disabledHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blockedOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile. Only known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.How to enable Strict Account Settings on WhatsAppThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings. Settings must be changed on your primary device and cannot be updated on the web. Note that the feature will roll out gradually over the coming weeks, and may not be immediately available. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Suunto's route-planning tool lets you create and download GPX files without even creating an account. No paywall, no trial period—just open the page and start planning routes. And the tool itself works great.What you can do with the Suunto RouteplannerThe tool packs in everything you'd expect from a paid service, and then some:Route creation that uses different map types (outdoor, satellite, even specialized ones for winter and avalanche terrain)Routing that optimizes for your activity (running, hiking, cycling, mountaineering, roller skating, and more), using actual heat map data from real athletesHeat map overlays for about a dozen different sports so you can see where people actually goElevation profiles with ascent and descent numbers (crucial for not dying on climbs you didn't see coming)Export routes as GPX files that work with basically any GPS deviceShareable link generation (good for six months) so you can send routes to friends without making them create accounts eitherAbility to import and modify existing GPX or FIT files from other platformsOptional account sync if you own Suunto or Hammerhead gearYou don't even need to be in Suunto's ecosystem to use this. I was able to export a map to my Garmin watch with no problem. If you do have a Suunto or Hammerhead device, you can link your account and routes will sync automatically. \nHow to use the Suunto RouteplannerGo to routeplanner.suunto.com. From there, creating a route is pretty straightforward. If you let your browser share your location, it'll center on where you are. If not, just search for wherever you want to start. The controls on the right side let you switch between map types. The usual suspects are there: outdoor, satellite, light, dark. But then it gets weird in the best ways with a winter map, an avalanche terrain map for backcountry stuff, and, in a show of national pride, a dedicated Finland Terrain map. Respect.To actually connect points on the map, you have the following options:Free drawing (no automatic routing)Any road or path (ideal for activities by foot)All road types—avoiding hills (ideal for bikes)All road types (still ideal for bikes)Paved roads (ideal for road cycling)After you create your route, you simply download the GPX file and throw it on whatever GPS device you own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe six-month shareable links are a nice touch too. You can plan a route for a group ride or run, send everyone the link, and they can grab it without jumping through hoops. It's the kind of friction-free sharing that should be standard but somehow isn't.Why you should try the Suunto RouteplannerStrava and Komoot have trained users to expect paywalls for route planning. Of course, this could be strategic on Suunto's part, to give away the software in the hopes of selling the hardware. Or maybe it's just goodwill after years of user complaints about Suunto closing their tracking system Movescount. Either way, users win. You get a legitimately useful tool without opening your wallet or handing over your email address.If you're already paying for route planning elsewhere, try this first. Worst case, you waste five minutes. Best case, you cancel a subscription and pocket the savings. Even if you'e not looking to save money, having another route planning option in your toolkit doesn't hurt.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        When nature dumps a load of snow onto your driveway, it’s a free workout in disguise—but maybe not one you’re really in shape to tackle. If you’re always sore (or, worse, injured) after the first big storm of the season, read these tips on how to make shoveling easier on your body.Recognize what you’re asking your body to doLook, just because shoveling is a common chore doesn’t mean it’s one that everyone’s body is automatically ready for. Be honest about whether you’re trained for this. You wouldn’t ask “how can I run a marathon without my legs being sore the next day?” if you haven’t done any running at all in the past year. Jumping into something you’re not ready for is going to suck.If you know you’ll be shoveling a lot, plan ahead. Deadlifts in the gym will help you build the strength you need in your back, core, and legs, for example. If you’re not up for that, any full body fitness regime will leave you better prepared than doing nothing. \nAnd while we’re mostly talking about sore muscles and aching joints, it’s important to recognize whether your cardiovascular system is up to the task. If you aren’t used to exercising, and if you are older or have a heart condition, you may want to check with your doctor about whether shoveling poses a risk to your heart.Shovel early and oftenIf I could give the world only one snow-shoveling hack, it is this: Shovel when there is only a small amount of snow, even if you know there’s more coming. It’s far, far easier on your body to shovel three inches of snow four times over the course of the day, than to tackle 12 inches of snow all at once. If you missed your opportunity, you can still shovel in layers. Take a slice off the top, then a slice that goes deeper, and so on. Each shovelful will be much lighter and easier to deal with, even though you are taking more shovelfuls in total.Push instead of liftWe tend to envision shoveling as a repetitive bend-and-lift movement, but don’t forget that you can also use your shovel as a snowplow to push the snow in front of you. You can even buy shovels that are meant to be used this way, so consider an upgrade. Pushing the snow works best when it’s in a thin layer, so this works well with the advice to shovel when there’s only a small amount on the ground. But even if you have deep snow, pushing can save you some effort. Push until you have a pile, and then slice off the pile in layers.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep your back straightYou’ve heard the advice to lift heavy boxes “with your legs, not your back.” What this really means is that your back is best protected from injury when you can keep it straight. If your back rounds as it gets tired, take a break, or find a technique that allows you to keep your back straight even while it’s tired. For example, it’s most efficient to shovel in a deadlift-like motion: Your back is more or less straight, and you’re hingeing from your hips like a drinky bird. This does require a lot of work from your lower back muscles, so you are technically lifting “with your back,” but it’s safe as long as your back muscles are strong enough to keep your torso straight and stable. As your back muscles get tired, you may find it easier to keep your back straight if you keep it more upright. This is where a squat motion comes in—the proverbial lifting “with your legs.” Choke up on the shovel so the weight is as close to your body as possible, and bend your knees more so that you don’t have to bend as much from the hips.Warm up, take breaks, and go easy on yourselfDon’t kid yourself: This is a workout. And as with any workout, the first 10 to 15 minutes will feel the hardest. So keep the work light at first—take smaller shovelfuls, for example. Don’t forget to take breaks, either. You’re not cheating if you stop for a few minutes to let your body rest before getting back into it.Switching techniques (as above) and positions can help to distribute the strain across your body rather than just hammering the same muscles over and over. Do half your shoveling with the shovel on your right side, and half with the shovel to your left. \n            ",

It's hiding a worthy processor, double the memory you'd get from a streaming stick, and enough storage to download what you need to run all of your apps. It even acts as a smart hub, with Matter and Thread built in. It's taken me a long time to do anything with the Google TV Streamer. I reluctantly brought it into my home after realizing something more robust, but dated, like the Nvidia Shield, would be too much to manage alongside maintaining a home server. But since then, I've tweaked several things on the set-top box and enabled features I hadn't been using, turning it into a helpful hub in my living room.Enable \"Find my remote\" to never lose your Google TV Streamer remote againThis sounds like an obvious tip, but I've had the Google TV Streamer since it debuted in 2024, and it wasn't until this week, while writing this piece, that I finally enabled the remote finder. I had skipped it during the initial setup. The option is available in Settings > Remotes & Accessories. You'll see the Find my remote option in there.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe Google TV Streamer has a physical button on the back of the device that lets you locate your remote if it's stuck somewhere on the couch. But what if you can't reach the streamer behind the TV? Try one of your Google-enabled voice devices instead. If you have a Nest speaker or a Pixel phone nearby, say \"Hey Google, find my remote.\" The remote should start chirping if you've set it up.Set up the Google TV Streamer remote shortcutThe remotes that come with the Google TV Streamer feature a tiny, unregistered button with a star icon right next to the power button. By default, this shortcut does nothing! But you can change that in the device's system preferences.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIn Settings > Remotes & Accessories > Set up remote buttons, select one of three options for customizing the shortcut button. I set it up as my Google Home shortcut so I can easily turn the lights on and off from the couch. You can also set it up as a launcher for another app installed on the set-top box. Or create a shortcut to cycle through device inputs—this button is on legacy Chromecast devices with an included remote. It was removed from this generation of streaming devices, so if you miss it, you can spoof it back.For serious power users, map the shortcut to an app like Projectivity Launcher to make it a more powerful launcher button.Remap other buttons on your Google TV Streamer remote to be more useful\n    \n            \n            What Button Mapper looks like running on Google TV.\n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nDon't care for the default YouTube or Netflix buttons included on the Google TV Streamer remote? You can remap them with a third-party app, then affix a small sticker to indicate what it does. Install an app like Button Mapper or tvQuickActions. Then go to Google TV Settings > System > Accessibility, and turn on the service. After that, you can head back into the app to adjust what those physical buttons do. You can set them as shortcuts to other apps, or even something cheekier for others to discover when they press the button. Remove the clutter from the Google TV Streamer home screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nCan't stand all the recommendations and sponsored content Google TV suggests in the main carousel? You can effectively shut off some of the clutter so it doesn't visually overwhelm you. Go to Settings > Accounts & Sign-In > Your Account. and toggle on Apps only mode.This clears the clutter and \"sponsored\" content, leaving you with just app icons. Keep in mind that this turns off the \"Watchlist\" feature that's tied to your account and some Gemini voice search capabilities for specific content.Enable Google TV Streamer \"Developer options\" for more customization \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou'll need to enable developer options to enable features like faster animations and side-loading apps. It's easy to set up, and it's just like on an Android smartphone. Head into Settings > System > About, then tap Android TV OS Build 7 times.You'll see a little dialog pop up to let you know you've got developer access. Once enabled, a new menu will appear under Settings > System > Developer options.Limit animations to make navigation fasterThe Google TV interface is organized and functional, but its animations can slow down menu navigation. You can eliminate these animations and tweak other visual elements to speed things up deep within the developer settings.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIn Developer Options, scroll down to Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. Change one of these, or all three, from 1x to Animation off to turn off animations completely. You can also go the other way and effectively \"overclock\" the animations to speed them up, making them appear smoother. Side-load apps or an alternative launcherWith developer options turned on, you can enable USB and wireless debugging to use apps like Send Files to TV and atvTools to sideload APKs. But first, enable the \"Allow installs from unknown sources\" option in the Developer Options under Security settings. This allows APKs you've transferred over to the device to run on the streamer.Why would you want to go through the fuss of connecting to the Google TV Streamer this way? Because then you could access alternative streaming apps not available in the Play Store, or even an alternative launcher, like LeanbackLauncher.Pair headphones to your Google TV Streamer for private listening\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThis is one of my favorite little hacks that comes especially in handy when living in a house occupied by other people. When I do my workouts in the living room, I use a set of Bluetooth earbuds connected to the Google TV Streamer so I can hear the instructor's directions even when I'm face down in a plank and my kid is screaming in the background.The ability is available in the same submenu where you set up your remote. In Settings > Remote & Accessories > Pair Remote/Accessory, put your audio device into Bluetooth pairing mode, then watch it come up on the screen as an option. If you're successful, you can now pop on the buds when you need to. Be aware that audio latency can occur, and you might need to restart the connection—it is Bluetooth, after all.  Force your Google TV Streamer to choose the best resolution, regardless of bandwidthIf you don't care about your bandwidth and want full-resolution streaming at all times, you can set the best resolution to display as the default in your Google TV Streamer preferences. Go to Settings > Display & Sound > Resolution. Switch the Resolution from \"Automatic\" to 4K 60Hz, or whatever your TV's peak is. Once this is enabled, the Google TV Streamer won't downscale to 1080p. If you're a sucker for HDR, this is the same menu where you can turn it on so that it's always in high definition.The USB-C port can do more than charge up the Google TV Streamer. You can plug in a power delivery hub with extra ports to add components like external storage and effectively run your own all-in-one home media center. Those power delivery hubs usually include extra USB ports for peripherals, so you can hook up things like keyboards and game controllers for extra fun.  \n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Florence Ion\n                                I cover Android, smartphones, and the smart home.

Take a Message is a recently introduced feature for the Phone app that activates when the recipient is not available to answer (or declines the incoming call). The caller hears the following: “The person you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” If you, as the recipient, tap the Take a message notification on your device, you can see a transcript of the audio in real time and hit Answer if you want to pick up. (Take a Message will also detect spam calls and mark them with a warning.)A few users have reported that Take a Message has activated and allowed the caller to hear the recipient's background audio as they are leaving a message. It's important to note that this is not a widespread issue, and most of the reports come from people with older Pixel devices that no longer get OS updates. According to 9to5Google, Google is investigating the reports. \nAgain, while this doesn't seem to be a bug affecting most Pixel users, you can disable Take a Message if you are concerned about privacy, especially with unknown callers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to disable Take a Message on your PixelOpen the Phone app on your device and tap the icon in the top-left corner to open Settings.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies.

TV shows and movies follow story beats, meaning you can usually get a sense for where things are heading, but sports do not work that way. The totally unexpected can, and does, frequently occur—and that's the reason people keep tuning in, whether their team is dominating or an underdog.Sometimes, though, you can't catch the game live, but still want a bit of that feeling. That's why leagues offer extended highlights, featuring all the key moments, complete with the commentary from the broadcast. These can feel almost like watching the full game, and I love catching up with them the next day alongside my morning coffee. The problem: you'll typically find those videos on sites full of spoilers about who won, whether that's via a scoreboard at the top of the site or headlines blaring the results. If you're hoping for even a fraction of the fun of watching sports live, that's a problem.Don't Tell Me The Score is your solution. This simple website offers highlights for NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA games, with no scores or spoilers of any kind. The site interface shows only a bunch of icons representing all upcoming and recent games. Color logos means there are highlights are already available, and you can click or tap to start watching.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThis is my favorite way to catch up on games I missed. The videos, which are sourced from the league's official YouTube channels, tend to be a little over 10 minutes, meaning you'll see the highs and lows, but it won't take up hours of your day, and you won't know who won going in (provided you've also taken care to avoid spoilers via the TV, newspapers, social media, push notifications, or ill-timed texts from friends).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis tends to work really well, with one big hiccup: NFL videos can't be watched on the site itself, as the NFL prevents their highlights from being embedded on other sites. This means you'll need to click a link to watch the highlights on YouTube's website. This is a little annoying, but the YouTube pages usually don't include spoilers either, as long as you steer clear of the comments.I wish more leagues were supported—soccer highlights aren't offered at all, for example, and neither are the increasingly popular women's leagues. But if you're a fan of one of the \"big four\" North American sports, like watching highlights, and don't want to get spoiled first, Don't Tell Me The Score is worth adding to your daily rotation.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Outages happen, of course, as anyone who has Verizon can attest. But in the moment, theories were flying left and right. TikTok had just officially moved into U.S. control, leading some to speculate that the outage had something to do with this change in ownership. As one user put it, \"TikTok being down days after the people they were forced to sell to take it over does not feel like a coincidence.\" As it happens, it does appear that the changing of the guard was responsible for the outage—just not in the way that some conspiracy theories might suggest. TikTok finally released a statement on X Monday morning, attributing the outage to issues at a U.S. data center. The statement is as follows: \"Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.\"   The outage might not be the only thing different about TikTokFor its part, TikTok is very much operational at the moment. If the issue really was just isolated to a power outage at this data center, that data center appears to have patched things up. But that doesn't mean the company's reputation is patched up. Users are accusing the app's new owners of changing the algorithm, complaining of reset For You Pages, irrelevant content in feeds, and AI-generated content. I've seen users accuse the app of blocking anti-Trump and anti-ICE content, while comedian Gianmarco Soresi says even some of his non-political TikToks have \"zero views,” which he attributes to the ineffectiveness of the people running the app. (I've reached out to TikTok for comment on user reports of changes to the algorithm and will update if I hear back.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWe'll need more time to know whether or not there were serious changes made to TikTok's algorithm and user feeds in the wake of this sale. But the app is running—at least, for now.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Step counts can feel daunting, especially for people who work desk jobs or have physical limitations. The mere pressure to hit 10,000 steps can become its own source of stress—miss the goal by a few thousand steps, and it's easy to feel like the whole day was a wash. Rather than obsessing over hitting a specific step count, consider shifting your focus to a simpler, more achievable goal: sitting less. This reframing is not only easier to sustain, it could be just as beneficial for your health.Why you should break up sitting time\"Spending the bulk of your time seated is a major contributor to increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke,\" says Pamela Light, a certified personal trainer at Bay Club. And if you think you can't afford to take movement breaks during a busy workday, know that you don't need to transform into a marathon runner or achieve some lofty daily step count to see real health benefits. Simply interrupting your sitting time throughout the day can make a meaningful difference. \"Just ten minutes of movement is enough to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while slowing down muscle loss,\" Light says. And the science backs this up. In fact, a 2022 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that ten minutes of moderate exercise daily would prevent more than 111,000 premature deaths a year. Small changes could have a major impact on your life.\nHow to break up your sitting timeThe beauty of this approach is its simplicity and flexibility, especially compared to the stress of 10,000 steps. You don't need to do jumping jacks in the middle of your office or draw attention to yourself. Instead, try incorporating more movement to things you already do throughout the day. This could look like cleaning up around home, checking in with co-workers, helping with an extra chore, or walking around the block.Even bathroom breaks become opportunities for movement. \"Go to a restroom further away or on a different floor and take the stairs. Once inside, do 10 squats,\" Light says. \"They don't have to be huge or perfect, but giving the large muscles of your legs a chance to flex and release will feel great on your joints, boost your mood, and help your body to pull nutrients from the blood and into the muscles.\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOther ideas include pacing during phone calls and setting timers to remind yourself to take breaks. Besides, I know that when I get a chance to move, the time away from my desk will makes me more productive when I get back to it.The bottom lineInstead of chasing an arbitrary step count number that might feel out of reach, simply commit to stand up and move for a few minutes. Take a lap around the office, do some chair squats, or just stand and stretch for a moment. Instead of feeling guilty about what you didn't do, you can feel good about the small moments of movement you incorporated throughout your day.Plus, achievable goals are the ones we're most likely to stick with. If you're someone recovering from an injury, managing a chronic condition, working a demanding job, or simply new to thinking about movement, getting up once an hour is an achievable place to start.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

With more than 3,200 hours of winter sports coverage spread across broadcast, cable, and digital streaming platforms, finding what you want to watch can feel like a full-time job. So here's where and when you can watch the Olympics. Watching the Olympics is a deeply personal experience. Some love the technical precision of a perfect luge run; others dig the emotional narrative of an underdog’s journey to the podium; and some just want to catch the meme of the week as it happens. Because everyone's \"perfect Olympics\" is unique, I’ve also put together a viewing guide designed for the way you might want to experience the 2026 Games.How to watch the Olympics on broadcast and cable TVNBCUniversal has the exclusive rights to show the Olympics in the U.S. this year, and the network is practically going all-Olympics from the opening ceremony on Feb. 6 to the closing on Feb. 22. If you're watching the Olympics in the old-school \"turn on the TV\" way, the 2026 Winter Olympics are on broadcast channel NBC and cable channels CNBC and USA Network. If you're streaming the games, you'll be doing it from Peacock. \nNBC's broadcast Olympics coverageDuring primetime, NBC is showing Primetime in Milan, three hours of curated Olympics coverage, nightly, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT, except Super Bowl Sunday, when Primetime in Milan will start at 10:45 p.m. ET.  In the daytime, NBC will be broadcasting five hours of coverage daily focusing mainly on more popular Winter Olympics coverage like snowboarding, skiing, figure skating, and hockey. Daytime Olympics programming will begin at 7 a.m. ET most days, and continue through the early afternoon, depending on the daily lineup.NBC is also airing a nightly wrap-up of each day's events after the local news; the Olympics' opening ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET; live coverage of the closing ceremonies at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, with an encore showing at 9 p.m.; and 4K Olympics coverage on Super Bowl Sunday, beginning at 7 a.m. ET.Cable television Olympics coverageNBC-owned cable networks USA Network and CNBC will also feature Olympics content during the games. USA Network: USA Network will be devoted to Olympics coverage nearly 24/7 during the games, showing a mix of live events and encore showings of past events. Because of the six-hour time difference from Italy to the U.S., USA Network will show live Olympic events nightly beginning around 2 a.m. ET, and feature continuing coverage through the early afternoon. CNBC: CNBC is devoted to curling (really). The cable network plans to broadcast a nightly \"Best of Curling\" show on weeknights at 5 p.m. ET, with long form coverage on weekends. If you are planning to stream the Olympics, you'll be doing it on Peacock, NBC's streaming platform. Peacock will stream every single session of all 116 medal events live, as well as offering full-event replays of every event available on-demand. How to watch the Olympics if you're a casual viewer \"I want to be part of the conversation, but I don't need to watch biathlon at 4 a.m.\"If you want high production values, dramatic stories of inspiring athletes, and exciting contests curated by sports broadcasting pros, the mainstream coverage is for you. Don't miss the opening ceremonies on Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, and catch as much of NBC's primetime coverage as you have time for. It's bound to be packed with crowd-pleasing events, give you lots of background on different athletes, and Olympics breaking news, but without a lot of obscure or boring sports.Pro tip: Subscribe to the Two Guys, Five Rings podcast; Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang's Olympics coverage is bound to be hilarious. How to watch the Olympics if you're a single-sport fan\"I'm only here for the luge.\"If you religiously follow a single sport in the Olympics, be it hockey or snowboarding, and you really don't care about, say, inspirational ice-dancer stories, your best bet is Peacock's Sports Hub, where you can watch every qualifying heat and every medal contest of only the sport you like, either live or on-demand.Pro tip: Coordinate your calendar with NBC's interactive schedule to make sure you know when everything is happening. How to watch the Olympics if you're a gossip\"Half the fun of the Olympics is dishing about it.\"If the Olympics is better as a shared experience, watch NBC.com's broadcast coverage in one window, and check out the social media feeds of NBC's \"Creator Collective,\" where TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube influencers like Kylie Kelce, Anna Sitar, and Jordan Howlett will be watching along. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPro tip: Don't sleep on Reddit communities r/olympics and r/WinterOlympics2026.How to watch the Olympics if you're curious \"I'm irrationally passionate about a sport I'd never heard of before today.\"If you love to discover strange new sports, the Winter Olympics are going to be fun. Skip the mainstream coverage on NBC and browse through Peacock's Sports Hub catalog for sports you've never heard of. Pro tip: Don't miss the debut of Ski Mountaineering (\"SkiMo\"), the only brand-new sport at the 2026 Games. It’s a grueling hybrid where athletes who hate ski lifts for some reason hike up steep mountains before carving down high-speed technical descents. How to watch the Olympics if you're a completist\"I absolutely cannot get enough Olympics and I want to watch as much as is humanly possible.\"If you have a lot of time on your hands and want to see literally everything, you'll need Peacock, and to get familiar with its \"Discovery Multiview\" feature, which lets you watch up to four sporting events at the same time. Pro tip: Go to the NBC Olympics Full Schedule and use the \"My Stuff\" feature to build a personalized calendar before the games start to plan your epic Olympic binge. How to watch the Olympics if you're a tech-head\"I want to feel the snow in my face without leaving my house.\"If you want the highest resolution, most immersive Olympic experience possible without traveling to Italy, do not miss 4K All-Day on NBC and Peacock on Sunday, Feb. 8 for 17 hours of 4K HDR coverage of both the Olympics and the Super Bowl. And download the Peacock app for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to watch the Olympics in augmented reality, or check out the \"spatial cinema\" broadcast of the Olympics on your Apple Vision Pro. Pro tip: NBC is rolling out a new streaming feature called Rinkside Live for Olympic hockey and figure skating. It lets viewers choose from multiple curated feeds of \"immersive, never-before-seen views.\" \n            ",

If you've been eyeing Apple's top-of-the-line smartwatch, that moment is now: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has dropped to $549.99 on Amazon, saving you $250 off the retail price. This matches the lowest price it has yet reached, according to price tracking tools.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 was released in September 2023, and after the Ultra 3 dropped two years later, it was inevitable that the Ultra 2 would see a price reduction. The cool thing is, you don't need the latest model to receive the latest WatchOS features, since Apple has a good record of updating its products for many years to come.The Ultra is the premium Apple Watch model, with the biggest case size, brightest screen (3,000 nits), deepest water resistance (100 meters), and longest battery life (up to 36 hours), and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is packed with fitness-focused features. Even if you aren’t a health nut, it also has a lot of great features for casual users. (People who want a reliable sleep tracker can learn a lot about their sleep habits with the Ultra 2.) You can read more about this watch on PCMag's \"excellent\" review.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCurrently, small and medium sizes are available for $549.99, and large for $561.29, though not in all color variations. If you want to spend less and still get a good device, the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra can be found for $319 refurbished at Amazon. The newer Apple Watch Series 11 is $489.95 right now. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

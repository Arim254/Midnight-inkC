Fraudsters prey on people's fear, confusion, and desire to protect their money, which may lead targets to hand over login credentials, make irreversible wire transfers, or provide other sensitive information without stopping to question their actions. Android users in the U.S. will soon have extra protection against scams targeting their financial apps, preventing threat actors impersonating bank representatives from accessing data on their devices. Google's in-call scam protection is designed to prevent users from sharing their screens with threat actors and help them avoid revealing their banking information. How Android in-call protection worksAndroid's scam protection kicks in if you are on a phone call with a number not saved in your contacts and attempt to open a participating financial app. You'll get a pop-up warning that the call is likely a scam with a reminder not to make payments or share personal information and a button to end the call (and stop screen sharing). There's also a 30-second delay on further action on your device, which Google says is designed to disrupt any sense of urgency. \nNote that financial institutions must opt into in this feature—at this time, Google has specifically named Cash App and JPMorganChase as partners, though it indicates expansion to other popular fintechs and banks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle initially rolled out in-call protections for banking apps to UK users earlier this year as part of a larger package of security features announced ahead of Google I/O. That launch also included real-time scam detection alerts for calls and texts, improved theft protection via remote lock and identity check, key verifier for Google Messages, and device-level Advanced Protection (in addition to account-level settings). Alongside the US pilot, in-call scam protections will now cover most major banks in the UK as well as financial apps in Brazil and India. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        The update screen is a normal occurrence on Windows machines, so of course hackers are now manipulating it to sneak malware onto devices. The scheme, a recent iteration of a ClickFix attack, is designed to trick you into executing a dangerous command under the guise of completing a \"critical security update.\" But what you're actually doing is installing an infostealer that hands data over to bad actors. When a Windows update pop-up is actually a ClickFix attackClickFix is a social engineering ploy that uses tactics like fake error messages, CAPTCHA forms, and command prompts to deliver malware to your device. As PCMag reports, the Windows update scam is a pop-up that looks like a standard Windows blue screen but is actually a full screen browser page being displayed from a malicious domain. The ClickFix element is a set of keystrokes—not part of the real update interface—that have the user paste and execute a malicious command, ultimately delivering malware to their device. These instructions have an air of urgency, which is a common element of a scam. \nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Huntress have detailed the exact mechanism behind this attack, including an iteration in which users are prompted to verify they are human (rather than complete a security update). As Bleeping Computer outlines, the malicious code is embedded into the pixel data of PNG images, and the final payload is one of two known infostealers.According to the Huntress analysis, following a recent law enforcement operation, fake Windows update pages continue to exist across multiple domains, but those domains no longer seem to host the malware payload. That doesn't mean, however, that this attack, or some version of it, won't pop up elsewhere. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to stay safe from this ClickFix attackIf you run Windows on your device, you've probably seen a blue or black update or error screen many times, and you may not be suspicious if your computer randomly begins an update or prompts you to take an extra step to confirm it. But while a legitimate update screen will have a progress indicator and instructions not to turn off your computer, you should never need to input manual commands. This is a red flag of a ClickFix attack and not something a trusted service will require.  Of course, it's important to keep your computer up to date. Microsoft releases security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, known as Patch Tuesday, and you can enable automatic updates on your machine to ensure you get fixes as soon as they're available. If you want to take additional steps to prevent ClickFix attacks on Windows, you can disable the Windows Run box to prevent unauthorized access to commands.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is warning consumers about a type of fraud in which threat actors pretend to be from trusted financial institutions in order to obtain login credentials and gain access to financial and personal data. The consequences are high: With stolen credentials, scammers can gain full control of your accounts and your money. According to the FBI advisory, criminals will quickly wire funds from your bank to cryptocurrency wallets, making the money nearly impossible to trace and recover, and lock you out of your account in the process. Here's how account takeover scams work—and how to avoid becoming a victim. \nAccount takeover scams may impersonate your bankMost account takeover scams use social engineering: a series of tactics designed to manipulate you into giving up personal information, downloading malware, or paying money to bad actors. Scammers impersonate financial institution employees as well as customer support and technical support staff and reach out to targets via text, call, or email to say that their account has been compromised in some way.They may tell you that there have been fraudulent charges on your account and send you a link to report the fraud—but this is actually a phishing site designed to harvest your login credentials. They may ask directly for your username, password, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) code over the phone. In some cases, they may even claim that your information was used to buy firearms and pass you off to a second scammer impersonating law enforcement. They're counting on you to feel fear and confusion and act quickly to \"resolve\" the issue by handing over your information. The FBI has also identified a version of account takeover using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, in which scammers buy ads that appear to be for legitimate businesses but actually allow them to place malicious links to spoofed bank websites higher in search results. How to avoid falling for account takeover scamsWhile being targeted for an account takeover may be unavoidable, there are a few red flags that can help you identify the fraud before it goes south. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you should always be wary of calls, texts, emails, and other communication (such as social media messages) from someone claiming to be from your bank or creditor, especially if they ask for personal information like your username, password, or time-based one-time password (TOTP). Reputable institutions will not contact you to request your credentials or other sensitive data—so these are almost certainly phishing attempts. You should also be wary of trusting websites that look like they belong to your financial institution, especially if you click to them from a browser search. Cybercriminals can easily build convincing (but spoofed) websites and place the malicious links at the top of search results. Bookmark the trusted link rather than going through a search engine, or use the verified app on your mobile device. Always avoid clicking directly from unsolicited communication, and check URLs and email addresses carefully, as scammers can also use homographs to hide malicious links.  Finally, protect your personal information. Use complex, unique passwords stored securely (such as in a password manager), enable a stronger form of MFA (and never give away codes), and limit what you share online. Scammers may use what you've posted—like your date of birth, pet's name, or information about family members—to get past your security questions, guess your password, or make an impersonation attempt sound more convincing. The IC3 also recommends monitoring your financial accounts for irregularities, such as unauthorized withdrawals or transfers, which may be a sign of an account takeover. Consider setting up transaction alerts with your financial institutions to be notified immediately of any suspicious activity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        You may have a keen eye for spotting scams, but fraudsters are finding new ways to weaponize trusted systems to avoid detection. For example, threat actors are generating real Apple support tickets to phish two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and gain access to iCloud accounts. The scheme, detailed on Medium by a security researcher and software product manager Eric Moret, shows how social engineering tactics can sow just enough fear and confusion to trick even those who know the red flags. (The money transfer scam that conned a financial advice columnist out of $50,000 is another example.) How scammers are exploiting Apple's support systemThe Apple support scam started with a text message from Apple containing a 2FA code, followed by verification notifications across devices, indicating that someone was trying to log into Moret's account. He then received an automated call from Apple with another 2FA code. The text was delivered from a five-digit short code, and the call from a toll-free number, both of which are used by legitimate businesses and not necessarily red flags of a scam.\nThe next call, however, came from an Atlanta-based 404 phone number. The caller claimed to be from Apple Support, stated that Moret's account was under attack, and assured him that they were opening up a support ticket. During a follow-up call lasting 25 minutes, Moret received a real Apple Support case confirmation via email (it turns out anyone can create an Apple support ticket in someone else's name) and was directed to reset his iCloud password. He was then sent a link via text—from the 404 number this time—to close the ticket. After clicking through, Moret was directed to a phishing website that spoofed a real Apple page (the URL was appeal-apple[dot]com), where he was prompted to enter a 6-digit 2FA code he'd just received via text. An email to his inbox then alerted him that an unknown Mac mini had been used to sign into his iCloud account, which the rep on the phone told him was \"expected as part of the security process\" and \"standard procedure.\" Moret then immediately reset his iCloud password again to kick the unauthorized device off.  It may be easy in hindsight to see the signs: the unsolicited call about an urgent security issue, the 404 number, the phishing link that isn't a real Apple subdomain, the request for an authentication code. But the Apple support ticket—with a real case number and official emails from apple.com domains—lent just enough credibility, and the multiple 2FA notifications just enough urgency, to work.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's the problem with social engineering. It manipulates emotions and instincts that are stronger than logic and reason, leading to actions that are not in our interest. How to stay safe As always, you should be wary of anyone who calls, texts, or emails you about a security or account issue, even if you have received real security alerts or they have a legitimate case number. Don't click links, enter credentials, or provide codes when prompted by these unsolicited callers. Don't accept reassurance from anyone on the phone, no matter how calm and confident they sound. If you are concerned, you should reach out directly using trusted contact information or open support tickets yourself. Always check URLs and subdomains carefully, as hackers can play tricks to make them look legit. Also, know that simply having 2FA enabled isn't enough to keep your accounts secure. Some forms are (obviously) easily phished, so if possible, you should use a multi-factor authentication method like a hardware key or WebAuthn credentials (biometrics and passkeys) rather than codes. \n            ",

An RC, as the name implies, is the version of a software update Apple intends to release to the general public. Before it rolls out, though, Apple sends the update out to beta testers to see if there are any bugs or glitches that need addressing. If not, these are the updates that will hit your Apple devices sometime this month. That includes watchOS 26.2, Apple's latest OS for its line of smartwatches. While there aren't nearly as many new features and changes in this update as there were in watchOS 26 proper, there are still some key things to highlight in this RC. In fact, as noted by 9to5Mac, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  \nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. Going forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.Music app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 RC that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. When does watchOS 26.2 come out?Apple doesn't have a set date for watchOS 26.2, or iOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2 for that matter. However, now that the RCs are out, these updates are likely coming soon. As long as there aren't any glaring bugs or glitches in these RCs, Apple will likely ship the updates sometime this month.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I started with a basic bidet added onto a standard toilet, but I always knew the time would come when I would make a big upgrade. That time was this Black Friday when I pulled the trigger on the Loniko Smart Toilet, and I'm so glad I did. It's $444.99 (originally $549.99) after using the additional $30 on-page coupon, and it's worth every penny.\nMy first experience with the Loniko Smart Toilet was over Thanksgiving, which I spent at my parents house; they were very excited for my brothers and me to try their new splurge in their guest bathroom: the toilet. The lid opened when I walked into the bathroom, welcoming me to sit on its heated seat. As I said, I've been using bidets in my home for years, but never one like the Loniko. The toilet comes with a remote you can prop on your wall for easy access. You can control the bidet's stream and direction, turn on the dryer, which was surprisingly effective and gentle, and do all the things the toilet does automatically, like opening and closing the lid, flushing, etc. After realizing that most decent bidets cost upwards of $300, I decided to snatch this toilet when it went on sale during Black Friday.Being able to control the temperature of the water in the stream is a huge deal for me, especially in the winter when the water in my home is extremely cold. Cleaning the toilet is also pretty easy. It has a skirted design, so there are no nooks and crannies near the base where dirt can get trapped. The toilet also automatically cleans itself after each flush. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep in mind you'll need an outlet close by to enable all its fancy features. You can also choose to get a tankless model, which results in quieter flushes, saves water and energy, and looks more modern, but it's harder to install (I went with the regular tank toilet and it flushes quietly enough for me).\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

While Meta is no bastion of user privacy by any stretch of the imagination, this particular claim is, fortunately, not true. You shouldn't expect the company to necessarily respect your data, but you also don't need to worry that future iterations of Meta AI will be generating text based on your Instagram DMs.If you've seen these claims on your feeds, too, you know they're often quite stark and hyperbolic. Snopes highlights one such viral Instagram post that reads, \"Every conversation. Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI.\" Users scrolling through Instagram might understandably stop to read these claims, and may, also understandably, feel concerned about their data across their various Meta accounts.The issue is, these claims are misinterpreting a real change Meta plans for its privacy policy. Once the policy updates on Dec. 16, Meta is making changes to the way it collects data from user interactions with Meta AI. Going forward, the data generated when using Meta's AI products can be used to personalize the content you see on Meta platforms, as well as the ads that are placed in your feeds. Once again, it's just more data collection in the pursuit of promoting user engagement and ad relevancy.\nPart of the confusion is in the way this privacy policy is worded. Take the following statement, a part of Meta's explanation of the user information it uses: \"Interactions with AI at Meta and related metadata. For example, information you or others exchange with AI at Meta like content and messages.\" That might sound like Meta is scraping your DMs to train its AI, but it's saying content and messages you share with Meta's AI are what's fair game. Just sending messages and attachments to users on Meta platforms doesn't end up in Meta AI's training data, but if you share those messages and attachments with the AI, then it might. Meta confirmed as much with outlets, sending the following statement: “The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn’t about DMs at all, it’s about how we’ll use people’s interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience. We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn’t new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.” Make no mistake, of course: If you're using a Meta messaging platform, the company does collect your data. In both the current and upcoming privacy policies, Meta does say messages you send and receive, including their content as well as their metadata, subject to applicable law, can be used by Meta for a number of functions. That might include personalizing Meta products to fit each user; improving Meta products in general; promoting safety and security on its platforms; storing, moving, and processing your data around the world; and processing information when the law requires.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, there are categories Meta will not use your messages for, unless you share those messages with its AI. That includes using your data for analytics and services for business; \"providing a seamless experience\" across Meta products; personalizing ads on Meta Audience Network; research and innovation for \"social good;\" anonymizing your info; and sharing data with law enforcement. In some of these cases, Meta will collect metadata about your messages—perhaps things like time or location sent—but not the message data itself. Again, this article is not meant to flatter Meta; rather, it's to debunk unnecessary concerns. Social media posts often misrepresent these nuanced privacy and security points—especially when those posts turn up the dramatics. Understand if you're using Meta products, your data is constantly being collected—but, in this case, your messages aren't suddenly being scraped to train AI.The best thing you can do to preserve your privacy and security with your Meta messages is to use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) whenever possible. WhatsApp has E2EE built-in, and Meta has automatically started rolling it out for Messenger, but you might need to manually start an E2EE chat for existing conversations in the app. The same goes for Instagram: Meta offers E2EE, but you need to enable it yourself. In either app, tap the name of the chat to check whether or not that conversation is currently E2EE.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

This month, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is all for it—provided you get yourself a Forest Service-issued permit first. In fact, cutting your own tree on federal land is actually a pretty affordable and ethical way to source a Christmas tree. The only catch is you must follow specific guidelines, which can vary from forest to forest.Before you grab your axe and head into the woods this holiday season, here’s what you need to know about the USDA's tree-cutting permit program.Why you should cut your own tree from a national forest What's cool is that securing yourself a tree-cutting permit isn't just allowed—it's encouraged. Cutting down and carrying out your own holiday tree helps contribute to good overall forest health. Through this permit program, you’ll be helping to thin densely populated stands of small-diameter trees. Removing the trees already designated for removal by the Forest Service allows other trees to grow bigger and stronger. Plus, you’ll get the pride and satisfaction of chopping down the perfect Christmas tree for your home. It’s a true win-win. \nBut let's say you don't care about the environment—this is all about your needs and experiences. Well, then: In addition to helping maintain a healthy forest, cutting a holiday tree is a special tradition that can be shared with families and friends to create memorable holiday experience. For many families, venturing into the forest to cut a Christmas tree for the holidays is a treasured tradition carried on for generations. And most important of all: It can be a lot cheaper than buying one from a tree lot.The USDA Forest Service sells Christmas Tree permits through Recreation.gov. Prices range from $5 to $20, depending on the location of the forest. To buy your permit in advance and find your local participating forest, use this site, which also provides guidelines for the allowable cutting areas that you’ll need to review before you start choppin’.In three simple steps, you can begin your quest to find and bring home your own Christmas tree:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChoose your forest. Determine which participating forest works best for your Christmas tree outing. Each forest will have specific guidelines and season dates for cutting a holiday tree.Be safe and prepared. Carefully read the details and rules of the applicable permit, and consider the Need to Know suggestions to prepare for your visit.Buy a permit. Purchase and print your permit before heading out to the forest.Tips for cutting your own Christmas treeI spoke with the Recreation.gov team to get some additional tips as families looking to prepare for their Christmas tree cutting adventure.Measure the space in your house so you can pick the right size tree once you are in the forest. (Don't assume you can eyeball it, or you'll find yourself with a Griswold situation on your hands.)Check road and forest conditions and prepare for adverse weather.  Before cutting, make sure you are in a designated cutting area, and follow all guidelines for locations where tree cutting is allowed. Avoid venturing onto private property.Choose a tree in an overcrowded stand to help thin it out.Cut your tree close to the ground. The stump you leave behind should be about 6 inches tall.Bring a rope and tarp to move your tree from the cutting area to your vehicle.  Secure your tree to your vehicle to ensure it remains in place for your trip home.What else you need to know Again: You can only cut down trees located in designated and approved areas in the forest. This permit program is run by the USDA Forest Service, which is not the same thing as U.S. National Parks. If you’re unsure whether you’re allowed to snag a tree in a certain area, visit this page and type in either the name of your state, or the name of the forest you have in mind.Christmas tree permit sale dates may vary by national forest. Recreation.gov encourages families to check local forest guidelines to gather all information before purchasing to ensure they are prepared. A new permit is required each year to cut your own Christmas tree.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

    "body": "\n        \n        In the long-running Android vs. iOS competition, iPhones have historically had the edge in terms of parental controls: They've been a bit more straightforward and intuitive, and easier for caregivers to understand and manage. Apple does many things well, and getting its apps and devices working seamlessly together is definitely one of them.Google, however, is gradually improving the experience for parents, with a batch of updates earlier this year, and now some more changes as part of a significant Android 16 upgrade. The latest changes mean more controls can be accessed on your kids' devices.What's new in Android 16The usual Android caveat applies here: Each Android phone maker does things slightly differently, though there's not actually too much variation in this particular area. The latest Android 16 updates mentioned above are rolling out now to Pixel phones (and I've tested them on a Pixel), but will take a while to reach other handsets—Samsung phones will most likely get them early next year, for example, with One UI 8.5.\nSo what's new? Essentially, more of the existing parental controls are available on the Android devices of your youngsters, so you can get at them from their phones and tablets as well as accessing them remotely. It should make life easier if you're with your kids and they pass their devices over to you.You can find the options that have been added to kids' devices by opening Settings on the phone or tablet of your young person and choosing Parental controls. Right away you'll see a toggle switch for enabling on-device controls, and when you do enable them you need to enter a PIN—to stop your kid from changing these settings themselves.\n    \n            \n            The new on-device controls in Android 16.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are then four sections you can access: Daily limit, App limits, Downtime, and Website content filters. Tap on any of these to set restrictions for the current device, which can be adjusted depending on the day of the week in some cases. Pick Downtime, for example, and you can set times during which the device is locked. These match the tools you've previously been able to manage remotely.Select Daily limit, then turn on the Use daily limit toggle switch, and you're able to control how many hours your kid can use their phone or tablet for each day. There's also a bar chart showing device usage over time, so you can see how much screen time your child has been taking advantage of. These settings are simple, understandable, and a breeze to use—you don't have to mess around with Google accounts or family relationships if you don't want to. You can just enter a PIN and start making changes—you don't necessarily have to connect these settings to any other devices. If you want to manage them remotely, though, Google has a wider parental control system in place.Google's Family Link controls The new Android 16 controls that appear on devices can work independently of anything else, but Google already offers plenty of options if you need them. Everything is managed through the Google Family Link portal, which you can access on the web or through the apps on Android or iOS.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can use Google Family Link to set up Google accounts for your kids, and then manage what they're able to do with them. The idea is that they sign into their Android devices using the account you've created for them, and because Google knows you have a verified connection to them, you can put restrictions on those devices remotely.All the usual safeguards and protections are covered: You can set screen time limits, manage the apps your kids can use (and for how often), put blocks on certain websites and categories of website, and put parental approvals in place for making purchases through Google's various digital storefronts. These mostly match what's now available on-device.\n    \n            \n            Google Family Link on the web.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere's a location tracking element to Google Family Link as well, so you can see where your young people are at all times, and even get notifications based on their movements: You might want to get a ping when they turn up at school, for example, or when they leave home. All this can be managed through the apps.More recent updates let you control the amount of screen time your children can have during school hours, and there are also now tools for managing the contacts that youngsters are able to interact with—as yet you can't get to these controls directly on your kids' devices. There's plenty in the way of reports on usage too, alongside these controls.Add everything up, and Google now has a fairly comprehensive set of parental controls that you can manage from just about any device, or from the devices your kids are using—assuming you've given them Android phones or tablets. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        I've said it before and I'll say it again: Safari is better than Chrome. Apple's default browser runs faster, is less cluttered, offers privacy features Google would never contemplate, and doesn't try to cram AI down your throat.But that doesn't mean Safari is perfect. Like all browsers, it works better if you install the right extensions. Here are a few I've found in the past year or so that make the best browser even better.Block ads and other clutter\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe internet is increasingly useless without a good ad blocker, and the best ad blocker for Safari—which works on both macOS and mobile devices—is wBlock. This extension uses the built-in ad blocking functionality offered by Safari, which is much faster than the workarounds that extensions on browsers like Chrome need to use. It also supports a number of popular blocklists, with automatic updating. Or you can go even further and install Userscripts. Best of all, it's completely free. Try it out if you're not happy with your current ad blocker.\nAdd a dark mode to sites that don't have one\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWe can argue endlessly about whether dark or light mode are better (and I have), but we can all agree it's annoying to be using dark mode only for the websites you're browsing to be white as snow. That's where Noir comes in. This extension forces Dark Mode in Safari on websites that otherwise don't offer the feature. It's a must-have for dark mode enthusiasts.Automatically open picture in picture when you switch tabsSafari, on mobile, will keep playing videos using picture-in-picture mode if you switch to another application or tab. The desktop version of Safari doesn't do this, which is a shame. Autopip is a Safari extension for Mac that adds this feature. The result: you can keep watching a video in the background while you're working in another tab or application. It's perfect if you're the sort of person who leaves a video playing while you're working on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nQuickly copy the URL for the current site\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nArc, the browser, is dead, and if I'm honest I only miss one feature: the ability to copy the URL of the current website using the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-C. Yes, it's a very specific thing to miss, but I can't overstate how much of a habit this became for me. And I can keep the habit thanks to Supercopy, a Safari extension that adds the keyboard shortcut to Safari. Yes: that's all it does. I use it dozens of times every day, though, so for me it's well worth keeping around.Filter Reddit to be less rage inducing\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'd love it if I spent less time on Reddit and I'm sure I'm not alone. The problem: there's a mix of useful and rage-inducing stuff on that website. The good news is Protego lets you filter Reddit to be less infuriating. The idea is to pick a few subreddits you know, in your heart of hearts, you shouldn't be looking at. Do that and you'll be able to use Reddit without ending up down rabbit holes of rage and disgust. You can also filter out posts using keywords and hide promoted content. Trust me: you'll be happier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        AI is everywhere! Writing essays, editing photos, producing social-media slop, doing your browsing for you, making plenty of mistakes—and now, if you've installed the latest Android 16 update (currently rolling out to Pixel phones), summarizing your notifications so you have less text and fewer alerts to wade through.The new summarization feature, as per Google, will \"help you cut through the clutter and stay focused,\" and give you \"quick understanding and context at a glance.\" I'm all for cutting through the clutter, so as soon as the update landed on my own Pixel device, I decided to enable the feature and see how useful it really is.How AI summaries work, and how to turn them on\n    \n            \n            Enabling the feature on an Android phone.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAI notification summaries won't automatically take over your phone, after the update—you need to enable them manually. From Settings, head to Notifications, then tap Notification summaries to turn this on. The same screen lets you choose which apps you want notifications summarized for.\nThere are actually two parts to the new update: the actual notification summaries, and what Google is calling a \"notification organizer.\" This organizer is designed to group and silence lower-priority notifications (including social alerts and promotional messages), though there doesn't appear to be a separate toggle switch for this.Of course, other Android phone makers will be able to implement this in whatever way they choose. It looks as though Samsung is testing the feature with the One UI 8.5, which should be launching in beta any day now. A full release of the software is expected early next year, alongside the Galaxy S26 phones.Using AI notification summaries for 24 hoursReady to banish notification clutter from my life, I turned on AI summaries for all my apps to see exactly how this worked. For a start, it doesn't apply to all apps, at least not yet: My Snapchat and Instagram alerts remained the same as always, so further updates will be needed from Google and app developers before this is something you see everywhere.The apps I saw summaries for most often were Google Chat, WhatsApp, and Slack—almost always in group conversations, and some of the time for single messages (the length of the message seems to affect this somehow). And the summaries were ... mostly okay. They tended to catch the gist of who had said what, and in that sense were an accurate recap of what I was missing by not actually opening these apps.\n    \n            \n            The summaries work, up to a point.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThese summaries did update as more messages were added, but the summary preview window is only a couple of lines long—so once multiple people start piling into a group chat, the summary isn't going to be able to cover everything. From the lock screen and pull-down notification shade, it's possible to expand notifications to see full messages (as usual), and then minimize them back to the summary view again.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere was one occasion when the AI notification summaries got confused by the Lifehacker slack and by the various @mentions included—attributing a message to the person who had been tagged in a message, rather than the person who had sent it. On the whole, though, there were no obvious mistakes, just certain details left out from summaries of longer chats that I would've liked to have known about.Now I've tested this out, I'm going to turn it off again, for a couple of reasons—and inaccuracy isn't really one of them (though that might certainly creep in). First, given the small size of the preview window, I'm not sure an AI summary is any more useful than the first couple of lines of text you get as standard anyway. That's usually enough for me to tell whether or not a message is important before opening it.\n    \n            \n            This Slack summary wasn't fully accurate—and Snapchat alerts weren't affected.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSecond, I'm not sure I really want my messages and group chats summarized—at least not the important ones. If a friend, family member, or work colleague has something to tell me, I'd like to know exactly what it is, rather than reading a précis. It feels like AI is being used just for the sake of it—and not for the first time.I didn't see any evidence of the notification organizer in action, by the way, perhaps because of the way I've got my Android notifications set up—there are now a host of granular options for alerts in Android, for silencing and dismissing notifications. This feature sounds vaguely useful, but again, I'm not sure I'm ready to hand over the job of judging how important notifications are over to AI just yet.\n            ",

The ANC AirPods 4 are $99 (originally $179.99) after a 45% discount. This is the lowest price they've ever been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe AirPods 4 have updated USB-C charging. Both models (the ANC and non-ANC) are powered by Apple's H2 chip, so you'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" and answer calls. Apple added a live translation feature to the ANC model when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year.The biggest difference if you choose to go with the non-ANC is that you'll miss out on the charging case with a built-in speaker, which you can use with Find My to locate it if you lose them. You'll also miss features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio (combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBoth versions are rated IP54 for dust and water resistance, offer up to five hours of listening per charge (up to 30 hours with the charging case), and can handle automatic switching with your other Apple devices.

That isn't always the case with Apple, however. The company has a long history of removing functions from one generation of devices to the next, whether that's removing the disc drive from its MacBooks back in 2012, or taking away the iPhone's Home button in 2017. Some of these changes are good, some are controversial, while others are undone altogether: MagSafe and HDMI both found their way back to MacBooks after all.It's not often I hear about Apple removing software features from one generation of product to the next, however. So, imagine my surprise when I saw a number of headlines this morning asserting that the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple's latest and greatest flagship, is missing a feature found in the last five generations of Pro iPhones—and nobody noticed for nearly three months. Night mode is missing from Portrait mode on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The short answer? We have no idea. This was not something Apple announced publicly, of course. In fact, Macworld spotted the change in an Apple support doc: If you scroll down to the section where it says \"On supported models, you can take Night mode photos with Portrait mode,\" and click the hyperlink on \"On supported models,\" you'll pull up a list of iPhones that, mysteriously, doesn't include the 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max. The list includes:\niPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro Max For the uninitiated, Night mode and Portrait mode are technically two distinct features. Portrait mode was released first, all the way back on the iPhone 7 Plus, which utilized the dual-camera system to add a bokeh effect to shots of people. Those early shots were hit or miss, and were often no replacement for a true DSLR, but as Apple's tech and cameras have improved, so has Portrait mode. Part of the improvement was the introduction of Night mode. This feature, which Apple was a bit late to the game on, allowed you to take brighter images in low-light environments by lengthening the time the shutter stays engaged. Older iPhones without the feature would take images that were hard to see without the flash engaged, but Night mode could pull in details as long as there was just enough light present in the scene. Since the iPhone 12 Pro, Portrait mode came with the option of Night mode, as well. If you're trying to take a portrait shot in a dark environment, Night mode kicks in and gives the image a chance to turn out brighter and more detailed. But now, it seems, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max do not have this option. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, these new iPhones still have Night mode: Per that previously mentioned support page, you can take brighter shots at night when taking standard photos, selfies, and time-lapse videos. It just seems Apple decided to remove the feature for Portrait mode shots on its latest Pros.Of course, this news started breaking on Dec. 3, nearly three months after the 17 Pros launched. If it took this long for someone to notice a missing feature, was it really all that important to begin with? I don't have a 17 Pro, so I really can't say, but I also can't say I take many Portrait mode shots in dark environments. I've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this story if I hear back. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Manually or automatically wiping your browsing history is a well-established way of protecting your privacy and making sure the digital trail you leave behind you is as short as possible—but it's important to be aware of the limitations of the process, and to understand why deleting your browsing history isn't always as comprehensive an act as you might think.In short, the records of where you've been aren't only kept on your local computer or on your phone, they're found in various other places too. This is why fully wiping away your browsing history is more difficult than it initially appears. Modern browsers typically sync your browsing historyJust about every modern browser can now sync your browsing history across devices, from laptop to mobile and back again. There are benefits to this—being able to continue your browsing on a different device, for example—but it means that deleting the list of websites you've visited on one device won't necessarily clear it everywhere.\nConsider Apple's Safari, which by default will sync your online history, bookmarks, and open tabs between all of the iPhones, iPads, and Macs using the same Apple account. You can manage this by selecting your account name and then iCloud in Settings on iOS/iPadOS or in System Settings on macOS.\n    \n            \n            Deleting browsing history in Safari.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWhether or not Safari syncing is enabled through iCloud will affect how browsing history is deleted—when you try to delete this history on mobile or desktop, you'll see a message telling you what will happen on your other devices. In Safari on a Mac, choose History > Clear History; on an iPhone or iPad, choose Apps > Safari > Clear History and Website Data from Settings.Most other browsers work in the same way, with options for both syncing history and deleting history. In Chrome on the desktop, for example, open Settings via the three-dot menu (top right): You can manage syncing via You and Google > Sync and Google Services > Manage what you sync, and clearing your history via Privacy and security > Delete browsing data.The apps and sites you use are tracking youAside from all the history your actual web browser is collecting, you also need to think about the data being vacuumed up by the apps and websites you're using. If you log into Facebook, Meta will know about the comments you've left and the photos you've liked, no matter how much you scrub your history from Edge or Firefox.How much you can do about this really depends on the app or site. Amazon lets you clear your search history, for example: On the desktop site, click Browsing History on the toolbar at the top, then click the gear icon (top right). The next screen lets you delete all or some of your browsing history, and block future tracking—though you won't be able to reorder items as easily, and your recommendations will be affected.\n    \n            \n            Clearing data from a Google account.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nMeta lets you clear your Instagram and Facebook search history, at least: You can take care of both from the Meta Accounts Center page in a desktop browser. Click Your information and permissions then Search history to look back at what you've been searching for. The next screen gives you options for manually and automatically wiping your search history.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle runs a whole host of online apps as well as a web browser. You can manage all your Google data from one central point from your desktop browser: Your Google Account page. Click Data and privacy to see everything Google has collected on you, and click through on any activity type to manually delete records or set them up to be automatically deleted after a certain period of time.Your internet provider always knows where you've beenThe final place there will be copies of your internet browsing history are on the servers of your internet service provider—that is, whichever company you're paying for access to the internet is keeping logs of the places you've been, for all kinds of purposes (from security to advertising). And yes, this includes sites that you open while in incognito mode.How this is handled varies from provider to provider. For example, AT&T's privacy notice states that the company will \"automatically collect a variety of information\", including \"website and IP addresses,\" \"videos watched,\" and \"search terms entered.\" The company says this data will be kept for, \"as long as we need it for business, tax, or legal purposes.\"\n    \n            \n            A VPN can hide your browsing from your internet provider.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere's not a whole lot you can do about this either—it's a trade-off you have to make if you want access to the web. Some providers, including AT&T, will let you opt out of certain types of information sharing if you get in touch with them directly, but you can't prevent the tracking from happening in the first place.What you can do is mask your browsing with a VPN (Lifehacker has previously picked the best paid VPNs and the best free VPNs for you to try out). As all your internet traffic will be routed through the VPN's servers, your internet provider will no longer be able to see what you're doing. Your VPN provider will, however—so find one that you can trust, and which has a no-logs policy that's been verified by a third-party security auditor.\n            ",

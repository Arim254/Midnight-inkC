Its initial goal was to guarantee that artificial general intelligence (AGI), a type of AI that is theoretically better at humans at most tasks, would benefit everyone.The company has gone through a number of changes in the years since. It hasn't been a true nonprofit since 2019, when it moved to a \"capped-profit\" structure, which limited profits to 100 times any investment. Musk even sued the company last year, claiming it had ditched its original mission in favor of profits. But now, OpenAI is looking more like a traditional for-profit company than ever. On Thursday, it announced the company will now operate under a new for-profit structure, called OpenAI Group PCB, a public benefit corporation. OpenAI's nonprofit arm, which is now called the OpenAI Foundation, holds a $130 billion stake in OpenAI Group PCB, and controls the for-profit company. OpenAI says it is particularly focused on how this move will affect its goals of achieving AGI, and ensuring that AGI \"benefits all of humanity.\" As OpenAI sees it, the better its for-profit businesses perform, the more funds the OpenAI Foundation will have to continue its philanthropic work.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo that point, OpenAI says the OpenAI Foundation is committing $25 billion to two key objectives. The first is to health and disease, as the OpenAI Foundation will aim to create open-sourced health datasets and offer funding for scientists. The second goal will be to bolster \"AI resilience,\" which OpenAI sees as \"maximizing AI's benefits and minimizing its risks.\"According to OpenAI, the OpenAI Foundation and OpenAI Group both have the same mission, and that the terms of the new structure require the for-profit side to advance that mission. What does this mean for OpenAI?The way OpenAI puts it, this move is the best of both worlds for the company. It asserts that it will continue to operate with the same values and goals as it did prior to this restructuring, while at the same time having more freedom to raise capital to fund those efforts.That second point is certainly true. CEO Sam Altman has been working for nearly two years to restructure the company into something that can more easily compete financially with other for-profit companies in the AI space, like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Other strictly-AI companies, like Anthropic and xAI, also have this type of structure.Already, the move has solidified funds for OpenAI: The Japanese-baed SoftBank had previously pledged to a $40 billion investment, with $10 billion in April and another $30 billion in December. However, that investment was contingent on the company's restructuring plans. Had OpenAI not restructured, SoftBank would've dropped its investment to $20 billion. By bolstering its for-profit core, OpenAI earned itself that extra $20 billion.OpenAI has also agreed to extend an agreement with Microsoft that allows the latter to use and sell OpenAI products. The original agreement ran through 2030, and allowed OpenAI to cancel the deal if the company achieved AGI. But now, the deal runs through 2032, even if OpenAI achieves AGI, so long as the tech has the \"appropriate safety guardrails.\" An independent expert panel will make the call on whether OpenAI has achieved AGI. Rights to OpenAI's research will still be capped when OpenAI achieves AGI, or by 2030, whichever comes first.It's no secret that AI is big business, so this move could realistically continue OpenAI's many financial successes. It may also heat up the race to achieve AGI, as it now allows Microsoft to pursue that benchmark with OpenAI's technologies as well. But against this news is a lingering, and concerning, question: Are we in an AI bubble? And will that bubble burst? OpenAI currently has $1 trillion in AI deals, though only pulls in $13 billion in actual revenue. Perhaps its restructuring will allow it to develop more lucrative revenue streams, but even still, AI is generating a lot of investment without the tangible returns you'd necessarily expect. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Until Nov. 11, referral codes from existing members get you more money off your hardware purchases. The discount detailsLast month, Peloton rolled out upgraded versions of its fleet, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread+, Tread+, and Row. The new devices are known as the Cross Training series and, as such, are named the Cross Training Bike, Crosstraining Tread+, etc. If you want to know how they differ from the old models, I wrote an explainer here, but the basic gist is that the proprietary touchscreens on which you follow guided classes now swivel around, making it easier to hop off your machine and do, say, a strength or yoga class. The Plus line also comes with a movement-tracking camera that uses AI to correct your form, suggest when it's time to add more weights or reps, and monitor your workouts. As you can assume, these are pricier than their predecessors, which is why the current referral promotion might be of interest to you. If you get a referral code from an existing All-Access Member, here's what you can get off at checkout: $300 (instead of the usual $250) off your cart when you purchase a new Peloton Cross Training Bike$700 off your cart (instead of $500) when you purchase a new Peloton Cross Training Bike+$500 off (instead of $300) when you get a Peloton Cross Training Tread$1,200 off (instead of $600) a purchase of a new Peloton Cross Training Tread+$200 off a new Peloton Cross Training Row+ All the discounts will return to normal after Nov. 11. (Note: This probably isn't the best time to get a Cross Training Row+, as the typical referral discount on that is $300.)Your referrer has to be an All Access Member, not someone who uses one of the less-expensive, app-only versions of Peloton's digital offerings. The referrer can't be renting their machine, their membership can't be paused, and they can't be a Peloton employee. Notice, too, that this specifically applies to new devices. That means you can't use the referral code to get money off a purchase on Peloton's resale platform, Repowered, although that's always a solid option if you're looking for equipment on a budget. You don't have to have the Cross Training series to get a good workout (although I enjoyed my demos of those devices); I have been using the same Peloton Bike for nearly five years and love it—I ride it every day. You can redeem your code on the Peloton website or at Peloton stores. Bear in mind, however, you have to be a new customer. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to find a referral codeIf you want to be the referrer, not the referee, here's how to generate the code that will get you some brownie points with your fitness-focused friends. The easiest way is to go to this link and log into your Peloton account. Otherwise, head to members.onepeloton.com and select the hamburger menu in the top right corner, then hit Refer friends. If you're not seeing that or the link above didn't work, you're not eligible to share a code. You can also do this on your mobile app by tapping the Community tab, then Add Friends on the upper right, then Refer Friends.Remember how I said you'll get brownie points with the people you refer? You get something else, too: You can give out up to $1,200 in referrals, but you also get a free month of your All Access Membership for every person you refer. Once someone makes a purchase with your code, you'll get en email containing a code of your own, plus instructions on how to redeem it, after three to five business days. The voucher codes are valid for three months after their issue date. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n            Staff writer\n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

There's WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Signal, Telegram, and iMessage (if you're on iPhone), and that's just the dedicated chat apps. You might have to keep up with new messages on Instagram, TikTok, Threads, even Spotify. If I install one more app with a messaging feature, I'm going off the grid. As it happens, another non-chat app is joining this list. On Tuesday, Zillow—yes, Zillow—announced its app will also now support messaging. Starting today, you can send people messages in the app you use to look at houses you will most likely never actually buy. We live in interesting times, indeed. Of course, Zillow's goal here isn't to become the next WhatsApp. In fact, you can only choose to chat with one other person on Zillow—at least, that's the case for now. The idea of Zillow messaging is strictly to chat about listings you find through the app, without needing to leave Zillow to do so. The goal for most app developers is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, so there's a cynical case to make here for Zillow trapping its users within the app. If you don't move to another chat app to talk about a listing, you're more likely to interact with additional houses on the app. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut I actually see the logic here: If you're in a housing market with a lot of listings, you're probably firing off a number of them every day to interested parties—namely, whoever you're buying the house with. Keeping those conversations in the same app as those listings could be a smart way to keep track of all those houses, instead of the usual routine of \"wait, which house was that? I can't find the text you sent me.\" And the fact that Zillow is limiting this experience to one chat partner at this time means you're not going to be DMing a number of people about houses in your area. This does seem designed for people who are trying to buy a house together to do so with a bit more convenience.How to try Zillow messagingThis feature is live as of this article. To get started, open Zillow on your smartphone or in your web browser. On the app, tap \"Inbox;\" on the web, click your profile in the top-right, then choose \"Inbox.\"  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to start a chat, you need to invite the other person to join you. To do so, choose \"Invite now,\" which will pull up a pop-up about the feature. This screen explains the invite link is good for 24 hours, and that you can only invite one person for now. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nChoose \"Share invitation,\" and Zillow will let you share it wherever you'd like. You can copy the link, and paste it in another chat app, or choose a destination for Zillow to share the link to directly.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        To the disappointment of Judgment Day fans, The Rapture did not happen as predicted at the end of September, but keep your fingers crossed for November, when aliens are expected to invade. This one's a way more concrete prediction than the Rapture. Unlike Jesus, we can actually see the alien starship in our telescopes, cleverly disguised as an interstellar comet. And it's not just conspiracy theorists or Joe Rogan Podcast guests sounding the alarm—a Harvard astrophysicist kicked off the whole thing. So hold on to your butt!The ballad of 3I/ATLASBack in July, NASA spotted 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet about the size of Manhattan, passing through our solar system on its journey from God knows where. This is only the third interstellar comet we've ever spotted, so it's a big deal. In September, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb (who had a long, legit career until recently) published \"News on 3I/ATLAS: Lack of Non-Gravitational Acceleration Implies an Anomalously Massive Object\" which posits that the comet could be a giant spaceship that is going to fly behind the Sun on Oct. 21 (hey, that's the day I'm posting this!), and while it's shielded from our view, the \"potentially hostile\" comet/spaceship could do all kinds of aerial maneuvers, release a squadron of X-wings, or really anything. Then he appeared on a bunch of podcasts and news shows to talk about his \"it could be aliens!\" idea and it spread in mainstream press.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe cranks took over from there, connecting Loeb's observations with the prophecies of \"Baba Vanga\" (a blind, Bulgarian fortune teller that cuckoos love), lies about NASA, Loeb's own invocation of the \"Dark Forest\" theory (where hostile aliens lurk silently waiting to strike), and everything else you could image, then they used AI to make videos about the invasion. So many AI videos about the invasion. So are aliens landing in November?I wouldn't bet on it. If you read Loeb's papers or listen to interviews with him, it's clear he's careful to never make any predictions. He says things like 3I/Atlas \"could be on a mission to release mini probes meant to invade Earth,\" or \"If it’s a technological object, then it might maneuver itself.\" Oh, it could be on mission? It might do something? I could be about to grow 17 heads, and I might release mini probes too. Loeb is not wrong, technically, nor is he lying, but he's not being entirely honest either, because he doesn't follow up his statements with \"...but it's so unlikely, it's barely worth considering.\"And this isn't the first time he's done this.What's the deal with Avi Loeb?Remember 1I/ʻOumuamua? That cigar-shaped interstellar object people thought was an extraterrestrial probe in 2017? Loeb started that, too. He co-authored a paper suggesting it could be a lightsail—a thin, artificial sheet propelled by starlight—sent by an alien civilization. A possibility, but surprise! it turned out to be a comet. Then there was the meteor. In 2022, Loeb claimed that a meteor that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in 2014 was interstellar in origin and possibly technological. He  dredged up fragments from the ocean floor, and held press conferences about the \"spherules\" that might be alien technology. After sighing heavily, other scientists responded with: \"Sure, it might be alien technology, but it isn't,\" and I hope they added, \"why don't we put some money on the next 'space probe?'\"It's a pattern: Loeb makes a qualified outrageous claim, gets the headlines (\"Harvard Scientist: Comet Could Be Alien Spaceship!\") while hedging enough to say \"I never said it was aliens\" when the prediction fizzles. He seems to be trying to raise awareness about how we think about extraterrestrial life and push against the knee-jerk scientific dismissal of the subject, but the way he's doing it is questionable.Science isn't sexy enoughIn 2025, \"We should carefully study this unusual object\" doesn't land you a book contract and media blitz like \"Could this be an alien invasion fleet?\" does, but it also doesn't corrode public trust in science, and legitimate scientists studying interstellar objects, searching for biosignatures, and working on SETI get drowned out by the noise. And what happens in November? Our Venusian Sky Brothers might descend upon Earth with cake and ice cream for all, but I'm putting my money on the cranks moving on to flat-Earth theories or weather machines, while Loeb generates headlines in a few months with another \"this time, it really might be aliens!\" object. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Starting today, new users in California will have to scan their faces while setting up their accounts to ensure that they're both real and that they match their profile photos. Called Face Check, the new mandatory feature is the first step in a new initiative from Tinder's parent company Match Group, which says the goal is to help reduce \"spam, scam attempts, or [bots] operating automated fake profiles.\" When signing up, users will need to complete a \"liveness check,\" during which they'll take a video selfie from various angles. After that, the app will compare the selfie to profile pictures also uploaded during setup, and if it determines that they match, the user will get a \"Photo Verified badge\" and they'll be able to finish making their account. Tinder also says the system can determine if a picture has been used across multiple accounts to help prevent impersonation.While Face Check is new to the United States, it's already been launched abroad in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and \"several countries across Southeast Asia.\" According to Tinder, \"when coupled with other recent safety initiatives,\" Face Check has led to an over 60% decrease in users exposed to \"bad actors,\" and an over 40% decrease in reports of bad actors.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFace Check's debut also coincides with the rise of AI image generators, and while the company's announcement post doesn't explicitly call out AI, it's not hard to see how it could prove handy against bots using generated photos to pretend to be someone who doesn't even exist. Traditional catfishing methods, such as using stock photos, can be detected with diligent reverse image searching, but AI's ability to quickly create novel, believable, and specifically tailored results has made it harder than ever to know whether you're speaking to a genuine human online.At the same time, as other apps begin to collect personal information like government IDs, there is a privacy concern. Tinder says that Face Check only uses your video selfie to complete the verification process, and deletes it shortly after review, although it does generate a \"non-reversible, encrypted face map\" that is stored to \"help verify new photos, detect fraud, and prevent duplicate accounts.\"As someone who met my husband on Twitter (RIP), I'll leave it up to you whether that's worth it. Have you tried just getting real good at posting instead?For now, though, you might have to wait a bit until Face Check actually makes its way to you. First, Tinder is not forcing existing accounts to use Face Check, which is why I assume it's using a badge to indicate the accounts that have gone through Face Check, even though it's mandatory during setup. Second, Face Check is rolling out slowly. Tinder says that it will come to additional states \"in the coming months,\" although the company did not provide an exact timeline.As for other apps, Match Group (which also owns OKCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, among others) says it will extend Face Check to additional platforms in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Unfortunately, even the best practices come with a dark side if you take them too far. In this case, that dark side is Parkinson’s Law, an observation that suggests the longer you give yourself to do something, the longer you’ll take to actually get it done. The truth of the matter is that you can schedule, plan, and fret your way right into accomplishing nothing. It’s always better to get difficult things done as soon as possible, so let’s consider the pitfalls of Parkinson’s Law, and how you can overcome them.What is Parkinson’s law?The origins of the axiom are a little delightful: Cyril Northcote Parkinson described the phenomenon in a 1955 humorous essay in The Economist, and it’s been credited to him ever since. You can read the entire essay, but its main point is this: \"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThough it had a funny start, the idea grew until it was being studied in more serious capacities. Researchers published their findings on Parkinson’s law in the Psychonomic Bulletin & Review in 1999, finding that people tend to consider how much time is available to complete a task rather than considering how little time it might actually take. Basically, we give our future selves a little too much wiggle room when planning our schedule, then our future selves graciously accept all that extra time that could be spent doing something else. After all, our past selves, wise as they were, carved out that time for one task, and who are we to challenge that? You can probably find examples of this in your own life. If your boss gives you an easy task but sets a deadline for the following week, are you likely to get the work done immediately? Parkinson's Law gets me, more often than I'd like to admit, especially when I'm getting ready in the morning. When I used to give myself an hour to get out of the house, I'd spend it dawdling, scrolling on my phone, or generally loafing, so I started giving myself half an hour instead, with an added goal of grabbing coffee. Essentially, I started the \"getting ready\" process at the same time each day, but with an earlier deadline and an extra task. I found I still made it to where I needed to be on time, even after stopping to treat myself. Set shorter deadlines—and stick to themConsider the example of having a week to do a simple task at work. Instead of setting a week from now as the goal date and letting the task hang over you, pick a day to get it all done—ideally, one or two days before the due date, so it’s fresh in your mind if you have to discuss or explain it afterward. Schedule a block of time to do whatever needs to be done, but give yourself less time than you normally would. If you think distractions or other issues might crop up during your work time, take steps (like indicating you’re busy) to mitigate them instead of accommodating them with a time buffer.This approach is useful because it prompts you toget things done sooner and without overthinking them. It also gives you a bit of a failsafe: If you submit your work early and discover there are issues with it, you have all that saved time to address those problems and resubmit while still meeting your original deadline. (This is why I always recommend setting two deadlines for any big project.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGive yourself less time to complete tasks, not moreAs you can see by now, to defeat Parkinson’s Law, you need to give yourself less time to complete your tasks. Consider the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which says that to be your most productive, you have to have just the right amount of stress—not too little and not too much. When you have too much time to devote to something, you don’t have enough stress to motivate you.To test this out, spend a few weeks shaving some time off your allotments for different responsibilities. Use timeboxing to schedule your entire day down to the minute, using blocks of time in your calendar. If you think it will take you 30 minutes to answer all your emails in the morning, give yourself 20. If you think it will take an hour to compile reports for a big project, give yourself 45 minutes. When you cut that time down and know you only have limited space to finish a task, you will hopefully find yourself locking into a state of deep work, where you're totally focused on the task and can move through it systemically. That feeling of urgency is key.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

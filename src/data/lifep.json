Starting today, new users in California will have to scan their faces while setting up their accounts to ensure that they're both real and that they match their profile photos. Called Face Check, the new mandatory feature is the first step in a new initiative from Tinder's parent company Match Group, which says the goal is to help reduce \"spam, scam attempts, or [bots] operating automated fake profiles.\" When signing up, users will need to complete a \"liveness check,\" during which they'll take a video selfie from various angles. After that, the app will compare the selfie to profile pictures also uploaded during setup, and if it determines that they match, the user will get a \"Photo Verified badge\" and they'll be able to finish making their account. Tinder also says the system can determine if a picture has been used across multiple accounts to help prevent impersonation.While Face Check is new to the United States, it's already been launched abroad in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and \"several countries across Southeast Asia.\" According to Tinder, \"when coupled with other recent safety initiatives,\" Face Check has led to an over 60% decrease in users exposed to \"bad actors,\" and an over 40% decrease in reports of bad actors.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFace Check's debut also coincides with the rise of AI image generators, and while the company's announcement post doesn't explicitly call out AI, it's not hard to see how it could prove handy against bots using generated photos to pretend to be someone who doesn't even exist. Traditional catfishing methods, such as using stock photos, can be detected with diligent reverse image searching, but AI's ability to quickly create novel, believable, and specifically tailored results has made it harder than ever to know whether you're speaking to a genuine human online.At the same time, as other apps begin to collect personal information like government IDs, there is a privacy concern. Tinder says that Face Check only uses your video selfie to complete the verification process, and deletes it shortly after review, although it does generate a \"non-reversible, encrypted face map\" that is stored to \"help verify new photos, detect fraud, and prevent duplicate accounts.\"As someone who met my husband on Twitter (RIP), I'll leave it up to you whether that's worth it. Have you tried just getting real good at posting instead?For now, though, you might have to wait a bit until Face Check actually makes its way to you. First, Tinder is not forcing existing accounts to use Face Check, which is why I assume it's using a badge to indicate the accounts that have gone through Face Check, even though it's mandatory during setup. Second, Face Check is rolling out slowly. Tinder says that it will come to additional states \"in the coming months,\" although the company did not provide an exact timeline.As for other apps, Match Group (which also owns OKCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, among others) says it will extend Face Check to additional platforms in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

A mind map isn’t just a diagram that lays out tasks, but a visualization of how ideas connect to one another. Once you see the core concepts represented with shapes and their connections represented with lines, you can better understand your material overall, especially if you're more of a visual learner. Here’s what you need to know when using a mind map for studying and how to make the creation of one a lot easier.What is the benefit of a mind map for studying?A mind map helps you generate ideas based on their association to other concepts, plus better retain information. You start by placing your central idea in the center of the page, then drawing branches for other ideas. For instance, if you have to write an essay about the Civil War, you’d write that in the center, then add branches like “causes,” “participants,” and “outcomes.”Each of those related concepts can and should have its own branches. From \"participants,\" you might draw two lines branching out to \"the Union\" and \"the Confederacy.\" Under those, you can list the states that were on each side. Obviously, these maps can get big pretty fast, so while I normally recommend using a pencil and paper for your studies, as it helps you retain more information, a mind map is an example of an exception to the rule. Apps and digital templates are better because you won't run out of space or waste time erasing and crossing things out to make room. You can prepare for this endeavor by taking your notes carefully in class and writing down the most important keywords; you can even use mapping as a standalone note-taking technique, branching related ideas and words off of one another as you hear them. Again, this could get convoluted quickly, so only try it if you're relatively familiar with the material already or are prepared to revise and redo a map quickly in real time. When mind-mapping, keep expanding outward. For instance, in the example above, “causes” would include slavery, of course, but also differing economic policies, cultural values, and opinions on how far the federal government’s reach should go. Use different kinds of lines to connect all related ideas, too; all three of those were related to slavery in some way, as well, so they can be connected not only to “causes,” but to “slavery,” which helps make it even clearer, visually, that the Civil War was fought primarily over slavery. In that case, you might want to use dotted lines to represent ideas that are connected to more than one core component of the material. The way you set it up is dependent on your preferences; just make sure you put a key somewhere so you remember what dotted, squiggly, straight, or any other kind of line means. Don't forget to mess with shapes, either. Facts can be squares, dates triangles, etc. Stick it all in your key.The goal of this is to stimulate your creative thinking and help you make connections between ideas, plus visualize main themes, which is useful for grasping subjects or outlining an essay.Studying use casesLike I said, you can try doing this while you take notes in class. Depending on your capacity for quickness and your overall artistic ability, it might be a solid note-taking approach for you. But there are other ways to incorporate mind maps into your studies. Some reading comprehension techniques call for you to summarize your reading periodically, for instance. Creating a mind map here, instead of writing out a paragraph of a summary, can be a good way to reframe how you're thinking. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnother example is a technique like 2357, which asks you to revise and review your materials on the second, third, fifth, and seventh day after first studying them. Mixing up your revision styles helps you come at the content from all angles, so one of those days should include a mind-mapping session. You can also make a mind map while dual coding, or practicing using audio and visual cues to stick something in your memory twice as well. You can make a mind map while listening to a lecture or speaking your content out loud for that one-two punch. The best mind-mapping templatesYou can do this on a piece of paper or in Microsoft Word or similar software, using different kinds of lines and shapes to connect and outline your ideas. You know what’s even easier, though? Using pre-made templates. Here are my favorites:Lucidchart is an online software that allows you to create three editable charts with its free version, but you can buy an individual subscription for $9 per month if you want unlimited documents. The free version also only allows you to have 60 shapes on a given document, but it does come with 100 templates. The paid version allows unlimited objects and comes with premium shapes and templates, too.Miro is free to use and extremely collaborative, so this is a great option if you’re working on a group project. It’s easy to use, comes with a variety of templates, and works well across devices, so you can change your map on your phone if you’re on the go. There are 5,000 templates in the free version and, like Lucidchart, you can make three boards, but to unlock unlimited boards, the option to export in higher definition, and the ability to sort boards into folders, it'll cost you $8 per month. Of course, Canva, the free online graphics software, is always an option for mind-mapping or any other visual tasks. The site has over 1,000 pre-made templates available for you to use and is extremely easy to navigate. I had a professor in grad school who loved assigning mind maps and, cheap as I am, this was the option I always went with. There are a little over 4,000 built-in mind map templates here, which I didn't actually know in school, so if you use those, you'll already be smarter than I am because I was making these things by hand, dragging and dropping shapes all over my Canvas. My favorite: XmindThere are apps available that work seamlessly across not only your computer, but your phone. I'm partial to Xmind, which allows you to use drag-and-drop templates that come color-coded and ready to fill in. It's excellent for group project, as it allows multiple people to access and edit the same map, and most of its functionality is totally free. For no cost, you can access a three-day version history cache to see previous edits and map versions, plus unlimited topics and maps, which is rare in the mind-mapping space. Xmind Premium is $10 per month and a Pro tier is $15, but annual subscriptions are much cheaper: $59 for Pro and $99 for Premium. Pro gives you more color and slide options, plus the ability to add equations, topic links, numbering, tasks, and attachments to maps, so if you're studying materials that rely on those, you might need to upgrade. You'll also net custom themes and more export formats. Premium adds AI-generated to-do lists to the package, alongside a 30-day version history cache, unlimited storage space, and unlimited collaboration.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Windows RE offers a series of functions to help you root out whatever is ailing your machine. Using it, you can choose to reset your computer, run an automated diagnosis and repair tool, adjust settings to see if any are causing the issue, uninstall previous updates that might be tripping up Windows, and restore to a previous back Windows backup, among other potentially helpful options. It's a necessary feature of the operating system, meant for times when a simple shut down and restart doesn't help your PC get back to normal operations. So it's not ideal when Windows ships with a bug that not only breaks part of the OS, but also breaks the part of the OS designed to help fix your PC.As spotted by Tom's Hardware, a bug in Windows 11's October update, KB5066835, hinders your ability to access Windows RE. The recovery environment can still load if you need it, but you'll find you won't be able to select any of the options it offers to try to fix your PC. That's because this bug breaks USB device functionality specifically in Windows RE. Simply stated, your mouse and keyboard will not work in Windows RE, preventing any navigation within the recovery environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is obviously bad news for anyone who wants to use Windows RE to fix a problem with their PC—including, ironically, this Windows RE-specific bug. But you might think that so long as your particular issue with Windows isn't prohibiting you from actually using your computer, you could live without Windows RE for the time being. As Tom's Hardware points out, however, it's not so simple: When your PC has trouble starting up, it will automatically boot into the recovery environment. That's normally a good thing, since you'll have the tools to help diagnose and solve the issue. However, when Windows takes you to a screen where you can't use your mouse and keyboard, or interact with any elements whatsoever, you're kind of stuck. Microsoft has issued a patchThe good news is a fix is officially here. Microsoft had called out the bug as a known issue in Windows 11, version 25H2, and said it was working on releasing a fix \"in the coming days.\" That fix came sooner than expected. The new KB5070773 update restores USB device functionality in Windows RE, so you should update as soon as possible. If you have normal access to Windows, all you need to do is head to Start > Settings > Windows Update, and install it when it appears.However, if your PC is stuck in Windows RE, it's a bit trickier to solve. As Tom's Hardware explains, Microsoft recommends users to use their touchscreens or PS/2 ports if available. If not, you may need to rely on a USB recovery drive to get your PC back up and running.  Windows is experiencing other issues, tooWindows is going through it this month. This same October update also broke localhost functionality, which impacted any apps that connect to services running locally on your PC. (Luckily, Microsoft did issue a fix for that bug.) Then, last week, the company also officially ended support for Windows 10, and though it still offers Extended Security Updates for any user that wants to enroll their PC in the program, it puts the security of roughly half a billion PC users into question.   This Windows RE bug is just one more critical issue PC users have to deal with. Hopefully, Microsoft's next Windows 11 build introduces only fixes, and no additional bugs.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Maybe it's because I was an only child, but as useless as the animated paperclip (officially known as \"Clippit,\" by the way) was for advice, I did enjoy having a buddy on my desktop while I worked on essays. Now, Microsoft is bringing that same energy back, but for AI. And, finally, I think I understand the Clippy hate.Called Mico, the character is part of Copilot's fall release, which includes a dozen new updates. Some of these are what you'd expect by now: There's a new memory feature that ensures every new conversation doesn't start from scratch, and better integration with outside apps like Gmail or Google Calendar. But there's also a few more out-there ideas, like using Copilot Mode in Edge (which originally released in July) to pick up old browsing sessions right where you left off, even if you already closed all your tabs.By far, though, the most unexpected update is for Microsoft to lean back into its old animated mascot tendencies. Mico isn't the first AI companion, nor is it the most expressive. Grok will sell you on a whole anime girlfriend, if you're into that. But it does call back to a pedigree I once thought long buried (and now, I realize, maybe for good reason).\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLike Clippy, and unlike Grok, Mico leans more towards the cute side of things, and is just a small, smiling, disembodied blob. It's entirely optional, but the idea is that it works with Copilot's voice input to make you feel like you're being listened to, changing color and reacting based on the tone of the conversation.If that all sounds a bit vague, it's because, well, Mico (and the rest of the Copilot fall release) is still rolling out. I don't have access to it yet, so the best I can do is check out this video shared by Microsoft.\nThe idea, though, is clearly to make AI seem friendlier. Microsoft announced Mico in a post titled \"Human-centered AI,\" and made a point out of debuting the character alongside a new \"real talk\" mode, which the company says \"challenges assumptions with care, adapts to your vibe, and helps conversations spark growth and connection.\"And I think that's where I finally start to raise my eyebrows a bit. On the plus side, in Microsoft's video, Mico doesn't appear to actually talk, so much as play simple animations. It's not going to build a parasocial relationship with you to the degree that Elon Musk's animated AI girlfriend, which comes with a romance bar to level up, does. On the other hand, though, it still feels like a way to lower my guard. Describing Mico to The Verge, corporate VP of product and growth at Microsoft AI Jacob Andreou said \"All the technology fades into the background, and you just start talking to this cute orb and build this connection with it.\"But what does it mean to be \"connected\" to a face that is inherently tied to a product?Essentially, with Mico, you're now looking at a big smiley face whenever you interact with Microsoft's AI, even as it continues to try to look at your screen, or redirect your web traffic, or bloat your computer with features that, according to testing done by TechRadar, can hurt performance. Maybe, actually, I should have my guard up when interacting with AI and not letting the technology fade out of my mind.For instance, Mico's release comes a week after Microsoft announced an initiative to \"Make every Windows 11 PC an AI PC.\" It's no wonder the company wants to give it a friendly face while it advertises features that take action for you based on simple voice commands. But am I comfortable with a future where I just tell my computer what I want, with little direct involvement, and expect the company that runs the cloud powering it to know what that means?To a degree, I can see the convenience in that. But it also leaves me at the whims of Microsoft, and it's hard not to see Mico's friendly smile as a way to spin that as a good thing, rather than as a loss in control. At least Clippy could look sarcastic.Maybe I'm overreacting, but in the same blog where Microsoft introduced Mico, it also debuted \"Copilot for health\" and \"Learn Live.\" In the former, the company actively encourages you to take your health questions to its AI, while the latter supposedly lets Copilot act as a \"voice-enabled Socratic tutor.\" Microsoft promises that Copilot for health, at least, pulls from credible sources like Harvard Health, but as AI continues to face security risks and accusations of model collapse, I remain skeptical about letting it aid in self-diagnosing or tutoring my kid.And perhaps that's on me. When I finally get Copilot's fall release, it could prove itself. But Mico is the exact type of mascot that's meant to dismantle skepticism while it's still healthy. It benefits Microsoft, but \"corporate-centered AI\" and \"human-centered AI\" aren't the same thing. At best, I think Mico will seem obnoxious, in the same way enforced positivity usually does. But at worst, it comes across as a first attempt to make your computer seem like a friend you make requests of, rather than a machine you own. While users fight for right-to-repair and warn about dropping tech literacy among people who spend all their time with computers, it's hard not to see the idea of Copilot as a friend rather than something a bit more sinister.The Clippy connections aren't just in my head, for what it's worth. Andreou also told The Verge that \"Clippy walked so that we [Mico] could run.\" But as we approach Halloween, I'd like to remind Microsoft that sometimes, dead is better.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Walk through any park these days and you might spot them: people sporting bulky weighted vests, adding 10, 20, even 30 pounds to their morning stroll. Scroll through social media and you'll find countless influencers touting weighted vests as the secret to building unbreakable bones and sculpted muscles. Many videos have gained hundreds of thousands of views with claims that weighted vests will \"transform your body\"—a claim that, to be fair, is par for the course in any fitness trend. \"Weighted vest walks\" are popular enough to be parodied, and even if I find those videos a little mean-spirited, they do point to an important question: Does this trendy fitness accessory actually deliver on its promises?Let's dig into what science really says about weighted vests—and what they can (and can't) do for your body.The claim: Weighted vests can build bone density or stop bone lossI can see how this theory sounds legit. Bones respond to mechanical stress by becoming stronger—it's why astronauts lose bone density in zero gravity, and why weight-bearing exercise is recommended for osteoporosis prevention. So logically, strapping on extra weight should signal your bones to bulk up, right? Not exactly.\nAccording to Dr. Leah Verebes, a professor at the Touro School of Health Science's DPT program, the reality is more nuanced. \"Some research, particularly among elderly persons and postmenopausal women, suggests that the use of a weighted vest while exercising, or plain walking, can slow bone loss or improve bone density modestly—especially in the legs and hips,\" she says.However, the gains are far from dramatic. Verebes notes that \"results are variable and gains are minimal.\" Traditional resistance training like weightlifting and higher-impact activities like jogging or jumping produce significantly better results. A 2023 review found that while weighted vests may help maintain bone mineral density, the overall quality of evidence supporting this benefit remains low to moderate.Weighted vests can help maintain bone strength, particularly for people who can't tolerate high-impact exercise due to joint issues or other limitations. But they're not a substitute for proper resistance training or impact activities.The claim: Wearing a weighted vest builds muscle and increases strength.Here's where expectations need serious adjustment. Yes, adding weight to your body does increase the resistance during bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and step-ups. And yes, this can contribute to improvements in muscular endurance and modest strength gains. But there's a catch.\"Vest walking also increases caloric expenditure and activates muscles more than regular walking, but the weight is typically too low to induce significant muscle growth,\" Verebes says. Most weighted vests are designed to be 5-15% of your body weight—enough to make your workout harder, but not enough to trigger substantial muscle building.Think of it this way: If you weigh 150 pounds, a 10% weighted vest adds just 15 pounds. That's less resistance than you'd use for a basic strength training exercise. \"Significant muscle growth continues to require progressive resistance training with more substantial weights,\" Verebes says.So, weighted vests can intensify your workout and improve muscular endurance, but they won't replace a proper strength training program if your goal is building significant muscle mass.The risks nobody's posting aboutWhile social media showcases people effortlessly crushing workouts in weighted vests, the reality is that adding load to your body comes with real risks. Verebes says that \"too much excess weight can cause strain on joints, especially the knees, hips, and lower back.\" The increased load can also impair balance and increase fall risk, a particular concern for older adults who might be using vests specifically to improve bone health.Perhaps most concerning is the risk of overuse injuries when people add weight too quickly. \"Professionals recommend starting with a light vest—roughly 5–10% body weight—and adding to it gradually as strength and tolerance improve,\" Verebes says.What actually works for building strong bones and musclesIf you're serious about improving your musculoskeletal health, Verebes offers evidence-based recommendations:Prioritize resistance training. Weightlifting or using resistance bands remain the most effective methods for keeping bones and muscles strong. Progressive overload—gradually increasing the weight you lift—is key to continued improvement.Include impact and weight-bearing exercise. Walking, hiking, stair climbing, and jumping all provide bone stimulation. Activities that involve impact force your bones to adapt and strengthen.Support exercise with proper nutrition. You can't out-train a poor diet. Adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D are essential for maintaining bone and muscle health. Without proper nutrition, even the best exercise program will fall short.So, should you use a weighted vest?Look, weighted vests aren't worthless. They can add challenge to bodyweight exercises and walking routines, providing modest improvements in muscle endurance and bone maintenance, particularly for older adults or those unable to do high-impact activities.But as Verebes says, \"they are not a shortcut to get to stronger bones and bigger muscles overnight. For significant improvements, regular resistance training and impact exercise remain the gold standard.\"The bottom line? Weighted vests are a tool, not a miracle solution. If you do decide to try a weighted vest, start conservatively with 5-10% of your body weight, add load gradually, and pay attention to how your joints respond. And crucially: Always speak with your doctor first, especially if you have existing joint problems, balance issues, or bone density concerns.\n            ",

I don’t care whether you celebrate with a drunken costume party, pumpkin carving, door-to-door candy begging, or a more personal observance like watching horror movies alone, but respect must be paid to the awesomest of all holidays. But where did Halloween come from, and how did it end up like the modern holiday we now celebrate?The origins of Halloween are surprisingly slippery. Oct. 31 is next door to a Christian religious holiday, and it's  around \"harvest time,\" which might generally explain the date, but no one really knows why we put on costumes and beg for candy. There are a ton of theories describing how modern Halloween practices could have sprung from various ancient traditions, religious rites, or folk practices, but the first direct evidence of anything resembling modern \"Halloween\" is no older than the 1800s, and even then, it didn't really take off for another 100 years. Put succinctly, the history of Halloween as we know it is a muddy, confusing collection of practices that probably owe more to Peanuts comics published in the 1950s than Medieval Catholicism or pagan rites.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe theoretical history of HalloweenThe most commonly repeated Halloween origin story says that the holiday began with the Samhain (pronounced sah-win or sow-in) celebrations of the Celts in Ireland, England, and Northern France. The date of Nov. 1 or Oct. 31 is about halfway between the autumnal equinox and winter solstice, and ninth century Irish literature describes gatherings and feasts marking Samhain, the day when ancient burial mounds were opened, and with them, portals to the Otherworld, the land of the Gods and the dead. Later, the theory goes, these practices were Christianized, renamed “All Hallow’s Day” and “All Hallow’s Eve” by the early Church, and that’s where we get Halloween. Sounds plausible enough......but it's probably not what happened. The idea that Halloween comes from pagan rituals usurped by Christians originated with Welsh scholar Sir John Rhŷs, and he didn’t back up his theory with a ton of evidence. Some modern historians maintain that ties between Celtic celebrations and early Christian practices are tenuous, and medieval Christian festivals provide the real blueprint for the holiday. Medieval Christians celebrated All Saints' and All Souls days during the observance of Allhallowtide—the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead—by holding community feasts, emphasizing dead souls, and decorating skeletons. But they didn't get that from the Celts, or so the theory goes.Either way, both All Souls Day and Samhain likely have roots that go deeper than written history records. Harvest festivals were common in many places, and maybe they were like Halloween parties, but maybe they weren't. We don't know. The holiday takes place at the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time between life and death, when both Pagan and Christian minds turn toward the inevitable end of things. Halloween traditions seem to pay homage to that \"between\" place, and while we don't know how much about how ancients celebrated \"halfway between solstice and equinox day,\" it probably wasn't by dressing up and begging for treats. Verified Halloween historyNo matter where it started, by 835 AD, All Saints Day (Nov. 1) became an official Catholic day of obligation, and Allhallowtide practices like ringing church bells for souls in purgatory and black-clad criers taking to the streets to remind people to think of the dead are a little Halloween-like. If you squint.Another tradition of the time was baking “soul cakes” in memory of the dead. This led to “souling,” where groups of children traveled from house to house asking for cakes in exchange for praying for the dead. Later soulers would carry carved lanterns made of hollowed-out turnips too. Is this the origin of “trick or treating” and Jack o’ Lanterns? Maybe...but again, probably not. It doesn’t seem like souling children wore costumes, even though “guising” or “mumming” (dressing in costumes and bothering your neighbors for treats and/or money) was practiced in various places in Europe during other holidays, particularly around Christmas.Another theory for the origin of costumes for Halloween originates with the Late Medieval French tradition of the Danse Macabre—the dance of death. Perhaps in response to the Black Plague ravaging Europe, 14th century artists would depict the personification of Death surrounded by figures of a pope, an emperor, a king, a child, and a laborer—people from all levels of society—dancing toward the grave. Live versions of the Danse Macabre were enacted at village pageants, no doubt to the delight and horror of all. The grotesque but comical performance reminded people that Death would come for everyone, but also that we should have as much fun as possible before the inevitable, and there’s nothing more “Halloween” than that. But again, this is only a theory. The origins of Halloween in AmericaIn colonial America, Halloween was not widely observed. While New England Puritans generally frowned on anything fun like wearing costumes, dancing with Death, or carving pumpkins, more liberal colonists in New York, Maryland, and further south may have brought some Halloween-like activities over the ocean from their villages in Germany or Ireland. We don't really know, but other than for a few pockets of diehards, maybe, celebrating Halloween wasn't a thing in either the U.S. or Europe before the late 1800s.The earliest American expression of Halloween-like activities performed in late October or early November came in the form of “play parties,” or Autumn festivals, to celebrate the harvest. These gatherings, immortalized in Washington Irving's horror tale The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, often included ghost stories, attempts at divination, apple bobbing, pranks, and attempts to scare people—proto-Halloween activities, where you can see the holiday taking shape. It wasn’t until the Irish mass immigration of the 19th century that we see Halloween celebrations labeled as such. Beginning around the 1850s, Irish immigrants fleeing the Potato Famine descended on the country. These immigrants brought Halloween celebrations to the U.S., but it doesn’t seem like they brought Halloween costumes or trick-or-treating. The possible origins of trick-or-treatingAll of our modern ideas that Halloween traditions came from this or that ancient practice could be examples of cherry-picking data to support the conclusion that our modern Halloween traditions have a deep lineage in the first place. But what if they don't? Trick-or-treating is the most well-known expression of Halloween, but, despite historic examples of costume-clad holiday revelers and/or people going to door to door to beg for treats on holidays, there doesn't seem to be a direct link between any these older practices and modern trick or treating. Yes, it's a little like souling, but no one in America seems to have ever practiced souling. There's no evidence of anyone wearing costumes for Halloween in the U.S., the U.K., or Ireland before 1900 either, leading some Halloween scholars to suggest that American children developed trick-or-treating and costume-wearing independently of any older tradition. Which is actually the coolest theory: American kids made up Halloween from scratch.The first mention of Halloween candy collection in costume comes from a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario in 1911, but the practice remained obscure enough that there’s no mention of anything like it in Ruth Edna Kelley's 1919 history of the holiday, The Book of Hallowe’en, and there are no trick-or-treaters depicted in any of the many Halloween postcards printed in the 1920s. The practice doesn’t seem to have been widespread until the late 1930s, when the first mentions of it appears in a national publication, and it didn’t really take off until the early '50s, when it appeared in a Peanuts comic strip and a Disney cartoon. From there, everything we call \"Halloween\" comes into focus: The ghosts, the parties, the scares, the candy, all evolving from comic strips, movies, candy company advertising campaigns, and regular folks who seem to really enjoy dressing up in costumes.Halloween: The people's holidayWe ultimately don’t know much about the origin of Halloween because its meaning, and how we celebrate it, change constantly—it used to be a day for parties celebrating the harvest, during which people would read each other's fortunes; then it became a day for kids to go trick or treating; then adults started using it as an excuse to dress in sexy Martha Washington costumes and get drunk. Parents got a freaked about razorblades in candy and invent \"trunk-or-treating;\" overly ambitious suburbanites started turning their homes into elaborate spook-houses; and on and on. No ancient pagan ritual needed, just folks figuring out what works for them. Many other major holidays are rooted in religion or meant to commemorate a specific historical event—they’re top-down holidays, where the Pope or the government decreed that everyone would get a day off on this specific date, and observe it in this specific way. But Halloween is the people's holiday, so there's no official list of rules telling us how we're supposed to commemorate it, or even any reason why we should be celebrating it. But every year we do anyway, perhaps due to a collective desire to get some candy or do something witchy before it gets too cold to go outside. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Strava has voluntarily dropped its (frankly baffling) lawsuit against fellow fitness giant Garmin. Strava's filing today is incredibly brief—just a single line, with no filings or responses from Garmin since the case began 21 days ago. The original lawsuit demanded that Garmin cease selling all of its fitness watches and cycling computers, claiming patent infringement on two core features—segments and heatmaps—and alleges that Garmin violated a decade-old cooperation agreement between the two companies. Here's the thing: Garmin almost never loses patent battles. And today's news continues that trend. Considering that Garmin is Strava’s most important partner, where does leave the two companies now?What was Strava's lawsuit even about?According to Strava's Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar, the lawsuit was meant to take action against Garmin's plan to cut off API access unless Strava plasters the Garmin logo across virtually every part of its platform. What that looked like practically was Strava targeting two main patent claims. \nThe first involves heatmaps and popularity routing, covered by patents filed in December 2014 and issued in 2016. These patents describe technology for generating maps that show where users work out based on aggregated GPS data from multiple users. This first claim is pretty clear-cut, but before diving into that, know that the second patent focuses on a different signature feature: segments. This patent, filed in March 2011 and granted in August 2015, covers the concept of user-defined route segments where athletes can compete for best times using GPS data.For more context, the timing of this suit comes on the heels of recent friction between the companies. In 2024, Strava implemented controversial API changes that disrupted many third-party fitness apps. Around the same time, Garmin began requiring API partners to provide attribution for data sourced from Garmin Connect—a policy Strava reportedly resisted.Additionally, Garmin launched its Trails+ feature in May 2025 as part of a paid Garmin Connect+ subscription, which Strava may view as encroachment on its subscription-based revenue model. According to DC Rainmaker's sources, Strava formally notified Garmin of the patent concerns in late June 2025, with a follow-up in July. Why was the lawsuit so short-lived?Backing up a little, it's worth noting here that Strava and Garmin's relationship has been close for over a decade. As trusted fitness tech blogger DC Rainmaker explains, Garmin introduced its own segments feature back in June 2014, before partnering with Strava to implement \"Strava Live Segments\" on Garmin devices in July 2015 through a Master Cooperation Agreement. Strava now claims that Garmin expanded beyond the scope of that agreement by continuing to develop and deploy its own Garmin-branded segments alongside Strava's features. Notably, this alleged infringement has been ongoing for approximately 10 years.This was an uphill battle for Strava from the jump. Perhaps most damaging to Strava's case was the timeline issue, particularly regarding heatmaps. According to DC Rainmaker's research, Garmin actually introduced heatmaps in Garmin Connect in early 2013—more than a year and a half before Strava filed its patent application in December 2014. Multiple other platforms, including third-party developers using Strava's own API data, had also created heatmap functionality during this period.\"The fact that they got a patent for it is a testament to how messy software patents have been over the years,\" DC Rainmaker observes. Garmin's lawyers could easily argue this patent shouldn't have been granted  in the first place, similar to when Wahoo sued Zwift and quickly dropped the suit after a judge questioned the validity of their patents.Today there's a good bit speculation about what exactly went down behind the scenes. What we can see is that Strava made a gross miscalculation about how much Garmin would fold; Strava's legal arguments were shaky at best, and in targeting Garmin, the company decided to target its single biggest and closest partner—one with a formidably victorious track record. It was high-risk, and most likely not at all worth it. What happens now?In the last two weeks, we’ve already seen Garmin announce new integrations with Komoot (a Strava competitor). Time will tell if Strava just botched its most important relationship, and what that could mean for users. For now, users of both platforms can continue using their devices and syncing data as usual. But the lawsuit debacle highlights growing tensions in the fitness tech ecosystem, as companies increasingly compete not just for users, but control over all the data and features that athletes have come to rely on.\n            ",

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        To the disappointment of Judgment Day fans, The Rapture did not happen as predicted at the end of September, but keep your fingers crossed for November, when aliens are expected to invade. This one's a way more concrete prediction than the Rapture. Unlike Jesus, we can actually see the alien starship in our telescopes, cleverly disguised as an interstellar comet. And it's not just conspiracy theorists or Joe Rogan Podcast guests sounding the alarm—a Harvard astrophysicist kicked off the whole thing. So hold on to your butt!The ballad of 3I/ATLASBack in July, NASA spotted 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet about the size of Manhattan, passing through our solar system on its journey from God knows where. This is only the third interstellar comet we've ever spotted, so it's a big deal. In September, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb (who had a long, legit career until recently) published \"News on 3I/ATLAS: Lack of Non-Gravitational Acceleration Implies an Anomalously Massive Object\" which posits that the comet could be a giant spaceship that is going to fly behind the Sun on Oct. 21 (hey, that's the day I'm posting this!), and while it's shielded from our view, the \"potentially hostile\" comet/spaceship could do all kinds of aerial maneuvers, release a squadron of X-wings, or really anything. Then he appeared on a bunch of podcasts and news shows to talk about his \"it could be aliens!\" idea and it spread in mainstream press.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe cranks took over from there, connecting Loeb's observations with the prophecies of \"Baba Vanga\" (a blind, Bulgarian fortune teller that cuckoos love), lies about NASA, Loeb's own invocation of the \"Dark Forest\" theory (where hostile aliens lurk silently waiting to strike), and everything else you could image, then they used AI to make videos about the invasion. So many AI videos about the invasion. So are aliens landing in November?I wouldn't bet on it. If you read Loeb's papers or listen to interviews with him, it's clear he's careful to never make any predictions. He says things like 3I/Atlas \"could be on a mission to release mini probes meant to invade Earth,\" or \"If it’s a technological object, then it might maneuver itself.\" Oh, it could be on mission? It might do something? I could be about to grow 17 heads, and I might release mini probes too. Loeb is not wrong, technically, nor is he lying, but he's not being entirely honest either, because he doesn't follow up his statements with \"...but it's so unlikely, it's barely worth considering.\"And this isn't the first time he's done this.What's the deal with Avi Loeb?Remember 1I/ʻOumuamua? That cigar-shaped interstellar object people thought was an extraterrestrial probe in 2017? Loeb started that, too. He co-authored a paper suggesting it could be a lightsail—a thin, artificial sheet propelled by starlight—sent by an alien civilization. A possibility, but surprise! it turned out to be a comet. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThen there was the meteor. In 2022, Loeb claimed that a meteor that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in 2014 was interstellar in origin and possibly technological. He  dredged up fragments from the ocean floor, and held press conferences about the \"spherules\" that might be alien technology. After sighing heavily, other scientists responded with: \"Sure, it might be alien technology, but it isn't,\" and I hope they added, \"why don't we put some money on the next 'space probe?'\"It's a pattern: Loeb makes a qualified outrageous claim, gets the headlines (\"Harvard Scientist: Comet Could Be Alien Spaceship!\") while hedging enough to say \"I never said it was aliens\" when the prediction fizzles. He seems to be trying to raise awareness about how we think about extraterrestrial life and push against the knee-jerk scientific dismissal of the subject, but the way he's doing it is questionable.Science isn't sexy enoughIn 2025, \"We should carefully study this unusual object\" doesn't land you a book contract and media blitz like \"Could this be an alien invasion fleet?\" does, but it also doesn't corrode public trust in science, and legitimate scientists studying interstellar objects, searching for biosignatures, and working on SETI get drowned out by the noise. And what happens in November? Our Venusian Sky Brothers might descend upon Earth with cake and ice cream for all, but I'm putting my money on the cranks moving on to flat-Earth theories or weather machines, while Loeb generates headlines in a few months with another \"this time, it really might be aliens!\" object. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I've been providing administrative help to my partner as he opens a new business, managing professional expansions of my own, studying for a certification exam, overseeing renovations to my apartment, and restructuring my finances while still keeping up with my regular jobs and responsibilities. For a while, I was waking up tired before the day even started despite the fact that most of these boil down to never-ending, tedious, but little tasks like \"send that email,\" \"return that phone call,\" \"confirm that account number,\" and \"pick a paint color.\" I'm convinced it's actually those smaller tasks that burn you out. If every day were one where I was taking a big swing and doing something that felt monumental, I wouldn't be procrastinating as much as I am. Well, as much as I was. I started falling back on my old friend, the \"two-minute rule,\" and the procrastination I was dealing with a few weeks ago came to a quick halt. I am certain you're busy and overwhelmed, too, so here's how this simple rule works and what it can do for you at times when you feel like you have so much to do that you can't functionally do any of it.What’s the two minute rule?The two minute rule came from David Allen, author of Getting Things Done. The idea is simple: If you can get something done in two minutes, just do it. Don’t think it over. Don’t ponder whether it’s more or less important than the heavier lifts you have to do. If it takes two minutes or less to get done, just do it right now.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDoing tasks when they’re still small potatoes stops them from snowballing into bigger projects—the kind that take longer than two minutes. For instance, it takes you less than two minutes to clean the dishes after a single meal. If you let them pile up every time you eat, it’ll take longer when you finally have to do it, and you’re more likely to procrastinate knowing that it’s going to be a time-suck.Getting a bunch of minor tasks knocked off your to-do list builds momentum: With several smaller responsibilities taken care of, you’re likely to feel more capable of diving into deeper work. This method is similar to the idea of “eating the frog” in that way, although there are notable differences. When you practice “eating the frog,” you knock out your biggest responsibility first; when you use the two-minute rule, you do the opposite. Which you choose depends on the type of work you have and your personal preference, but both result in a feeling of accomplishment that can propel you through the rest of your workload.How to use the two minute rule effectivelyUnlike eating the frog, the two minute rule isn’t specific about getting your task done right away when you wake up. Rather, it encourages you to do any simple task the moment it occurs to you. Think of the things that lead you to procrastinate in a regular day. For me, it’s responding to emails: I see emails come in but don’t reply right away, even though that would take me a few seconds. Eventually, I have to respond, but with the added weight of expressing remorse for my untimely reply on top of addressing whatever the original message was about. In worst-case scenarios, the event or need the original email was expressing has evolved, too, because I didn't take care of it right away. Then, I have to deal with a situation that is worse or more urgent than it was when the email first came in.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI've been two-minute ruling my emails consistently for the past few weeks, and it's helped me in a number of ways. First, I just feel better and like I have less of a weight on me if I reply, \"Thanks, I got this. I'll check it out and get back to you.\" Even just acknowledging the message is forward progress. Second, it's stopped people from having to send follow-ups or attempting to work on something without my approval or input, possibly doing it in a way I don't prefer or isn't helpful to my goals. This goes beyond emails, of course; that's just the example of the small tasks that bog down my life. For what it's worth, I think it's valuable to get a little abstract with the \"two-minute\" idea, but not too abstract. For instance, if your gas tank is on 25%, it will take longer than two minutes to pull off and fill it up, sure, but that's still a small, quick task that needs to get done. The other benefit here is you stop fretting over everything and wasting so much time. I had to select a wallpaper color the other day and I was dragging that out, exemplifying Parkinson's Law, which states, \"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\" I called on my two-minute rule, made a firm decision instead of continuing to deliberate, and got the wallpaper the next day. Now it's up and I can move on to other things.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

On Tuesday, the company announced Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration. At the moment, it's Mac-only, but I wouldn't recommend even my Apple friends jumping on board immediately—at least not without understanding the underlying risks. Atlas' AI web browsing\nIf you've already used other AI browsers, like Perplexity's Comet, Atlas is going to feel familiar. In fact, that's also likely true if you've used any web browser before: Atlas is built on Chromium, the engine that powers browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. That means the core mechanics of Atlas are fairly standard; there's nothing particularly revolutionary happening here when it comes to sorting tabs or the browsing experience itself. The same is true when it comes to some ChatGPT interactions. As with other AI browsers, ChatGPT is assigned to the sidebar of the browser window. You can call it up by clicking on the \"Ask ChatGPT\" button, where you can ask it questions about the content you're currently browsing. You can also ask ChatGPT for writing assistance any time you enter an open text field in the browser. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLike Comet, Atlas has an agent mode, but the latter's is built off the existing ChatGPT agent. The idea is that you can task Atlas with performing functions on your behalf. So, rather than pulling up DoorDash's website and ordering yourself dinner, you could ask Atlas to order dinner for you. You can even watch Atlas get to work, and see its thinking behind each decision. OpenAI has other ideas for how to use Atlas' agent mode, including giving the browser a recipe to shop for, or asking the bot to run through team documents at work to generate a brief. Deeper ChatGPT integration is what might set Atlas apart from the competition. If you're a regular ChatGPT user, you'll probably appreciate it having that contextual awareness of your past conversations—if you've already asked ChatGPT about a topic, and you're currently researching it in a browser window, you can pick up the conversation and assume ChatGPT will remember what you've already talked about.        \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAi\n                    \n    \nSimilarly, Atlas will track your browsing and activity history and call upon it in future sessions. Perhaps you'll open your browser to find personalized suggestions on which sites and topics to explore next. Does that sound creepy? Absolutely. But if you're someone who doesn't mind the privacy trade-off, there could be some benefits there. In OpenAI's announcement, it suggested asking Atlas to pull up all the job postings you looked at last week, and produce a summary of industry trends to use in interview prep. If you find that these memories are a bit too much for you, you can disable them from the browser settings. (OpenAI says deleting your browsing history also deletes associated browser memories, and the browser's incognito window logs you out of ChatGPT.)The company includes a setting called \"ChatGPT page visibility,\" which lets you control whether ChatGPT can actually see the webpage you're visiting. If you choose \"Not Allowed,\" you can block the bot from seeing what you're doing, which is good. But then again, doing that defeats the purpose of Atlas a bit. If you don't want ChatGPT seeing what you're doing, you might as well use a browser that doesn't have ChatGPT built right into it. (The company does promise it won't train ChatGPT on your browsing data unless you opt into it, but why would you do that?)Is Atlas safe to use?\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nI'm of the opinion that if the safety of a browser is in question, it's best not to bother with. That's the case with Atlas, as well as other AI browsers. The main issue with browsers that incorporate AI agents is that they are susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks. Brave has done a lot of research on this subject, particularly with Comet. In short, bad actors can potentially hide malicious instructions on websites that the AI agents see as no different from a typical user request. Because the browser is designed to act on your behalf, these malicious instructions can command the AI to do things you definitely don't want it to do. You might ask Atlas to summarize a webpage, but because a bad actor hid a command to do something involving your email, bank account, or corporate intranet on the site, it does that instead. To OpenAI's credit, the company has compiled a list of safeguards to mitigate risks with Atlas. Atlas cannot run code directly in the browser, nor can it download files or install extensions. The browser has no way to access other apps on your Mac, nor its file system. If agent mode needs to access sensitive sites, like your bank, it'll pause to make sure \"you're watching.\" To that point, you can use Atlas' agent in logged out mode, which limits its ability to access sensitive data or take actions \"as you\" on websites. But even OpenAI admits that after thousands of hours of testing, their safeguards \"will not stop every attack that emerges as AI agents grow in popularity.\" The company says it'll patch new vulnerabilities as it finds them, but if bad actors find them first, they might trick these AI agents into doing some terrible things.To me, the risks currently far outweigh the benefits. I don't yet see much reason to have a bot in my browser do things on my behalf, but even if I did, I wouldn't use it just yet. The risk that someone injects a website with a malicious command and derails my AI agent—and my digital life—is too great, especially when I can book those flights or order that delivery on my own without issue.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

Researchers at security firm LayerX have analyzed multiple campaigns in recent months involving malicious browser extensions, including the widespread GhostPoster scheme targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs. Fake Chrome extensions look like popular AI assistantsThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior. Though the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update. \nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

There’s something about unpleasant bodily experiences that makes us think they must be good for us, somehow, and so the sauna has gained a healthful reputation that it doesn’t entirely deserve. Here’s a rundown of what a sauna can and can’t do for you.Saunas don’t burn fatIt is technically true that you can lose weight by sitting in a sauna, but that’s not because your body is torching fat; it’s because you’re sweating, and sweat is made of water, and water weighs something. As soon as you rehydrate—which you should—the scale will go right back to where it was at the beginning. After all, as I've discussed in the context of exercise, sweating doesn’t mean that you got a good workout or that you burned calories. It just means you were hot. People who sell saunas and sauna services like to talk up their calorie-burning benefits, but there’s no evidence to suggest you burn significantly more calories sitting in a hot room than you would sitting on your couch at home. Some more skeptical websites cite a modest figure of 1.5 to 2 times as many calories as you would burn sitting at room temperature, but without a citation. If true, that’s about the same as the difference between sitting and standing—so you can skip that trip to the sauna and just spend half an hour standing around. So why does your fitness tracker say you burned a ton of calories in the sauna? First of all, don't bring your phone in the sauna, it's bad for the battery. But since you did anyway, I'll explain. The calorie-burning algorithms on your watch are built to estimate your calorie burn from your heart rate under the assumption that you are exercising. If your heart rate increases but you are not exercising, the calculations aren't correct. The calorie burn during exercise comes from the fact that muscles all over your body are contracting over and over again. That is simply not what's happening when you sit in the sauna. Saunas don’t “detox” youIt’s 2026 and we as a society should be over this “detox” concept, which has been debunked time and time again. Ordinary inconveniences like being tired sometimes aren’t due to some secret toxins that are constantly poisoning you, and even if you do have health issues due to toxins, you should seek medical treatment and not expect smoothies or saunas to cure you.Saunas don’t replace exerciseSaunas and exercise both heat up your body and make you sweat, but there aren’t many similarities aside from that. Remember, exercise makes us stronger and improves our cardiovascular endurance (giving us a higher VO2max, for example). Sweating in a hot room doesn’t do that. Even this rundown from an exercise science researcher, whose headline draws parallels between running and sitting in a sauna, includes the following disclaimer: \"Before you contemplate cancelling your gym membership and investing the savings in a Jacuzzi, know that regular saunas or baths are unable to replicate all the health benefits of exercise training, such as promoting fat loss and increasing muscle mass. Using hot baths or saunas shouldn’t be considered as a substitute for exercise.\"Saunas may be good for your blood vesselsWhat that researcher does point out, after the disclaimer, is that there are a few lesser-known benefits of exercise that seem to be related to the increase in body heat and heart rate, rather than from the more obvious strain on our lungs or muscles. When your body temperature rises, blood vessels near the surface of your skin dilate (get wider) and this process may help cell growth and repair. In other words, simply raising body temperature may be good for your blood vessels. That's not something we normally think about, but healthy blood vessels are a part of a healthy cardiovascular system. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRelaxation is realIf you find saunas relaxing—and many of us do—that can be a health benefit in itself. Now, this isn’t as concrete a benefit as it’s sometimes made out to be. You’re not going to cure your depression or reverse your heart disease just by relaxing in a sauna every now and then. But if you enjoy your sauna sessions, they could certainly contribute to lowering your stress levels and improving your mental health. Pro tip: If you don't have access to a sauna, a hot bath may have a lot of these effects as well.Heat has its pros and consFor other medical conditions and athletic uses, the pros and cons of a sauna come down to the pros and cons of heat itself. If you have sore muscles, heat often feels good, so athletes often enjoy sauna sessions. Some skin conditions respond well to the dry air of a sauna, while others can be exacerbated by dry air but could feel better with the humid air of a steam room. Use common sense and check with your medical provider if you want to use a sauna to manage a health condition. Saunas have risks, tooIf we’re talking about health benefits, it’s only fair to discuss risks as well. Saunas are reasonably safe, but people with medical conditions are often advised to steer clear, or to talk to a doctor before deciding to spend time in a sauna. This may include you if you are pregnant, have unusually high or low blood pressure, have epilepsy, or are taking stimulants, tranquilizers, or mind-altering drugs. Spending time in a sauna has also been linked to temporarily lowered fertility because heat impairs the production of sperm. The main danger of a sauna is that you could overheat or dehydrate; severe heat illness and dehydration can both be life threatening, and people have died in saunas. Alcohol makes you more susceptible; half of the people who died in saunas, according to a Finnish study, were under the influence of alcohol. (The authors argue that the biggest danger is not alcohol itself, but allowing a drunk person to be in a sauna alone.) So if you choose to spend time in a sauna, be smart about it. Hydrate well, don’t go alone, and don’t expect the sauna to do things that saunas can’t do. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The Amazon-owned company aired an ad on Super Bowl Sunday for \"Search Party,\" its new feature that turns a neighborhood's collective Ring cameras into one network, with the goal of locating lost dogs. Viewers, however, saw this as a major privacy violation—it doesn't take much to imagine using this type of surveillance tech to locate people, not pets.The backlash wasn't just isolated to the ad, however. The controversy reignited criticisms of the company's partnership with Flock Safety, a security company that sells security cameras that track vehicles, notably for license plate recognition. But the partnership with Ring wasn't about tracking vehicles: Instead, Flock Safety's role was to make it easier for law enforcement agencies that use Flock Safety software to request Ring camera footage from users. Agencies could put in a request to an area where a crime supposedly took place, and Ring users would be notified about the request. They didn't have to agree to share footage, however. Law enforcement could already request footage from Ring users, through the platform's existing \"Community Requests\" feature. But this partnership would let agencies make these requests directly through Flock Safety's software. If a user submitted footage following a request, Ring said that data would be \"securely packaged\" by Flock Safety and share to the agency through FlockOS or Flock Nova.\nThat partnership is officially over. On Friday, Ring published a blog post announcing the end of its relationship with Flock Safety. The company said, after a review, the integration \"would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.\" As such, both parties have agree to cancel the partnership. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nImportantly, Ring says that since the integration never actually launched, no user footage was ever sent to Flock Safety—despite the company announcing the partnership four months ago. Social media influencers had spread the false claim that Flock Safety was seeding Ring footage directly to law enforcement agencies, such as ICE. While those claims are inaccurate, they were likely fueled by reporting from 404 Media that ICE has been able to access Flock Safety's data in its investigations. Had Ring's partnership with Flock Safety gone ahead, there would be legitimate cause to believe that agencies like ICE could tap into the footage Ring users had shared—even if those users were under the impression they were only sharing footage with local agencies to solve specific cases.  While privacy advocates will likely celebrate this news, the cancelled partnership has no effect on Community Requests. Law enforcement agencies will still be able to request footage from Ring users, and those users will still have a say in whether or not they send that footage. Ring sees the feature as an objective good, allowing users to voluntarily share footage that could help law enforcement solve important cases. In its announcement on Friday, Ring cited the December 2025 Brown University shooting, in which seven users shared 168 video clips with law enforcement. According to Ring, one of those videos assisted police in identifying the suspect's car, which, in turn, solved the case.    \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

YouTube for Vision OS is a free, standalone app that lets users log into their existing YouTube accounts through their Vision headsets and stream videos like they would expect to, including standard videos, 180° videos, 360° videos, and YouTube Shorts. Vision Pro M5 users can stream 8K videos, and premium YouTube members can download videos directly to their headsets, a must for long flights.  Google, YouTube's parent company, has apparently been working on the app for a while. In 2024, a spokesperson confirmed that a standalone Vision Pro app was \"on our roadmap,\" but until today, the only way Vision users could watch YouTube on their headsets was through the Safari web browser. The new YouTube app is designed to fit into Vision's spatial computing environments. \"Rather than just responding to different screen sizes, we needed something that responds to different spaces, volumes and use cases,\" YouTube's senior UX designer Brendan Polley told Apple. \"We built an entirely new design system that isolated core elements—comments, the play button, 'like' and 'dislike'—to fit any layout.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHaving downloaded the app, it works exactly as intended. If you're looking for something that demonstrates Vision Pro's immersive video capabilities, you should check out the just-released 360° videos from the Milano Cortina winter Olympics on NBC's channel.

This latest \"Patch Tuesday\" fixes 58 vulnerabilities in total, six of which are zero-day flaws. As a reminder, a zero-day is a vulnerability that has been either actively exploited in the wild or publicly disclosed before an official fix is released by the developer. As BleepingComputer reports, security flaws were found in the following categories: 25 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, five security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 12 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, six information disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial of service vulnerabilities, and seven spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities and two of the information disclosure vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" (These numbers do not include the three Microsoft Edge vulnerabilities patched earlier in February.)Patch Tuesday updates are typically released around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of every month, and your device should receive them automatically. BleepingComputer reports that this month's release also includes Secure Boot certificate updates for 2011 certificates that are expiring in June. \nSix zero-days patched in FebruaryThree of the six actively exploited zero-days fixed in February are security feature bypass vulnerabilities: CVE-2026-21510: This is a flaw the Windows Shell that allows an attacker to execute content without warning or gaining user consent, though the user does need to open a malicious link or shortcut file. CVE-2026-21513: This MSHTML Framework vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network. Microsoft has not released details on how this flaw was exploited. CVE-2026-21514: This vulnerability in Microsoft Word allows an attacker to bypasses OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office once a user has opened a malicious Office file. All three of the above flaws have been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), Office Product Group Security Team, and Google Threat Intelligence Group along with an anonymous researcher for CVE-2026-21510 and CVE-2026-21514.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo of the zero-days are elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. CVE-2026-21519 is a Desktop Windows Manager flaw that allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges, while CVE-2026-21533 is a Windows Remote Desktop Services flaw that allows an attacker to elevate privileges locally. The former has been attributed to MSTIC and MSRC, while the latter was discovered by the Advanced Research Team at CrowdStrike.Finally, CVE-2026-21525 is a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager that allows an unauthorized attacker to deny service locally. This flaw was discovered by the ACROS Security team with 0patch—it was reportedly found in a public malware repository in December 2025. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Following the 2023 credential-stuffing attack, 23AndMe in 2024 agreed to a $30–$50 million payout for impacted consumers. The genetic testing company then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2025 (introducing new privacy concerns around the potential sale of customer data).  The courts approved the deal last month, and class members have until Feb. 17 to submit claims related to the cyber incident. How much you'll receive from the 23andMe settlementThere are several tiers of payouts with the 23andMe settlement. Users with an \"extraordinary claim\"—those who experienced identity theft or fraudulent tax filings as a result of the breach—could qualify for up to $10,000 to reimburse verified expenses, including costs for physical or cyber security systems as well as mental health treatment. Claimants who received notices that certain health information was leaked in the breach will be paid up to $165. Eligible data include raw genotype data, health reports (including health predisposition reports, wellness reports, and carrier status reports), and self-reported health conditions. Individuals residing in Alaska, California, Illinois, and Oregon will receive an additional $100 thanks to state privacy laws. Note that payments will likely take time to be distributed. \nThe settlement also provides for five years of identity monitoring services through a customized program called Privacy & Medical Shield + Genetic Monitoring. This is available to all class members regardless of payout.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to file a 23andMe claimConsumers who were impacted by the 2023 data breach can file a Cyber Security Incident Claim, which must be submitted by Feb. 17, 2026 (unless you received a notice in 2026 indicating otherwise). To be eligible, you must have been a 23andMe customer between May 1, 2023 and October 1, 2023 and have received a notice (via letter or email) that your information was compromised in the breach. You also must attest that you incurred damages (monetary or non-monetary) as a result of the incident. Claims can be filed online via the settlement website, or you can mail a hard copy of your claim form (postmarked by Feb. 17) to the address listed. To complete a claim, you must provide some personal information as well as details about the harm incurred with supporting documentation, such as bank or credit card statements substantiating losses. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The app has over three billion monthly active users, constantly messaging and calling one another across the globe. However, currently those calls are all happening over the mobile app, or maybe the desktop app. Though WhatsApp does have a web app, the service has never supported audio or video calls outside of its downloadable apps—until now. You can now make calls from the WhatsApp web appAccording to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is slowly rolling out audio and video calls to its web app. At launch, the functionality is coming to individual chats with users who elect to enroll in the WhatsApp web app's beta, but the company plans to roll out the feature to all web app users over the coming weeks.WABetaInfo notes that voice and audio calls work about the same as they do in the WhatsApp desktop app. When you open an individual chat in the web app, you'll now see a video call icon at the top. Click this, and you'll find two options: one to place a voice call, and one to place a video call. These calls are still end-to-end encrypted, as they are on WhatsApp's desktop and mobile apps, meaning only the users who are a part of the calls can hear what's being said. In addition, the web app's video call client supports Screen Share, so you can share a live stream of your computer's screen to another WhatsApp contact. \nWhatsApp is also reportedly working on group chat calls for web app users, as well. While that feature won't roll out alongside individual calls, when it does launch, you'll be able to join group chats with up to 32 people. If you tend to use the WhatsApp desktop or mobile apps, this might not seem like huge news—but it is pretty substantial for a few subsets of WhatsApp users. One, of course, is the user base that just prefers using WhatsApp in their computer's web browser—but the other is Linux users. WhatsApp doesn't actually offer a version of its desktop app for Linux, so those users have to use the web app if they want to run WhatsApp on their computers. That means they've never before been able to place calls without pulling out a mobile device.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sign up for the WhatsApp web app betaThis feature will soon roll out to all web app users, but until then, you need to be running the WhatsApp web app beta in order to try it.Luckily, it's pretty easy to get up and running. To start, open the web app, then head to the settings menu, choose \"Help,\" then choose the \"Join beta\" option. This will immediately switch you over to the beta version of the web app. (You should see a \"Beta\" label on your screen.) Now that you're running the beta, should you find the option to place calls in individual chats. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

A new spyware platform known as ZeroDayRAT is reportedly being sold on Telegram, complete with customer support and updates. According to mobile security company iVerify, this aggressive spyware grants full remote control over devices running Android 15 through 16 and iOS versions up to iOS 26. Once deployed, it allows everything from user profiling and location tracking to live surveillance and financial theft. What ZeroDayRAT can gather from your deviceThis spyware has wide-ranging capabilities that, according to iVerify, have traditionally been found on platforms sponsored by state actors. Here's a look at what ZeroDayRAT can do: \nCollect information about the device, such as model, OS, battery, country, lock status, SIM and carrier info, app usage, live activity, and SMS message previews. This allows threat actors to develop user profiles for further targeting.Pull GPS coordinates, capture notifications from apps and systems, and harvest account information, such as usernames and emails. Send SMS messages and receive verification codes to bypass two-factor authentication. Log keystrokes (including biometric unlocks, gestures, and app launches), access the camera and microphone, and screen record.  Log crypto wallet addresses and target banking and payment app credentials via overlay attacks. How to protect against spywareZeroDayRAT can infect your device only if a malicious binary—an APK on Android or iOS payload—is downloaded and installed. These may be distributed through phishing, such as links sent via emails, texts, or messaging platforms, as well as in fake app stores. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll standard guidance for avoiding scams and malware applies: never click links in unsolicited communication, including conversations in apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, and only download apps and extensions from official, trusted sources. Users at high risk of being targeted and anyone who wants an extra layer of security can consider enabling Lockdown Mode (iOS) or Advanced Protection (Android). \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The first lets users request that Google remove sensitive government ID information from Search, while the second gives users new tools to request the same for non-consensual explicit images. Google's \"Results about you\" tool is getting an update\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nFirst, Google is updating its existing \"Results about you\" tool, which helps users scour the internet for their personal information. Before today, this tool could already locate data points like your name, phone number, email addresses, and home addresses. Following the update, you can now find and request the deletion of search results containing highly sensitive information, including your driver's license, passport, or Social Security number.To launch this tool, click here. If you've never used \"Results about you\" before, you'll need to set it up to tell Google what to look out for. Once you do, you'll be able to add government ID numbers, such as your driver's license, passport, and Social Security number. If Google finds a match, the company will let you know. You can receive an alert from the Google app on your smartphone, which takes you to a summary of what data was found and where. From here, you can choose from \"Request to remove,\" or \"Mark as reviewed.\"  \nUnfortunately, this tool won't remove the data from the websites that are hosting it, but it will eventually remove the search results—sharply reducing the chance that someone will find your data on their own. Google says these changes will roll out in the U.S. over the \"coming days,\" while it is working on bringing them to other countries in the future.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's simpler way to remove explicit images from Search\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nIn addition to these changes, Google is now rolling out a simpler tool for users to request the remove of non-consensual explicit images (NCEI) from Search. If you find such an image on Search, you can tap the three dots on that image, choose \"remove result,\" then \"it shows a sexual image of me.\" You'll have the choice to report whether the photo is real, or is artificially generated, as well, and you can report multiple images at once, if needed. Your requests will all appear in the Results about you hub, so you can track the progress of each.The tool lets you opt-in to an option that will filter additional explicit results in other searches. Google says it will also share links to \"emotional and legal support\" after you submit a request.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

I've written before about add-ons that manage to slip through official store safeguards and even some that \"wake up\" as malware after operating normally for several years, so it should come as no surprise that a host of AI-powered browser extensions—collectively  installed by tens of millions of users—may also be invading your privacy. Researchers at data removal service Incogni looked at browser extensions available in the Chrome Web Store that included \"AI\" in their name or description and employed AI as part of their core functionality. By analyzing the data collected and permissions required, they assessed both how likely extensions are to be used maliciously and their potential to cause significant damage if compromised.AI-powered browser extensions collect extensive user dataIncogni found that website content, such as text, images, sounds, videos, and hyperlinks, was the most commonly collected data type (by nearly a third of AI-powered extensions). More than 29% of extensions investigated harvest personally identifiable information (PII)—name, address, email, age, identification number, for example—from users. Other forms of data collected include user activity, authentication information, personal communication, location, financial and payment information, web history, and health information. \nThe most invasive extensions fall in the programming and mathematical aid category (such as Classology AI and StudyX), followed closely by meeting assistants and audio transcribers. Writing and personal assistants also pose privacy risks—and many of these are also among the most downloaded AI-powered extensions in Chrome. How popular AI-powered Chrome extensions stack up on privacyIncogni also assigned \"privacy-invasiveness\" scores to the most downloaded AI-powered extensions, a combination of the amount of data collected and both general and sensitive permissions required: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGrammarly: AI Writing Assistant and Grammar Checker App (tied for #1)Quillbot: AI Writing and Grammar Checker Tool (tied for #1)Sider: Chat wiht all AI (tied for #3)AI Grammar Checker & Paraphraser — LanguageTool (tied for #3)Google Translate (tied for #4)WPS PDF — Read, Edit, Fill, Convert, and AI Chat PDF with Ease (tied for #4)Monica: All-in-One AI Assist  (tied for #4)AI Chat for Google (tied for #4)Immersive Translate — Translate Web & PDFChatGPT searchGrammarly and Quillbot were found to collect PII and website content as well as location data like region, IP address, and GPS coordinates. Grammarly also harvest user activity through network monitoring, clicks, mouse and scroll positions, and keystroke logging. While both also require sensitive permissions—such as the ability to inject code into websites and access active browser tabs—they have a relatively low risk of being used maliciously. How to protect your personal informationBrowser extensions that use AI aren't inherently bad, but you should be aware of what information they are collecting and what permissions they are requiring. The most common type of sensitive permissions required are scripting, which allows the extension to interact with pages as you navigate online, as well as activeTab, which lets it read or modify the page for the current session. When adding an extension (or installing an app or program), carefully review the permissions requested. If they aren't essential to the extension's functionality–or if they are but don't seem justified—you may be putting your data or device at risk by allowing them. As Incogni points out, users have to decide how much privacy to sacrifice in order to use apps and services. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Your iPhone will detect and hide spam messages, and with the Screen Unknown Senders feature, you can filter out texts from anyone you don't know. You can also disable push notifications for these conversations to reduce how often you're alerted for messages you don't need to see. Note that this feature works only on iOS, so if you have Messages synced on your Mac, you'll see everything and receive notifications for all messages unless you mute specific conversations. How to reduce clutter in Messages on iOSTo send messages from numbers you don't know to a separate folder, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and toggle on Screen Unknown Senders. You can also get here through the Messages app on your iPhone by tapping the three horizontal menu lines in the top-right corner and selecting Manage Filtering. Enabling Screen Unknown Senders will hide notifications and move messages to your Unknown Senders list. If you want to allow (or disallow) certain types of notifications, tap Allow Notifications and toggle categories on or off: \nTime Sensitive includes alerts, verification codes, and urgent requests. Personal includes messages identified as not sent by a business or organization. Transactions include order updates, receipts, and confirmations. Promotions include general offers and updates sent to multiple recipients. Most users will want to enable time-sensitive notifications to receive messages that include time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) and other urgent alerts. You may also want to allow personal notifications so you don't miss messages directed to you individually from real people who aren't saved in your contacts.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen you allow notifications, texts identified in those categories will appear in your Messages list for only 12 hours before being moved to Unknown Senders—a behavior that keeps your primary inbox streamlined. If you want to make an unknown sender a known sender to prevent future messages from being filtered out, open the conversation and tap Mark as Known at the bottom or add the number to your contacts. A known sender is anyone you've added to your Contacts, sent a message to, or marked as known in the conversation. Finally, if you enable Filter Spam under the same menu in your device settings, Apple will send messages identified as spam to a separate Spam list and hide notifications. You can view these and conversations from unknown senders at any time via Messages > Menu. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But like any digital service, the data you provide when signing up is at the mercy of Substack, or anyone who happens to gain access to that data. Unfortunately, that's now the case. As reported by BleepingComputer, Substack recently disclosed a significant data breach. The company's CEO, Chris Best, sent users a notice of the breach this week, sharing that email addresses, phone numbers, and \"other internal metadata\" were shared from Substack accounts without their permission. The company reportedly discovered the breach on Feb. 3, even though hackers accessed the data itself in October of 2025. That means the data was in unauthorized hands for roughly four months before Substack identified the breach. Best explained that Substack has since fixed the problem with the system that allowed an unauthorized third party to access this data. The company is launching an investigation and is reportedly taking steps to prevent this type of breach from happening going forward. On the bright side, Best claims that credit card numbers, passwords, and financial information were not accessed in the breach. \nWhat Best doesn't share is the scope of the breach. For that, we have to turn to BleepingComputer, which found a post from a \"threat actor\" on the hacking forum BreachForums. The actor posted a database of 697,313 Substack records, sharing that the Substack user base is much larger, but the scraping method was \"noisy and patched fast.\" This actor says the data compromised includes email addresses, phone numbers, names, user IDs, Stripe IDs, profile pictures, and bios—a bit more detailed than the report from Substack's CEO.700,000 records isn't the same as 700,000 users: Each record is something like an email address or a phone number, which means one Substack user could have lost multiple records in the breach. Still, it's a large number of data points, and is little consolation to the users who have lost information here. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat Substack can do after this breachUnfortunately, there's not much users can do to mitigate a data breach once it's happened. The data stolen from Substack is already lost, and you won't be able to undo that. However, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself in the wake of the breach, and to prevent this data loss in the future. First, closely monitor your incoming texts and emails. Hackers will take advantage of the data here to target Substack users in phishing schemes. If you receive messages from strangers, or even suspicious messages claiming to come from Substack, exercise caution. As per usual, never click on links in messages from senders you don't know, and, even more importantly, never download files or applications if instructed. You may also want to consider masking your email address going forward. Use a service like Apple's \"Hide My Email\" or DuckDuckGo's email protection to generate a \"burner\" address each time you need to share your email with a service. The service will send messages to the burner address, which gets forwarded to your real address. That way, the service doesn't know your real address, and, if hacked, won't compromise it. Hackers will only get the burner, which you can shut down at any time.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men. Carefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight. Men can have eating disorders, tooBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness. Unfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"Unsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent. We all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.What’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.Unattainable beauty standards stay unattainableBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation.  “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty  regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor. What does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.As a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.The bottom lineThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement? Women have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.\n            \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

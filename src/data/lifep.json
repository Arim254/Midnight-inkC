Sure, third-party apps have filled this gap for many years now, but macOS itself didn't allow you to easily view multiple items stored in the clipboard, until now. With macOS 26 Tahoe, your Mac's Spotlight search has added support for clipboard history, which means that you can view pretty much everything you've copied in the past 30 days. Here's how to set up and use clipboard history on your Mac.How to enable clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nClipboard history is disabled by default on macOS Tahoe, so you'll have to activate it first. To do this, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's display and select System Settings. Now, go to Spotlight and scroll to the bottom in the right pane. Enable Results from Clipboard, and then click the drop-down menu below it. This lets you choose how long you want to store your clipboard history for. Apple gives you three choices: 8 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. Once you've made your choice, you'll be ready to use clipboard history on your Mac.If you copy sensitive items to the clipboard very often, you should probably avoid enabling this feature. I know many people who somehow still store passwords, credit card information, and other banking details in WhatsApp chats or plain text files. The moment you copy sensitive data from unsecured locations, it gets added to your clipboard history, which is not ideal. The good news is that if you copy passwords from Apple Passwords or other password management apps, they don't appear in your Mac's clipboard history.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccessing and using clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can access your Mac's clipboard history by using macOS Tahoe's Spotlight Search. First, copy a few items to your clipboard. These can be text, photos, or other files. Use the Command-Space keyboard shortcut (or click the magnifying glass in your Mac's top-right corner) to open Spotlight, and press Command-4. This will open your Mac's clipboard history, where you'll be able to see all the files you've copied recently.To see older items, scroll down. Next to each item, you'll see a small copy button, which you can use to copy that item to your clipboard once again. This is useful if you've copied multiple items in a row, but forgot to paste the first few. You can also select any item in your clipboard history list and press the return key on your keyboard to paste that item in the app that's in the foreground. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you want to quickly clear your clipboard history, fire up Spotlight (Command-Space), followed by the clipboard history page (Command-4), and select the three-dots button on the right. Select Clear History here to erase your entire clipboard. Or you can simply wait—Apple will automatically erase everything in your clipboard after your preset time limit (between 8 hours and 30 days, depending on what you chose in System Settings).Third-party clipboard management apps are better\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm aware that some people don't use Spotlight at all, in favor of better alternatives like Raycast or Alfred. Luckily, those apps come with built-in clipboard managers, too. Spotlight's implementation is good enough for basic use cases, but it needs a quicker way to access and paste from your clipboard history. While clipboard history in Spotlight is a nice upgrade, I still feel that if you're serious about clipboard management, third-party alternatives are the way to go. The best clipboard managers for Mac will allow you to sync your clipboard history across multiple devices, let you exclude certain apps from your clipboard history, filter clipboard items by type (links, text, images, etc.), copy multiple items and paste them sequentially (useful for filling repetitive forms), extract and copy text from images, and so much more. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Google wants you to trust AI to click the buy button for you. Rolling out today, Google's new \"agentic checkout\" adds onto the company's existing price-tracking feature, so it's not something you'll see all the time. Instead, when you get a price drop notification on an object you've been tracking, you might now see a new \"buy for me\" button that will send all the necessary information to the store's website and make the final purchase for you.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says the AI will always ask your permission before starting agentic checkout, and will only go through with the purchase after you've confirmed all your shipping and payment details (which it will either pull from your Google Pay details, or directly ask you for). The price you'll see also isn't informed by AI, but rather by Google's Shopping Graph, the same information that powers Google Search's Shopping tab. That means it'll come directly from the store you'll be buying from, although while Google does promise it'll surface the most relevant offers for you, just trusting whatever the notification says will take away your ability to manually comparison shop. Once the AI has made your purchase for you, you should see all the usual confirmation emails hit whatever inbox you told the AI to link with your purchase. It all makes sense in theory—you're essentially being given a link to a product, and then telling the AI to go to that link and fill out the checkout form for you. That should cut down on hallucination concerns, assuming you're happy with the link you're buying from. The catch is that every website's checkout form is a little different, so Google's starting with just a few stores for now, to cut down on the chance for errors. That means you'll only be able to try agentic checkout when buying from Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and \"select Shopify merchants\" for now, but Google says there will be \"many more [stores] coming soon.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhile agentic checkout does take what can be a lengthy process down to a single click for buyers, the real use case here might be for sellers. Ensuring people actually click through to your store from a price drop notification can be a pain, and letting customers buy straight from the notification with a single button could make impulse purchases a bit more likely. If you notice yourself about to buy something just because a shiny new button is there, maybe take a beat before tapping it and consider whether you still want it or if you want to check other options yourself first.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nIf you want to try out agentic checkout for yourself, you'll first need to start tracking a product's price, and ensure it's something Wayfair, Chewy, or another participating retailer would sell. To do this, head to the Google Shopping tab, search for either a specific product or a broader product category, and scroll until you find a product card you want to track. Click through and hit the \"Track price button.\" Here, choose a target price as well as options like size or color, and click \"Update\" in the bottom right corner. You'll now get a notification when a listing matches the parameters you set, and if the link Google found is from a participating store, you'll be able to use the \"Buy for me\" button. Click or tap it to ensure your details are correct, then tap \"Buy for me with GPay\" at the bottom of the screen. You'll get a progress bar showing when your purchase has been submitted and confirmed, and the page will tell you where to expect your confirmation email. You'll also get a Buy for me reference ID you can take to Google support, in case you run into any issues.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nUnfortunately, it seems like there's still a few features Google needs to work on here before the AI can do everything a human can. A Google spokesperson told me that agentic checkout currently can't take factors like loyalty programs into account, so if you want to buy the product from a specific store account to get credit for it, you'll still need to make your purchase manually.If you're buying a lot, it could be a time saver, but as for now, those caveats and the limited selection of stores means you'll probably still have to complete checkout yourself on most purchases right now.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I love structured to-do lists and days where everything comes together, but in a world where work, school, personal wellness, family, and friends are putting endless demands on us, it's not always possible to get it all done in one morning—even with the most detailed, time-boxed schedule. If you feel some burnout coming on or want to switch up your routine before you do, consider the concept of \"slow productivity,\" guidance from productivity guru Cal Newport. What is slow productivity?Well, first of all, it's the title of Newport's latest book: Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout. He's the guy who gave us the idea of \"deep work,\" or getting into a position to focus completely on a single task without distraction. With this \"slow productivity\" framework, he advocates for people to do fewer things, work at a natural pace, and \"obsess\" over the quality of their work. That stands in contrast to how a normal day goes for most of us, trying to do a bunch of different stuff at warp speed, banging out a high quantity of finished tasks with varying levels of quality. Newport's premise is that work used to be more hands-on, but as manufacturing has given way to \"knowledge work,\" we've started to confuse being busy with being productive. The typical worker now spends days sorting through emails and Slack messages, not necessarily creating anything or ending a shift with something to show for their labor. Spending all day on Zoom and Slack doesn't leave much time for actually working, thinking, writing, or doing much else in the way of deep work. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHe's not the first big brain to theorize about how much the quality of work starts to dip if you take on too much, though. Illich's Law, for example, says that the longer you work, the worse your work gets. Even the productivity technique that's arguably the most famous, the Pomodoro method, is structured around the idea that you shouldn't work too hard for too long without a short break. But slow productivity is a little different and adds some necessary context and thought to what we already know to be true, which is that you can't do it all at once and you shouldn't bother trying.How to use slow productivity during the work dayTo harness slow productivity, you have to rely on those three pillars of doing fewer things, working at a natural pace, and obsessing over quality. Here, start slowly. Building structured schedules and data-driven, prioritized to-do lists is important, so I'm not going to suggest that you should give it up altogether, but what if your schedule made time for a single-task day once a week to start?Look at your to-do list, whatever method you use to structure it. Identify a major task that needs to be completed. One day a week, at least in the beginning, block out your schedule so you're only working on that task. To the best of your ability, don't schedule any meetings (or choose a day where you have none), don't be super available by Slack or email, and fall back on the principles of deep work and productivity. That means take periodic breaks, work with no distractions, and work toward a larger goal—which, in this case, is producing a quality product that furthers your mission, whether it's a personal mission like getting a raise or a company-wide one like increasing sales. Keep notes on how much you got done.For me, it's helpful to keep my longer-term goals top of mind while I toil on the daily stuff. You can use a SMART goal or one of its alternatives to do this, writing out your goals in a detailed, forward-thinking, and action-oriented way. If you're going to dedicate an entire day to one project, you need the motivational push that comes with remembering why you're working on that project at all. Eventually, you might get good at siloing tasks on a single day. In fact, doing that every day is its own productivity hack—but let's stick to a slow start on slow productivity for now.At the end of each one of your single-task days, conduct a little after-action review to determine what went well and what needs adjusting. After trying this approach for a few weeks, assess your output. By putting your focus on one task, not rushing, and giving some meaningful attention and care to the quality of what you're doing, you should end up with better work that is actually more productive overall than a bunch of fast, smaller tasks. You can use this framework in other areas of your life, too. When you get home on Tuesdays, for instance, that can be your night to focus only on meal planning for the next week or handling your kids' affairs and schedules. Maybe Wednesdays can be solely devoted to cleaning the house or to seeing and catching up with friends. There's still some scheduling involved, but you're avoiding the buildup of minor tasks and stress, which will help stave off burnout and make the things you do focus on in those time blocks more productive and meaningful. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I'm asking the tough questions about whether wearables can really improve your health, how to find the right one for you, and how to make the most of the data wearables can offer.When I test smartwatches and fitness trackers, I always pay attention to accuracy. Is my running pace correct? Does the device capture the ups and downs of my heart rate? I even got a VO2max lab test to check a bunch of watches' fitness scores. But you'll notice that one thing I don't test for accuracy is calorie burn. None of my devices come close to agreeing on the number of calories they think I'm burning, and I don't expect them to. Even scientists who study the accuracy of wearables can't answer the question in a way that's useful when you're shopping for this year's devices—but we'll get into why that is below. There was a time, before Fitbits, when nobody knew quite how many calories they were burning on a daily basis. Sure, you could calculate a rough estimate based on your body size, sex, and age. You could choose whether or not to believe the calorie readout on the cardio machines at the gym. (Spoiler: don't.) But the idea that a gadget on your wrist could tell you how many calories you personally burned during one particular day was revolutionary. It was also wrong.   \nHow fitness trackers calculate calorie burnBefore I discuss how accurate fitness trackers are, let’s look at where they get their numbers. For calorie calculations, the main sources are motion and heart rate data. For motion, trackers use accelerometers to figure out when your body is moving, and by how much. If you have a watch on your wrist, and the watch swings back and forth rhythmically while sort of bouncing up and down, your gadget guesses that you must be walking. If there is quicker bouncing and your wrist makes a smaller movement, you’re probably running. This is the basic idea behind how trackers detect how many steps you’re taking. If you’ve paid attention to your step count, you already know some of the ways this can be inaccurate. If you’re shopping, for example, keeping your hand on the shopping cart handle may result in you not getting credit for the steps you’re taking. That depends on the device, though. (For a perfect illustration of this issue, see these tests I did comparing a Garmin to an Apple Watch on a treadmill. When I rested my hands on the treadmill handle, the Apple Watch recorded 318 steps while the Garmin recorded none.)Then there’s the heart rate sensor: Since your hands don’t always move predictably during exercise, it can be easier to just tell your watch that you’ll be cycling or doing yoga or whatever. The gadget then uses your heart rate to make an educated guess about how much work your body is doing. Whatever the source of the data—heart rate, movements, or a combination—the gadget processes it through a formula to calculate how many calories it thinks you’re burning. Your age, weight, and sex may figure into this equation. Generally, though, the fitness tracker doesn’t actually know how many calories you’re burning; instead, it’s calculating a probable number based on incomplete information. Why there's no simple test for accuracyIf humans were robots, all built the same, all moving in predictable patterns, this formulaic approach might work. But humans are complicated, and technology often gets confused. For example, you may get different step counts if you put a device on your right versus left wrist. And the optical heart rate sensors that a lot of trackers use may be less accurate on dark skin compared to lighter skin. These problems relate to the data that the trackers gather, but calorie burn isn't a direct measurement. It's a calculation, and different algorithms can come up with different calorie burn numbers depending on how the algorithm is designed. The companies that make fitness trackers aren’t required to publish their algorithms or verify that their calorie counts are accurate. They can just put a device on the market, and there you are, comparing wearables on shopping sites without any information about how accurate they are, outside of the companies’ claims.Researchers are interested in fitness trackers’ accuracy, which would seem like a good thing. They want to be able to use wearables in research or recommend them for individuals and healthcare providers, and so they'll run studies comparing consumer devices to lab equipment. This sounds like a great way to answer our questions! But there’s a huge delay in actually getting that information, and it’s often published too late to be useful. By the time a researcher buys a batch of the latest model, runs a study, writes it up, submits it to a journal, and finally gets it published, several years may have gone by, and the company has moved on to the next model. That delay is why I (usually) can't use scientific studies to weigh in on the devices I write about. Here's a great example of how frustrating it can be: this review was published in 2025, and found the Series 1 was the Apple Watch that turned up the most often in the studies the authors were able to gather. The Series 9 and 10 watches were completely missing from the available data, and as a reminder, we're now up to a Series 11. With that caveat about delays, I still think it’s useful to look at the research on fitness trackers to see what themes emerge. Are any of them good at estimating your calorie burn? What studies say about fitness trackers’ accuracyTime for the bad news. A study from 2020 that looked at a variety of gadgets from Apple, Garmin, Polar, and Fitbit found that all the devices are inaccurate more often than they are accurate. The authors considered a device to be accurate if its reading was plus or minus 3% when compared to a more reliable measure of energy expenditure (that is, calorie burn) in a lab setting. Here’s how some of the top brands fared: Garmins underestimated calorie burn 69% of the time.Apple watches overestimated calorie burn 58% of the time.Polar devices overestimated calorie burn 69% of the time.Fitbits underestimated calorie burn 48% of the time and overestimated 39% of the time.The fact that Fitbits were roughly correct on average doesn’t mean they were useful. If sometimes your device overestimates and sometimes it underestimates, it’s not very helpful unless you know which is which. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA 2018 review specifically of Fitbits found that accuracy varied greatly depending on factors like where they were worn (torso was more accurate than wrist), whether you were walking uphill, and whether you walked at a constant speed or stopped and started. The accuracy also varied by device, with the Fitbit Classic underestimating calorie burn and the Fitbit Charge usually overestimating. The devices just aren’t accurate enough to know how many calories you’re really burningA 2022 study compared the Apple Watch 6, the Fitbit Sense, and the Polar Vantage V. The researchers had volunteers wear all three gadgets while sitting quietly, walking, running, cycling, and strength training. Every gadget, for every activity, was awarded a judgment of “poor accuracy,” with coefficients of variation ranging from 15% to 30%.And this 2025 review of Apple Watch studies—the same one I mentioned above—found that calorie burn was, on average, off by about 18%. The authors mention a proposed standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission that recommends fitness trackers not be off by more than 10%. That's clearly not being met, although the researchers noted that newer models may be more accurate than earlier ones. To get a sense of these percentages, let's say your true calorie burn is 2,000 calories per day. A device that's off by 15% might report that you burned 1,700 calories, or that you burned 2,300. If you're using your device to figure out how much to eat, you could be way off in meeting your calorie goals. If these devices are all inaccurate, how can you know how many calories you're burning?It’s probably most useful if you think of your calorie burn as a number you cannot measure directly. Treat it as a black box: I burn some unknowable number of calories, now what? The only common reason you would need an accurate estimate of calorie burn is if you are trying to figure out how much food you need to eat. If you want to lose weight, you want to eat less than you burn; if you want to gain weight, you want the reverse; and if you’re trying to maintain your weight, you want to eat roughly the same as what you burn. But think about it this way: you don't actually need to know your calorie burn if you have the other two terms in the equation—your calorie intake, and your weight. It's considered more accurate to adjust how much to eat based directly on your weight, rather than using calorie burn estimates as a middleman. Let’s say you’re training for a marathon and you want to make sure you fuel yourself appropriately. Well, if you’re under-eating, you’ll start to lose weight. When you start to see the scale trending downward, that’s your signal to add a few hundred calories to your diet. If, after that adjustment, your weight stays steady, then you know you’re eating the right amount. As you increase your training (or if you take time off to rest a sprained ankle), you can make more adjustments as you go. I have a post here detailing how to make these adjustments with the help of either a paid app, a group of free apps, or a DIY spreadsheet. If you’ve been using a fitness tracker instead, and it’s working for you, feel free to keep using it. But if the tracker ever stops giving you the results you want, you can safely leave it out of the equation. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

All that surrounding noise can make it difficult to stick to the task at hand, and actually get some solid work done.I enjoy browsing social media and exploring the web as much as the next person, but I've also got plenty of writing to get through every day, and distractions can seriously slow me down. Studies have shown that we do much better when we focus on one task at a time, which for me is writing guides and articles.While distraction-free devices such as the Freewrite Smart Typewriter have always appealed, I wanted to be more focused while using my MacBook Air. To that end, I've come up with a strategy for minimizing distractions as much as possible, and it's something you might find helpful for your own work.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThese steps apply specifically to macOS and Google Docs, which is what I use for most of my writing, but you can adapt them for Windows and other word processors too.Turn off notifications\n    \n            \n            Focus modes are an easy way to manage notifications.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNotifications is a good place to start—if your laptop is continually pinging and alerting you to other things, it's hard to get anything done. On macOS, notification settings can be handled by clicking the Apple icon (top left), then System Settings > Notifications. Here you can set alerts on an app-by-app basis.For me, the Focus entry in System Settings is even more useful. Here I've set up a dedicated Work focus mode that blocks all notifications from all apps, and leaves me in peace. To create your own mode, click Add Focus on the main list—you can either set them to run on a schedule, or enable them manually via Focus in the Control Center (click the toggle switches on the menu bar, top right, to access them).For the best results, you need to silence your phone as well, which is likely to be interrupting you even more than your laptop. If you're using an iPhone, you can sync Focus modes across both macOS and iOS, by enabling the Share across devices toggle switch on the main Focus options screen.Tweak your writing software\n    \n            \n            Google Docs has a few tricks for distraction-free writing.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEven without notifications enabled, it's easy to catch sight of something else you could be doing on your laptop, rather than concentrating on a single task. Explore the various options available within your word processor of choice to make the interface as minimal as possible—which in my case involves tweaking the look of Google Docs.To get the same effect on your own Google Docs documents, first head to the View menu and make sure the ruler, equation toolbar, and spelling and grammar suggestions are all hidden (for me, they just add to the on-screen clutter). Then, open the Format menu and choose Switch to pageless format to get one long, flowing page.Next, select View and pick Full screen, and then maximize the browser window in macOS using the green button up in the top left corner. Hey presto—all you've got on screen now are your words, with nothing else to distract you. To bring back the Google Docs menus and toolbars, press Esc to exit maximized mode, move the cursor to the top of the screen and click the green button again.Turn off the internet\n    \n            \n            Turn off wifi to reduce distractions further.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFor the most extreme version of a distraction-free writing device—heading back to the days of the typewriter—I block internet access on my laptop too (on macOS, you can just click the wifi symbol on the menu bar, top right, then toggle off Wi-Fi). Sure, it's not the most comprehensive way of blocking the internet, but it works for me, and makes me think twice about going online (yes, Google Docs can work offline).I find it makes me less likely to check the news, social media, or email when I should be writing. The obvious problem is that I can't look up anything online either, so it's a bit of a soft rule I have—I try to at least write certain chunks of articles while offline, then do all my online research at once, and without opening dozens of browser tabs.You can tailor this to suit yourself, but I've found switching off the internet makes me more likely to rely on my own thoughts and word choices—without recourse to a dictionary or thesaurus.

Because so many of the new model's biggest features are hidden behind paywalls, it's not a bad deal, even if it's not the first time Google's done this. The deal follows similar promotions from April and August, although the most recent one ended in October. That this offer is coming so soon after the last one means Google might plan to keep rolling out these trials on a regular basis.How to claim your free year of Google AI Pro as a U.S. college studentTo get your free year of Google AI Pro, first head over to gemini.google/students and click Get Offer. You'll then need to log into your personal Google account, where you'll be prompted to verify your student status using SheerID. After that, Google says it should be a pretty straightforward signup flow, although being over a decade out of college by now, I'm not able to test it personally.Note that you will need to provide a form of payment, and that if you don't cancel the plan by the time the trail is over, your subscription will renew using your provided payment method. You also only have until January 31, 2026 to sign up for the trail.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe most likely error you're likely to run into is if your college isn't supported by the trial, which is handled by SheerID. Neither Google nor SheerID are being upfront about which institutions are and aren't supported, but Google says that if you run into issues, you can contact [email protected] or go to the SheerID help center.You also have to be older than 18, which means some freshman might have trouble signing up, and you cannot be on a supervised Google Account, or currently have a Google One subscription through either family sharing or a third party affiliate. Google says you can cancel an existing paid AI Pro plan to swap it for the trial, but you can't try to subscribe using the trial while applying a discount from buying a Pixel phone (which would theoretically apply after the free period ends).There's also some conflicting communication online. The current offer terms state you must \"be a resident of the United States,\" although the current help page for the trial still refers to previous offers, which were offered to other regions as well. I've reached out to Google for clarification, but for now, I would assume the offer only applies to those in the U.S. and expires on January 31, given the information in the Gemini 3 Pro press release.I've also reached out to Google about whether students who've already claimed the free year-long trial can extend their offer time by signing up for the new one, as while the help page mentions that \"new and existing Google one members,\" are eligible, it's unclear whether those already on a free trial count as proper subscribers. I'd guess the answer is probably no, but I'll let you know if Google tells me otherwise.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat you get with your free year of Google AI ProYour free year of Google AI Pro comes with a free year of Google One Premium, too, which means it's got some benefits for you even if you're skeptical about AI.For AI users, Google AI Pro offers the following:Higher usage limits for deep research and recent models like Gemini 3 ProGemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3 Pro in AI ModeVideo generation with Veo 3.1 Fast and higher access to Google Flow and image-to-video generation in Veo 3.More remix generations and Veo 3 photo-to-video generations in Google photos1,000 monthly AI creditsIncreased NotebookLM accessHigher limits in coding tools including Jules, Gemini Code Assist, Gemini CLIGoogle Home Premium with Gemini features and 30 days of event historyFor everyone else, you'll still get 2TB of free cloud storage through Google One, which should be handy for all those assignments. Normally, when signing up for a Google One Premium Plan, you also have the option to bundle a YouTube Premium individual plan for a 14% discount, although it's unclear to me whether that's included in the trial, so I've also reached out to Google for clarity on this.And that's it! Personally, I wouldn't see myself using most of those AI features, but the 2TB of cloud storage is good enough that it's probably worth signing up for the trial just for that. Just remember to either be ready to pay the $20/month price once your year is up, or cancel before then.

You can (and should) prioritize your to-dos by timeliness and time box your way to a jam-packed, detailed schedule, but there’s more to time management than that. You should also consider dividing up not only your day, but your week overall, to maximize productivity. The trick here is to theme your workdays. Instead of jumping from task to task on any given day, try grouping all the similar ones together and parking them on a specific day, when your schedule allows. By putting similar tasks together on the same day, you’ll stay in that “zone” longer, focusing only on what needs to be done in it. If all the things you have to do have something in common, you’ll stay focused on the central theme of the day’s work as you move from task to task.How to divvy up themed days for productivityFirst, start by thinking about why you want to do what you're doing. I don't mean you need to get all philosophical, but adding a \"why\" to your to-do list is valuable. You don't just want to clean your house because you have to, but because you want a safe, comfortable space or because your mom is coming to say for a week and you want her to feel cozy (and not harp on you about any lingering dust). You don't just want to finish your big project at work because it was assigned to you, but because you want to grow in your career, stay employed, or get a promotion. If thinking this way is a stretch for you, try setting SMART goals around your tasks. SMART goals are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (in accordance with the acronym) and they help you stay focused on why you're doing what you're doing, as well as how you're going to do it.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSet these intentions so you feel like you have something to work toward. That's where the daily themes come in. If you complete similar tasks over the course of one day, you are striving for an intention—meeting whatever goal you’ve set for that day’s theme—and staying focused on it from task to task.Say you have a big project at work. Here's how your first three days could look: Consider getting all administrative-type work done on Mondays. Designate Mondays for responding to emails, sending out new ones, taking calls, or scheduling meetings. Make sure you use this day to request any resources, details, or answers you need from others involved in the project, so you have everything you need for the following days. Creative activities, like brainstorming or designing, could be handled Tuesday, while Wednesday could be for research.You could also theme your days by project, according to Leonard Alexandru, an engineering director at Deloitte who has written about the value of themed days. Instead of dedicating time every day to multiple projects, consider assigning each project its own specific day of the week for work, so a project that requires a big focus on management should take up a whole day while one that requires you to focus on marketing, communications, sales, or whatever else should be on another.Why this works (and what to keep in mind)I do this around my apartment: One day is for cleaning my bedroom, the other is for the living room, and another is for the kitchen. It is that simple—and broadly applicable beyond your job. Hell, if you do strength training, you probably already do arm day, back day, leg day, etc. You wouldn't do a lat pulldown on leg day because it wouldn't make sense to exhaust your whole body, nor divert your focus from your glutes and quads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reason it works is the same reason divvying up gym days works. When you are focused entirely on one thing, you do better at it, which makes you more productive at it. When you throw everything into the metaphorical blender, you lose that focus. Plus, the stress of figuring out what to do at a given time is gone, leaving you open to just get to work. You can \"eat the frog\" (that is, tackle your biggest task first) or work off a system like 1-3-5, which calls on you to take care of one major task, three medium-sized ones, and five smaller ones. With a themed grouping, you don't have to decide what those are; you just go.Try setting each day’s theme as an all-day event on whatever calendar software you use, so you’ll have a reminder at the top of the page about what to focus on each day. Just knowing your Thursdays are for client meetings, for instance, relieves you of the anxiety of deciding what to prioritize that day or when to schedule those meetings. It eliminates decision fatigue and keeps you on-task without you having to think too hard about what activity should go in what slot during your busy week. Obviously, a necessary or urgent meeting could crop up on a day that isn't Thursday. It's fine to take it, of course, but try to keep the general framework of the themed days whenever you can. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The new feature is powered by Google's \"Shopping Graph,\" a list of 50 billion products that also informs Google's Shopping tab, and it's available to everyone on both desktop and mobile starting today.Here's how it works: In Google search's AI Mode or the Gemini app/website, you can ask a question or send a prompt about a physical product, like \"Help me find an espresso maker that has a steam wand, is affordable, and is good for beginners.\" If the AI can find relevant product information in the Shopping Graph, it'll then give you a short writeup and pop up a few product suggestions along with shopping information, like pricing and user reviews. Clicking on any of these tiles will then open a sidebar with sites where you can purchase the item.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nEssentially, it's like using Google's Shopping tab, but with a virtual shopping assistant (or, let's be real, a salesperson) you can turn to for more context about what you're seeing. Some queries will even let you click a checkbox on their product tiles so you can mark off to ask follow-up questions. For instance, you could check off two product tiles and ask the AI to compare them, or ask which is cheaper or has better reviews.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccording to Google representatives at a press event, the company is hoping this will make it easier for shoppers to buy gifts for friends or relatives that are traditionally hard to shop for, and that it will make shopping easier by letting people search using natural language.My hands-on experienceWhen I tested out this new tool, it generally worked out, but I did encounter a few hiccups. The biggest was that it was hard to get the AI to recognize certain products as topics it could surface tiles for. For instance, asking for \"Popular Nintendo Switch games under $60\" just gave me a list of games, but no links to purchase them. I assume this is because the AI thought I was simply asking for general advice about what to play instead of shopping, but no amount of rewording would prompt the tool to show me product tiles, even when I explicitly asked for them.I also ran into problems when it came to natural language searches. At the aforementioned press event, Google gave journalists example questions to ask the AI in order to try the new feature, but I found only the questions that called out specific types of products would give me tiles to click on. For instance, a question like \"Give me Christmas gift ideas for my sister who loves knitting and reading\" wouldn't trigger the new feature, but \"show me ottomans that can be used as coffee tables\" would. Even the example Google used in its blog announcing the feature wouldn't work for me—asking for Christmas gift ideas for a college student who likes to run gave me generic answers like \"running shoes\" and \"moisture-wicking socks,\" but didn't show any specific examples that I could buy.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat shouldn't stop you from getting gift ideas from the AI, but it does mean that when you're ready to buy, you'll want to ask a fresh question that asks for a specific type of product, rather than ideas for a specific person. It's a bit of an extra step for something that's supposed to take the guesswork out of the buying process.With those caveats in place, I still see most users still sticking to the regular shopping tab, where they can be sure they'll get product links every time. But Google's hoping that integrating shopping into AI Mode will eventually give users the best of both worlds, allowing them to make more specific searches than they could without AI, and also allowing the AI to call on training data the shopping tab doesn't have access to, like Reddit posts and website reviews.Now I just need to find a way to convince my family that all my thoughtful gift ideas didn't just come from a robot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

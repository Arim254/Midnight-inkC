You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts. If you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)To pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning. \nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app: Gesture navigation: Swipe up and hold2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + OverviewNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you let someone else use your device—whether you're showing a friend a collection of photos or allowing a stranger to make an emergency call—there's a lot you don't want them to be able to see. If you're an iPhone user, there are several features you can enable to prevent others from snooping around your device. Use Guided AccessIf you don't want someone using your device to see anything else on it, you can turn on Guided Access, which limits them to a single app (such as Phone or Photos). This essentially locks down your screen and prevents navigation outside of the specific features you make available. \nFirst, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle the feature on. Tap Passcode Settings to set up a specific passcode or flip the Face ID toggle to use biometrics to end Guided Access sessions. To start a Guided Access session before handing over your phone, open the app and triple click the side button. You can circle specific areas of the screen you don't want to respond to touch (such as swipes through Photos). Tap Session Settings at the bottom to set a time limit, disable the keyboard, and manage button press options. Then tap Start. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nTo end a Guided Access session, triple-click the side button and enter your passcode or double-click and authenticate with Face ID. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can also lock or hide specific appsSome mobile apps, like financial apps and password managers, already require you to log in or authenticate with your username and password combo or device biometrics every time you open them. You can also lock down other individual apps on iPhone so Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode is required for access. To lock an app from your home screen, touch and hold the icon until the quick actions menu appears, then tap Require Face ID. Alternatively, you can hide apps so others cannot see them on your device (let alone open them) unless you authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. To hide an app, tap and hold the icon on the home screen and tap Require Face ID in the quick actions menu. Tap Hide and Require Face ID > Hide App. If you need to open a hidden app, swipe left on your home screen to reach your App Library, locate the Hidden folder at the bottom, and tap and authenticate to unlock the folder followed by the app. (Note that some native iOS apps, including Calculator, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Find My, Maps, Shortcuts, and Settings, cannot be locked, and system apps that come preinstalled cannot be hidden.)\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.The free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.To get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.The third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.It's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can read more on the project's Github page.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that. WheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel. When I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment. \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Iyaz Akhtar\n                    \n    \nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This scheme, dubbed GhostPairing by researchers, uses WhatsApp's device linking process to allow fraudsters to access all of your messages, impersonate you in chats, and perpetuate the scam to your contacts. Here's how threat actors are hijacking WhatsApp accounts—and how to defend yours. GhostPairing manipulates WhatsApp device linkingWhatsApp allows users to link their desktop or browser to their account without needing to enter login credentials in one of two ways: scanning a QR code and approving the session or confirming a numeric pairing code in the mobile app. While the GhostPairing scam could theoretically manipulate users in either approach, researchers found that the latter is much more common. The fraud begins with a short message sent from a contact with a link that purportedly goes to a Facebook photo or some type of Facebook content. If you click through, you'll be directed to a spoofed Facebook login page to enter your phone number—a familiar confirmation flow for Meta platforms. The next screen will likely show a numeric code with instructions to enter said code into WhatsApp to confirm the login (again, this may feel like a familiar two-step verification). If you're not paying attention, you may not realize that this didn't do anything on your end but instead registered the attacker's browser as a linked device to your account. \n\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe danger in this scam is that everything will seem normal on your device and in your account, as attackers haven't hijacked your credentials to lock you out. However, they can do anything and everything in WhatsApp that you can, such as reading chats, receiving messages, viewing and downloading media, collecting information from your contacts, and forwarding the same phishing link. As they learn more about you and the people you know, they can potentially use that for ongoing scams. How to protect your WhatsApp accountAs always, be wary of links received via messaging platforms, even if they seem harmless or you think you know and can trust the sender. Threat actors frequently use social media and direct messaging to spread phishing lures. If you do click a link in WhatsApp (or any other communication), read all prompts carefully before providing or verifying any information to identify scams. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo protect your WhatsApp account specifically, you can set up two-step verification, which will also prevent attackers from adding or changing a connected email address. Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN and add an email address when prompted. You can also check to see if there are any suspicious devices paired with your account under Settings > Linked devices and remove any you don't recognize or regularly use.Finally, if you have been targeted by this scam, let your WhatsApp contacts know, as threat actors may spread the malicious link by making it look like it came from you. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

California residents have gained more control over their personal data than those in other states since the passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in 2018, and they now have a one-stop shop for requesting that their information be removed from hundreds of data brokers registered with the state (and any that do so in the future). California isn't the only state to enact stronger consumer privacy laws in recent years, but its Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) is the first of its kind. The tool is live now, though brokers won't begin processing submissions until August. Here's what to do now if you live in California—and some options for removing your information from data brokers if you don't. How to sign up for California's data removal platformTo get started with DROP, you'll need to confirm that you are, in fact, a California resident by verifying personal information via California Identity Gateway or signing in with Login.gov credentials. To be eligible, you must either live in California or be domiciled in the state even if you live elsewhere temporarily. (This is based on the location of your primary residence, where you are registered to vote, and which state issued your driver's license.)\nYou will then be able to create and submit a deletion request. You'll need to provide some personal data, which will be used to match your request with records held by data brokers. Data types include names, date of birth, zip codes, email addresses, phone numbers, Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs), and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). You can enter multiples of everything except your date of birth and update your request at a later time—if you get a new car or change your email, for example. While you can begin submitting requests now, know that data brokers won't actually begin processing them until August 2026 and could take up to 90 days from then to delete your data. If they find a match, they are required to delete all of the information they have about you, though there are some exceptions, such as data available through public records or provided directly to a business. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nOnce processing begins later this year, you'll be able to track the status of your request on the DROP platform. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAlternatives for deleting your dataIf you don't reside in California and qualify for DROP, all is not lost—though you will have to invest a bit more time and/or money to remove your information from data broker sites than simply mass deleting via a single request. To start opting out of data collection, download Consumer Reports' donation-based Permission Slip app, which tracks where your data can be found and follows up on removal requests. You can try to manually opt out by identifying data brokers and going directly to their sites, but this can be tedious, and there are a handful of other paid services that will do it for you. (None are perfect, nor do they guarantee 100% success.)

One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove. iGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.Why this is aging-in-place techA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on. \nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.The device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.Why radar is involvedA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.I’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00. Other monitoring and safety featuresBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running. The device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.While a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.Update 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove. \n            \n    ",

In general, I'm a deeply goal-oriented person and I am, for better or worse, obsessed with \"winning\"—which I always thought made me a perfect candidate for complicated productivity techniques like detailed to-do lists full of tasks in order of priority. While I do love a good technique, I decided to switch things up last year when I got worried that maybe I was spending so much time prioritizing and planning that I wasn't spending enough time doing. So I just focused on the doing—and it worked. Here's what I mean and how my bright idea helped me crush last year's resolutions. Adopting a \"do it now\" mindsetI've covered a lot of productivity hacks for Lifehacker and the two I liked best, both in theory and practice, were the two- and 10-minute rules. The idea is that if a particular tasks takes less than two (or 10, depending on your preferred approach) minutes to complete, you should just get it out of the way early in the day. It's smart because it leaves little time for deliberation or over-planning, but even when I used it for the 10-minute tasks, I wasn't convinced it was effective enough. Some tasks take longer than 10 minutes. I felt like the \"just do it\" mentality was helpful for me, but could be more helpful. So I started thinking more in terms of simply \"do it now,\" not in terms of time allotments. Sitting down every morning to write out a to-do list and determine how long each responsibility will take, which are most important, and which will demand the most resources works well for some people, but it is too tedious for me. Since coming around on a \"do it now\" mindset, I don't do that anymore at all. When I think of something, I just do it, no matter what it is or how long it will take (within reason). If, for some reason, I can't fit it in at the moment I come up with it, I add it to a note on my phone, which I also count as doing it now, though the \"it\" is adding the task to the list. \nHow this has helped meMy goals for the last year have largely been about my health and fitness, as well as my living space. I wanted to become a healthier, better me, which involved more time in the gym and having a clean, organized home to relax in. My \"do it now\" mindset helped me with both, especially when I was starting out on my resolutions around this time last year. I didn't pressure myself to work out at a certain time or try to wedge exercise into a structured daily schedule. Instead, I just firmly told myself I'd go when it occurred to me and I wouldn't deliberate or make any excuses. I found myself at the gym on lunch breaks, Saturday mornings, and late week nights. As soon as I thought of it, I went (or worked out at home, usually riding my Peloton)—and it worked. The longer I did this, the more working out became a normal, expected part of my day. Notably, by the fall, I had developed such an affinity for my hour of physical activity each day that I did start scheduling it and have been able to wake up every day before the sun to simply knock it out. I don't think that would have happened if I hadn't tried my new motivation-first approach.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThe same was true for cleaning. There are so many cleaning techniques and approaches out there and, to be clear, each one of those works well for a certain kind of person. I've tried them all and nothing was as useful to me as just cleaning something the moment I thought of it or saw it needed to be done. If I see a dirty baseboard, I don't file that information away for \"living room cleaning\" day; I hop off the couch and wipe it down. Building this habit was a challenge because it's easy to kick the can down the road and decide to complete these tasks during designated home-tidying times, but once I got the hang of it, I noticed something: I no longer needed to set aside a Saturday afternoon for cleaning. There was nothing to clean in bulk because it all got handled whenever an issue sprang up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMy goals for the new year this time around are to stick with the momentum I built up working out and cleaning, but also improve my finances and notch some professional accomplishments I've been putting off during the year I spent on self-improvement. As soon as I finish this, I'm going to call one of the companies overseeing one of my 401k accounts to check on my rollover status, which is something I would have procrastinated on before entering my \"do it now\" era.Different things work for different people, but you can get caught up in thinking too much and doing too little. My technique doesn't come from a book and, I'll admit, does have to be abandoned sometimes when there are serious, large-scale projects that need to be broken down and handled systematically, but the beauty of it is that it leaves time and mental energy for doing that when I have to. \n            \n    ",

Steam Deck fans did take a bit of a hit towards the end of the year, when Valve announced it was discontinuing the $400 Steam Deck LCD, but for gamers on the other side of the price spectrum, Lenovo just announced the most powerful SteamOS handheld yet.It's technically not a new device, but instead, a reissue of a handheld from last year. Called the Lenovo Legion Go 2, it packs up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. It's also got detachable controllers like the Nintendo Switch, and uniquely, an 8.8-inch OLED display. And now, you can buy it with SteamOS officially installed out of the box (last year's release only came with Windows).If it's anything like the Legion Go S with SteamOS preinstalled, that means booting it up and navigating through your games will feel just like using a Steam Deck, which is great news for anyone who's a fan of Valve's lightweight and simple-to-use operating system, but is starting to feel like it might be showing its age. Not only should it prove easier to use than last year's Legion Go 2 with Windows installed on it, but the more powerful chip means the handheld will be able to play games much more smoothly and at higher resolutions than any other official SteamOS device yet. The hardware isn't made by Valve, but effectively, this is now a new, ultra-powerful Steam Deck sequel, and should be able to bump up your fps by up to dozens of frames in the right circumstances. For a measure of how transformative this can be, when the Legion Go S got SteamOS, it went from one of my least favorite handheld gaming PCs to my best pick for most people.\nEven those who already have the Windows version could see a performance increase, since SteamOS typically takes fewer resources to run than Windows, which can translate to smoother gameplay. You can see my review of the Legion Go 2 with Windows for more there, where I compare it to SteamOS devices. With this hardware combined with this operating system, this might be the most powerful handheld gaming PC you can buy right now, period.The only catch? This is still a bulky device, and while the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S saw a price cut over the Windows version (likely due to Valve not charging a licensing fee like Microsoft), the SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 actually starts off more expensive than the Windows version, at $1,199 rather than $1,099. That could be due to shortages on key components like RAM, but it is disappointing to see an already high price tag get higher when the precedent for SteamOS versions of these devices is for prices to come down.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nStill, the cheapest Windows model for the Legion Go 2 is actually a bit hard to find anywhere other than Lenovo's official store right now anyway, so it's possible that model could face its own price bumps in the near future as supply dwindles. And above four figures, one could argue that quality matters more than an extra $100 on the price tag.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGranted, you could get a Windows version and install SteamOS on it yourself, but doing so is a bit arduous, and can result in some unintuitive button mapping. The version with SteamOS installed out of the box, meanwhile, has a dedicated Steam button set-up from the get go. You'll have fewer headaches and a more intuitive setup by going for it.Aside from that button and the operating system, everything else about the device is the same as the Windows version, but that's not a bad thing. I called it \"overkill\" in my review, but that large OLED screen is gorgeous, and perfect for gamers who want the best looking graphics possible on the go. The original Legion Go 2 was my favorite premium gaming handheld of last year, and the model with SteamOS installed on it is only set to make it better.Valve gamers who think the Steam Deck OLED or Legion Go S aren't quite ritzy enough for them should stay tuned for the official release date, currently expected for June. This could be the premium handheld gaming PC they've been waiting for, marrying SteamOS convenience with modern specs that even the similarly priced Xbox handheld can't match. Finally, there's a \"Steam Deck\" for the 1%.\n            \n    ",

Cute.)What’s in the Pebble Round 2The Pebble Round 2 is a round smartwatch in a stainless steel frame. It’s about the same size and shape as the old Pebble Time Round, but has a much larger display area with nearly double the resolution, better visibility at an angle, a dramatically increased battery life, and—unusually for smartwatches these days—no heart rate sensor. The specs include: \n10 to 14 day battery life42 millimeter size, 8 millimeters thick (that’s thinner than every Apple Watch)Color e-paper screen (the same technology Garmin calls MIP)1.3-inch screen with 260x260 resolutionDual microphones for voice inputAccelerometerMagnetometerTouchscreenTakes a 20 mm watch band (black and brushed silver models), or a 14 mm watch band (brushed silver and rose gold models)Works with iOS and AndroidTracks steps and sleepEric Migicovsky, founder of both the original Pebble company and its modern incarnation Core Devices, told me the e-paper screen is the same one Garmin used in its old Forerunners. You may recall that I think the Forerunner 255 is one of the best-kept secrets in the smartwatch world, and that MIP screens have some advantages over the AMOLED displays that are more common these days. I’ll say more about this below, but the lack of a heart rate sensor is an interesting choice. The Pebble Round 2 can still track steps and sleep by sensing motion, so it’s not like health tracking features are totally missing. But it’s not going to measure your heart rate during workouts, nor try to capture heart rate and HRV while you sleep. How the Pebble Round 2 bucks the smartwatch trend (and why that’s probably a good thing)This is a really interesting list of specs, to me. Microphones for voice input are a new trend that’s been rolling out to more and more watches (both Garmin and Coros added them to more models this year). The battery life is a nice improvement, since the old Pebble Time Round only had about three days of battery life, and even today's smartwatches often struggle to get more than a few days. The thin build is impressive—I believe it’s the thinnest on the market right now. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nBut some aspects feel retro. The display technology is an older one that has seemd like it was on its way out. And the thing that I can barely wrap my head around as a fitness-focused writer is how do you release a smartwatch in 2026 that doesn’t have a heart rate sensor? This is madness! Or…is it?  Over the past few years, maybe the past decade, smartwatches and fitness watches have been converging on each other. It seems like each device wants to be able to say “we have that feature too!” so Oura now tracks activities instead of just sleep, Whoop tracks steps instead of just heart rate and HRV, and Apple—always willing to be seen as a fitness company, but always lagging behind on fitness features—finally, in 2025, gave us a real fitness app. Every watch these days has a heart rate sensor, every brand is ditching MIP style screens for AMOLED ones, and there’s no longer any categorical difference between smartwatches and fitness watches. Everything tries to do everything.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis trend isn’t necessarily good for users. For example: Garmin needed to add more features to the Forerunner 265 to justify a new model, but it already had pretty much everything a runner could ask for, at an already-premium price. So Garmin added a speaker and microphone to create the 570, and raised the price by $100. Should a middle-of-the-road running watch really cost $550? By contrast, the Pebble Round 2 leans into the things it’s good at (thin build, e-paper screen, microphone for input) and leaves off the things that, in theory, Pebble Round 2 users don’t care about. It’s missing both a heart rate sensor and a speaker, but its rectangular sibling the Pebble Time 2 has both. These two models sell for $199 and $225, respectively.I’m cautiously optimistic that Pebble’s approach might signal a change in the trend. Migicovsky wrote in a postmortem on the original Pebble company’s failure that Pebble could have kept its niche as “the smartwatch for hackers” but tried to be too many things to too many people. (In that same blog post, written in 2017 and updated in 2022, Migicovsky notes that the smartwatch market of 2015 was moving toward fitness, but Pebble wasn’t a fitness company and arguably shouldn’t have tried to be one.)“People want different things,” Migicovsky told me in a call earlier this week. He’s focusing Pebble’s new products on things he would want to use, not on what he thinks everybody else wants. That could be a risky move, since I’m not convinced that there’s a huge market for a heart-rate-less smartwatch. But I think he might be right that the smartwatch market is ready to stop being everything to everybody. \n            \n    ",

The device has a handle in addition to the footplate, which allows for extra sensors, and the new features include things like hypertension notifications that we've previously seen from smartwatches. (Hypertension notifications only just came to the Apple Watch a few months ago.) I got to see the Body Scan 2 at a CES event but haven't had a chance to use it for myself. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can measure \"60+ biomarkers\" that it says are relevant to tracking your health over time. With the caveat that I'm asking the company for more information on how this all works, I can say that it has more sensors than a typical smart scale and seems to be handling its data in a more sophisticated, and potentially more accurate, way. With sensors in your hands, and a small screen on the handle, it's able to measure and display the sort of data that you'd normally expect from a smartwatch. Smart scales generally aren't very accurate for data like body fat percentage, or really anything that goes beyond simple body weight. A typical smart scale runs a weak electrical current from one foot to another, measuring the electrical resistance of your lower legs. The Body Scan 2 adds a handle with electrodes, which brings the upper body into the mix. The screen on the handle also allows it to display data like ECG readings or other detailed results. Since the screen is in your hands, you don't have to squint at a display at your feet. (In product photos, the retractable handle sits on top of the footplate, but at yesterday's demo, Withings had the handles mounted on little holders at hand height.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThis setup allows for more detailed data than smart scales can usually measure. For example, a Withings rep told me yesterday that it can measure arterial stiffness by comparing the timing of your pulse in your torso, hands, and feet—the faster blood flows between these areas, the better. The Body Scan 2 uses impedance cardiography, a well-studied technology that can measure several aspects of heart health, and it includes a six-lead ECG. This means you can get ECG data and hypertension notifications—two headline Apple Watch features—without having to wear a watch every day. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe scale isn't yet available for sale, but Withings estimates that it will be available in the second quarter of this year, pending FDA clearance for some features. The price will be $599.95. Withings already sells a first-generation Body Scan scale, with a handle but with fewer sensors and without a screen on the handle, for $399.95. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Despite the conference not kicking off until Tuesday, the company shared details around its upcoming devices that are likely to launch this spring. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Petkit advertises all three pet devices as \"AI-powered,\" and while that's been a go-to gimmick for companies since 2023, there are some unique applications here—assuming the devices actually do what Petkit says they do. Purobot Crystal Duo litterboxPetkit says the Purobot Crystal Duo is the first AI-powered open-top litter box, and that the Purobot uses the tech for health detection. This device has an 720p AI-powered camera that monitors your cat's stools as well as their behavior when visiting the litter box. The Purobot looks at things like stool consistency and urine pH, as well as \"vocalizations,\" and noting all in the Petkit app. You can take any of those findings to your vet if you have concerns. Petkit says the Purobot uses crystal litter to absorb urine and dehydrate waste to manage odors. The company claims users can wait 30 days before needing to scoop the contents of the litter box, which also comes with disposable trays. The company plans to launch Purobot in July, on both Amazon as well as Petkit's official site. \nEversweet Ultra water dispenser Petkit's new water dispenser also uses an AI-powered camera to track health habits, only this time through your pet's \"hydration habits.\" The device ships with a 1080p camera with a 140-degree wide-angle view that tracks your pet as they drink, even in the dark. The Eversweet supports facial recognition for multiple pets, which, in theory, allows it to track the habits of specific pets drinking from the same device.The dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, which Petkit claims supports two full weeks of drinking water for one pet. The device detects when the water is low, and refills the bowl when needed, passing through a \"antibacterial filter cube\" to prevent bacterial growth. Any \"waste\" water is not recirculated through the dispenser, and is instead separated, so pets should always have fresh water while the reservoir is full.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nPetkit says the Eversweet Ultra may launch in April, though that's only an estimate. It, too, will be available on both Amazon, as well as Petkit's official site.  Perhaps Petkit's biggest announcement is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic feeder that works with wet food. This feeder can portion out fresh food for cats and dogs on a custom schedule, while tracking your pet's eating habits to build \"eating insights.\" Those insights are partially informed by the feeder's built-in 1080p AI-powered camera, with a 140-degree wide-angle view. It also supports facial recognition for multiple pets.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPetkit says the Yumshare Daily Feast supports up to seven days of fully automated wet meals—the keyword being \"automated.\" The machine opens each food pack itself, and each portion is \"kept within its freshness window.\" That means if your pet doesn't finish its meal, the device will take away the leftovers, and uses ultraviolet light (specifically UVC) to sanitize before delivering the next portion.  Petkit estimates it will release the Yumshare Daily Feast in April, both on Amazon as well as Petkit's official website. As with any new products, we'll have to wait until reviewers can perform hands-on testing before deciding whether these devices can actually achieve what they claim to. However, if Petkit's products are up to snuff, they could offer pet owners some legitimate benefits. The wet feeder really could be great for anyone who needs to leave their cat for long periods of time. The Purobot and Eversweet could also provide some essential health insights ahead of a vet visit: If you're seeing reports that your cat is crying while using the litter box, or isn't drinking as much water as they usually do, you could get ahead of a health problem by notifying your vet early.   \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Of course, a water dispenser should ideally do one thing: dispense fresh water for your pet. The Eversweet Ultra water dispenser, however, adds a number of smart features to the mix, some of which actually seem particular useful for owners of multiple cats.The Eversweet's camera tracks your cats' drinking habits I first learned about this water dispenser last week when Petkit officially announced it, and some of the specs and features are the same on paper as they are in person: This smart dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, as well as a 1080p camera with a 140-degree-wide-angle view. That allows you to see your cat approach the dispenser, as well as monitor their drinking habits. You can either choose to tap into a live stream to watch them as they drink, or check out prerecorded clips saved to the app. Petkit tells me the app even chops up clips for you to post to your socials automatically—if you think your friends and family want close-ups of your cat taking a drink. One of Petkit's selling points here, however, is the health tracking. The clips aren't just for posting to stories; instead, the camera can track how your pet drinks over time, noting any discrepancies or changes. You can see daily, monthly, and even yearly drinking trends, so you know whether your cat is drinking an abnormal amount of water for January. I'd want to consult a veterinarian before definitively stating whether this type of tracking is effective, but I can imagine it might be useful to know whether your cat changes its behaviors—something you might not notice if you aren't diligently watching them drink. \n\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThat doesn't change if you have multiple cats, either. The Eversweet's camera uses machine learning for facial recognition, and can identify individual cats in your home. That health tracking can apply to specific cats as they drink water, so you shouldn't have results mixed between your various pets. If you really want to know when one cat is drinking water over another, this should help you keep track.Eversweet's water featuresWhile some water dispensers recycle the water, the Eversweet disposes of the water after a set period of time. I knew about this from the press release, but it was fun seeing the machine dump the water in real time: The pump that serves to keep the water running cuts out, and the entire mechanism lifts up to reveal a drain. The water dumps out, and a spout refills the tank, only to dump the water again. This is an attempt to clean out the tray, and remove any bits of hair or debris that might've been left behind. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPetkit also made a point of showing me that the dispenser's pump is always running, which turns the Eversweet into a bit of a water feature—not that you should buy one just for decoration. The idea is, cats are a bit more attracted to the moving water than still water, which encourages them to drink. I don't have a cat, so I can't speak to that, but it's an added aesthetic perk—until the water dumps out, of course. Petkit says it's aiming for an April release for the Eversweet, which will be available on both Amazon as well as through Petkit's official site.\n            \n    ",

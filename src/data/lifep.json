Limit Precise Location is a new setting that prevents some Apple devices from broadcasting specific locations to cell carriers.Precise location sharing is useful, even essential, in some cases, such as when you're navigating with your maps app. But you may not want to constantly be sending your exact address to your phone provider, where it could be used for malicious purposes. If you enable Limit Precise Location, your iOS device will share your general area instead.  Precise location sharing comes with privacy risksAs TechCrunch points out, precise location sharing introduces a whole host of privacy and security risks. Cell carriers have been targeted by hackers, compromising sensitive customer data. Surveillance vendors and law enforcement agencies may also use location information broadcast via cellular networks for the purposes of real-time and ongoing tracking. \nUsers already have the option to disable precise location sharing at the app level on both iOS and Android for apps that don't need GPS coordinates to function—which is most of them. This allows you to prevent companies from receiving (and selling) your exact location data when a general location is sufficient. Limit Precise Location won't change these app-specific settings. For now, the feature is available only on select Apple models—the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular—running iOS 26.3 with a limited number of global carriers: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nU.S.: Boost MobileUK: EE, BTGermany: TelekomThailand: AIS, TrueApple says that even with this setting enabled, emergency responders will still be able to pinpoint exact location during an emergency call. How to disable precise location sharingIf you have a supported device with a partner carrier, go to Settings > Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options (you may need to select the specific line under SIMs if you have more than one). Scroll down and toggle Limit Precise Location sharing off. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to Google, feedback on the feature suggested it \"didn't provide helpful next steps\"—so while it alerted users when their data was out in the wild, it wasn't clear what to do about it. Now, Google is shifting its focus from the dark web monitoring tool to features like its online Security Check-Up and passkey protection. In other words, instead of flagging when your account credentials appear in a data breach, Google wants to make sure that your accounts stay safe even if a breach has occurred.There are reasons why you should be keeping an eye on dark web chatter, however—and there are tools to take over the monitoring job now Google has backed out.What is the dark web—and why do I need to monitor it?\n    \n            \n            Keeper provides a free dark web scan.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEssentially, the dark web is made up of online spaces that you can't get to just by pointing your browser at a web address. You need specialist software and a little bit of technical know-how to find your way into the dark web and to navigate around it. It's largely hidden from the world at large via encryption and rerouting. Why all the secrecy? The dark web is used to evade both law enforcement and ruling powers, so it's the perfect place to carry out somewhat illicit activities as well as get around the machinations of oppressive surveillance states. It's a place where hackers and whistleblowers alike can gather.\nSpeaking of hackers, dumps of information from data breaches will often find their way on to the dark web, to be traded or given away for free. Whether it's your email address, phone number, social security number, or passwords, if this data has been exposed by a hack, you're much more likely to find it on the dark web than on Reddit.Dark web monitoring tools, like the one Google just shut down, are intended to give you a heads up if your details have appeared in a data dump. You can then do something about it, whether it's getting in touch with your bank to check for any signs of identity theft, or changing the password for your email service.Having a dedicated tool for the task saves you from having to trawl the dark web yourself—which isn't particularly easy or pleasant—and while Google might be closing down its monitoring service, you've got several alternatives you can turn to instead.The best dark web monitoring tools you can try\n    \n            \n            Proton's dark web scanner is part of the Proton Unlimited subscription.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nProton is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and the privacy-focused company also has a Dark Web Monitoring tool of its own. You do need a paid plan to access it though, from $12.99 a month or $119.88 a year, which includes multiple perks across all Proton's products. You can find it from the Security and privacy side panel in the Proton Mail app.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nProton uses a variety of intelligence datasets in its dark web sweep, and looks out for details including email addresses, usernames, dates of birth, physical addresses, and government IDs. The leaks will be categorized in terms of how urgently action needs to be taken, and Proton doesn't give your data to third parties.Trend Micro has a Data Leak Checker that covers the dark web, which you can use without paying anything or even signing up for an account—though you can only check for mentions of your email address or phone number in leaks. For more comprehensive scans and alerts, you can sign up for a premium account, from $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year—and there's lots more included besides dark web monitoring.Keeper Security takes the same approach with BreachWatch: You can run a quick scan for breaches including your email address without paying or signing up, but if you want anything more advanced (including proactive notifications) then you need to sign up for $24.99 a year. The feature can be added to any of Keeper's other paid-for plans too.If you currently pay for a security product, such as a password manager or a VPN, you may well find that dark web monitoring is included—so check through your existing subscriptions. For example, the Surfshark Alert dark web monitoring tool comes as part of the Surfshark One VPN bundle, with pricing from $17.95 a month or $40.68 a year.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.Performing this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.Unfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"Well, dang. I've reached out to Google for additional comment, but it seems the eye of Sauron is upon us. Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying. One user said it's now been re-enabled on Brave, and I can confirm that I'm able to access it on Safari with my iPhone using the Vinegar extension.It's unclear how long these efforts will remain operational, but at least we've now been able to diagnose a cause. Free YouTube background play didn't break on accident, and that means developers and users will have to be extra crafty to keep the hack alive in the future. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It has a longer battery life and tiny tweaks that make a big difference, like a brighter screen, greater durability, and new software features. Right now, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm) is down 25% to $299 (originally $399), marking its lowest price ever on Amazon. \nIn PCMag's real-world testing, the watch delivered nearly two days of battery life and features a brighter screen with 2,000 nits of peak brightness. It’s also more rugged than its predecessor, with a harder, scratch-proof screen, a waterproof build (paired with a water temperature sensor and depth gauge up to 6 meters), and a dust-proof IP6X rating. It features Apple’s newest and smartest software, watchOS 26, which includes features such as Sleep Score metrics and enhanced safety alerts like life-saving hypertension notifications.Unlike the Apple Watch SE 3, for just $50 more at the current discount, the Series 11 has a thinner design with a larger display, and sensors that detect blood oxygen levels and ECGs, as well as other heart health and temperature sensors. The 11 also packs in an altimeter, gyroscope, compass, and ambient light sensor. Users can dive into their workout data via the iOS Fitness app, while the iOS Health app houses biometrics and ECG results. This model includes GPS, enabling real-time tracking of distance and pace during outdoor workouts. It also supports 5G connectivity, ensuring a stronger connection wherever you are.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re an iPhone user looking to upgrade your smartwatch or invest in a feature-rich one that’s ultra-durable, longer-lasting, and has 5G connectivity, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm), powered by watchOS 26, offers solid bang for your buck at its lowest-ever price of $299.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If someone can steal your device, especially if they know how to break into it, they have access to a huge amount of your sensitive data. As such, good security features can mean the difference between losing that data, or protecting it entirely—even if your phone is long gone. Google has a number of anti-theft features baked in Android, appropriately called \"Theft Protection Features.\" While the company isn't announcing a slate of new features today, it did announced new updates to its existing Android Theft Protection features in a post on the company's Security Blog Tuesday. Here's what's new:First, the company announced updates to authentication safeguards, which apply to all Android devices running Android 16 or newer. That includes a new dedicated toggle in settings for Failed Authentication Lock, which automatically locks your screen after someone tries to guess your password too many times. Now, you can choose whether or not to keep this feature on right from settings. Google is also increasing the amount of time your phone locks up after too many failed passcode attempts, which reduces the chance for someone to break into your phone. I wouldn't have thought of this, but Google notes that it has included protections against children that try to break into your phone, by not counting identical passcode attempts against this retry limit. And while it isn't new, Google highlighted that since late 2025, all features and apps that use Android Biometric Prompt now work with Identity Check, which prevents unauthorized users from changing sensitive settings without a successful biometric authentication—meaning a face or fingerprint scan. \nThe company also announced enhancements to features that are available to devices running at least Android 10. First is an update to Remote Lock, which lets you lock up your phone from a web browser if it is stolen or goes missing. Now, you can set up a security question as part of the unlocking procedure. Even if someone knows your credentials, they'd need to know the answer to your security challenge before they could unlock your device. Tip: If you make the answer something nonsensical, you'll be even more protected (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name? h7r_t*2#). Just be sure to file that answer somewhere safe, like a password manager.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsers in Brazil also have two new security settings enabled by default. The first is Theft Detection Lock, which can detect when your device has been snatched out of your hand in a likely theft situation. The second is Remote Lock, so users in Brazil can take advantage of the above benefits without having to set anything up first—other than the option security challenge question, of course. These updates might not be revolutionary, but they should help boost your Android's security a bit—and prevent your kids from locking you out of your phone for the day.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

However, those with access to sensitive data that are valuable to threat actors may benefit.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts. For most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)As noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality. \nHow WhatsApp's Strict Account Settings protects high-risk usersStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on. Link previews are disabledHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blockedOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile. Only known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.How to enable Strict Account Settings on WhatsAppThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings. Settings must be changed on your primary device and cannot be updated on the web. Note that the feature will roll out gradually over the coming weeks, and may not be immediately available. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Here are my tips on which products are likely to be a great buy, and which ones your better off waiting to pick up during a future sale.When is Presidents Day 2026?Presidents Day is a federal holiday that originally started to honor George Washington's birthday, but eventually evolved to recognize all U.S. presidents. Presidents Day falls on the third Monday of February each year, which means this year, it will take place on Feb. 16, 2026. Presidents Day sales, then, are usually concentrated on the weekend before the holiday, which means that this year, you're likely to see the biggest discounts from Feb. 13–16—and I wouldn't be surprised if some retailers start their sales even earlier.Presidents Day sales generally bring big discounts to items like home furnishings and mattresses, as well as major appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, and you can expect the same this year. As we're getting close to the end of winter, you'll likely also see price drops on winter gear like snow blowers, space heathers, and power generators, plus cold weather clothing like coats, as retailers try to sell down their inventory and make room for next season's items. You'll likely see some tech deals as well, as older model TVs and laptops will see price cuts to make room for newer models (some of which likely debuted at January's CES show). If you're planning to shop in one of these categories, start paying attention to prices now, so you'll be able to spot good discounts come the holiday weekend.What items aren't worth buying during Presidents Day sales?Seasons come and go, and even as retailers push their winter inventory out, they will try to sell you their spring products. You should hold off on picking these items up for now, as you'll likely be paying a premium price—even items that are \"marked down\" are likely to see bigger price cuts later, if you can wait.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWho will be holding Presidents Day sales?All major retailers will be having a Presidents Day sale, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others. The sales will generally be available both online and in-person (except at Amazon, of course).Should you wait for Amazon's Big Spring Sale? Presidents Day is a time-honored tradition, but in recent years, the biggest sale of the early part of the year has been Amazon's Big Spring Sale (with other retailers planning their own sales events around the same time). While we don't know the exact dates, its likely this year's will take place around the same time as last year—in mid- to late March. Is it worth waiting to shop until then? It depends on what you want to buy.The online retailer debuted the Big Spring Sale in 2024 with many sales on many different categories, but especially on tech, so if you're eyeing a specific tech product but haven't found a great deal yet, it's worth waiting to see if it is discounted in a month or so. However, if you're shopping for winter gear, mattresses, furniture, or large appliances, you'll likely see better discounts during Presidents Day sales.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension. Now, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.How to switch over to a Google accountFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:Open the Fitbit app.Sign in to your Fitbit account.Tap Settings and select Move account.Follow the on-screen instructions.During the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.It's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.What this means for youFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.There also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.Despite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to the settlement website, class payment distribution began on Jan. 23, and many users on Reddit report that funds have landed in their bank and payment apps over the last several days. If you see a deposit from \"Lopez Voice Assistant\" or some variation, it's not a scam. The settlement allowed class members to opt for payment via direct deposit (ACH) as well as electronic or paper check, which will be delivered through email or regular mail, respectively. Some class members are reporting that they received their funds via a different method than they expected, so if you submitted a claim, keep an eye on your transactions as well as your mailboxes to confirm receipt. Note that payouts are being distributed in batches and may take a few days to arrive. \nWhat is the Apple Siri settlement? Last year, Apple agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over privacy concerns with Siri-enabled devices. Users whose devices may have activated and recorded conversations without their knowledge were able to claim compensation. Initially, the settlement was set to pay out $20 per device—iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV were all eligible—for up to five devices per individual claimant. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, due to the final class size, the payout came to just $8.02 per device up to a maximum of $40.10. If you have questions about the settlement and want to speak with an administrator, you can call 888-981-4106 and select option 0 on the main menu.

This deal on a Eufy SoloCam E30 four-pack makes that math a little more palatable. It’s currently $299.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $549.99 price, which is the lowest price it's ever been, according to price-tracking tools. That brings each camera to about $75, which still isn’t cheap, of course—but unlike many other camera brands, these don't require a monthly subscription, which is a great perk.\nEach of these IP65-rated cameras runs on internal batteries that last about three months between charges, depending on how often motion is detected. Solar support helps extend that. Eufy says around two hours of direct sunlight per day is enough to keep them topped up. You can also hardwire the cameras if you want continuous recording, including short pre-roll clips, though the power cables are sold separately. You also get 360-degree pan and 70-degree tilt coverage per unit, which helps cut down on blind spots around driveways or yards. Video is captured in enhanced 2K resolution with an f/1.6 aperture, making nighttime footage via infrared night vision fairly crisp. There’s no built-in spotlight, so there's no color night vision here, but for general monitoring, black-and-white is often enough.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFootage can be stored locally on the included HomeBase S280, which has 16GB built in, or on a microSD card up to 128GB (sold separately) if you want more space. Smart home support includes Alexa and Google Assistant, but Apple HomeKit is not supported. Two-way audio is included, and the HomeBase can support up to 16 cameras, so expanding later is an option. This setup is not for people who want cloud storage or advanced smart home integrations. It makes more sense for those who want local control, predictable costs, and broad coverage without wiring the entire house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message. The healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text. Are you eligible for the Kaiser settlement? To qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to claim your settlement cashTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12. While the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That's 149 trillion gigabytes, or 149 billion terabytes—whichever helps you wrap your head around that gigantic number. Suffice it to say, the internet is a big place. It's so big, in fact, that you can't access all of it the same way. There are actually different tiers to the web, and depending on with tier a piece of content you're looking for is on, you may or may not be able to view it—even if you know where to find it. That's the crux of the difference between the \"surface\" web, and the \"deep\" web. These are two separate parts of the internet that are also part of the larger world wide web. While these two tiers are quite different, you've visited content on both of them before. In fact, you likely visited both surface web pages and deep web pages today, multiple times, without ever realizing it.    The surface web, also known as the visible web, is really true to its name: This is the part of the web you can easily access through search engines, as they are indexed by platforms like Google. As a rule of thumb, if you can google it, it's on the surface web. The article you're reading right now is on the surface web, for example. Maybe you found it by searching \"difference between surface web and deep web\" on Google. The same applies to Lifehacker as a whole, as well as articles on websites like Mashable, CNET, and PCMag.\nYou likely spend a good amount of your internet time on the surface web, on websites both old and new. Forums like Reddit are largely fully represented on the surface web, as are some Instagram pages. Listings for products you can buy on websites like Amazon and Best Buy are surface web pages. Video platforms like YouTube are very much the surface web, including TikTok—though the experience for the latter is not optimized for web browsers. Legacy websites like AddictingGames (which is still playable in 2026), as well as the site for the 1996 movie Space Jam are the surface web. A lot of the surface web is made of up individual articles, which makes sense, since articles still make up a large amount of search engine results.      Like the surface of the ocean, the surface web is just a fraction of the internet as a whole. Back in 2017, some estimates claimed the surface web made up just 10% of the entire internet. That's still a huge number of websites, which tells you how big the overall web really is.What is the deep web?If the surface web is everything you can find via Google, the deep web is everything you can't. The deep web is much larger than the surface web, and is compromised of websites that are not readily accessible from search engines or direct URLs. They're often locked away behind authentication. That means you need at least a username and password to access them, and in many cases, they require an additional form of authentication as well. The article you're reading is on the surface web, but the software (content management system, or CMS) we use to write and publish the article is not—our CMS is still a website, but it's not something you can find in a Google search, and even if you knew the direct URL, you wouldn't have access. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's the same with the many sites you access that only you have permission to view. Think about something like Gmail: The service's homepage is accessible to everyone, and it's something that pops up when searching \"Gmail,\" but to access your Gmail inbox, you need to log in. Once you do, your inbox is accessible via the website, but it's not like anyone can see it with a URL, and they certainly can't find your inbox from a Google search. It's the same story with your Facebook feed, YouTube account, or your banking information. These are all accessible in your web browser as websites, but you need to log in to view them. That's also the case for services and subscriptions. Think about  stuff like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO: These are all accessible in your web browser, which means you're streaming the content on individual web pages. But the players on those web pages cannot be accessed from Google, even if the landing pages for a particular show or movie can be. In order to actually watch or listen to the content, you need to sign into your account. That's not the case with all streaming services, of course: Happy Gilmore on Tubi is a surface web page, since it's indexed on Google. Some of the deep web is also made up of pages you'll never see, such as protocols for identifying user accounts and running payments behind the scenes. It's not all paywalled content. What about the dark web?Maybe you've also heard about the dark web, but don't quite know what it is. As such, you might conflate the deep web and the dark web, but the two are not identical. In fact, the dark web is a part of the deep web; it's just the part you can't access with a traditional web browser. In order to access the dark web, you need a specialized browser, like Tor, and knowledge of the unique dark web URLs, which typically end in .onion instead of .com or .org.

It’s selling for $1,698 on Amazon (down from $2,399.99) which is the lowest it’s been so far, according to price trackers. At this size, that discount meaningfully shifts the math, especially if you’re after a large screen from a brand known for dependable processing and a polished smart TV experience, rather than chasing raw specs alone.\nThe Bravia 5 steps is the successor to Sony’s X90L, swapping full-array local dimming for Mini LED backlighting and adding a higher number of dimming zones. It runs Google TV (version 12), supports Dolby Vision, and handles DTS audio passthrough. There’s also a practical perk for Sony soundbar owners: the TV’s built-in speakers can function as a center channel. On the gaming side, two HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K at 120Hz, along with variable refresh rate and G-sync compatibility. That said, Game Mode isn’t flawless. Pixel response times are on the slower side, which can introduce noticeable motion blur, particularly in fast-paced titles. SDR brightness is strong enough for daytime viewing, but HDR output doesn’t deliver the kind of punch you might expect from a Mini LED panel at this size and price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhere the Bravia 5 struggles most is contrast consistency and viewing flexibility. Despite the upgraded backlight, black levels and overall contrast don’t represent a major leap over the older X90L, and reflections can still be distracting in brighter rooms. The narrow viewing angle also limits its appeal for wide seating layouts. If pure picture performance is the priority, competing Mini LED models from TCL or Hisense, or even some OLED options, offer stronger contrast for similar money. Still, for buyers who value Sony’s processing, Google TV’s clean interface, and long-term brand reliability, this price drop makes the 85-inch Bravia 5 a far more compelling option than it usually is.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Right now, the brand's flagship headphones, the Beats Studio Pro, are on sale for $169.95 (originally $349.99), the second-lowest price they have been, according to price-tracking tools. \nThe Beats Studio Pro came out in 2023 with a \"good\" review from PCMag, praising their sculpted sound, comfort, premium accessories, and spatial audio with head tracking for an immersive experience—but the review warned that hardcore audiophiles might not be as impressed. PCMag also said you can get much better headphones for less than their $349.99 price (which is very true) that have adjustable EQ and better active noise cancelling (ANC). However, at $169.95, these headphones are a great deal, especially if you're an Apple user.These headphones have hands-free Siri access, one-touch pairing on iOS and Android devices (through Google Fast Pair), which gives simultaneous connections with up to two devices, and a transparency mode that lets you hear your surroundings. Apple users will be able to take advantage of the AAC codecs, which work seamlessly with Apple tech to give much better audio quality. You get a quick-access menu to control the ANC and Transparency modes, and you can also use the Find My app if you misplace your headphones. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe biggest miss with the Beats Studio Pro that you would expect any premium headphones to have is adjustable EQ. However, they have plenty of EQ presets for you to choose from. The ANC is slightly above average, which is good for its current price. You can get about 40 hours of playtime at full charge with ANC and Transparency modes off, and a 10-minute charge gives you about four hours of juice.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For a Mac user, Safari might be the best browser there is (yes, even better than Chrome). It's fast, secure, doesn't buckle under most loads, sips RAM instead of munching through it, and it'll help your battery last longer as well. And yes, there are even extensions and ad blockers that work natively in Safari. It's time to take another look at Safari, and use all its hidden features and smarts to make your browsing better. Blast away ads and other distracting items\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nWhen this feature came out, it became a bit of a meme on TikTok. In case you haven't heard, Safari has a new Hide Distracting Items feature that can zap pretty much anything on a webpage out of existence. You'll find in the page options menu (the - icon to the left of the address bar). After activating it, try clicking on a popup menu, autoplaying video, newsletter box or pretty much anything else. It'll be banished from your screen, and there will even be a little animation showing it disappearing like it's just been snapped by Thanos. And Safari will remember your snap, so it won't show up the next time you visit that site on your Mac, or even your iPhone or iPad. And if you're feeling more like Iron Man, yes, you can cancel your snaps.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nFor ad blocking, Firefox and Chrome have the uBlock Origin extension. Then there are browsers like Brave and Opera, which come with ad-blocking built-in. Safari has always suffered in this regard. There was never really a true alternative to uBlock available for Safari. There is a version of uBlock Origin for Safari, but it doesn't use Safari's own framework for ad-blocking, so it suffers when it comes to performance and blocking capabilities.But now it seems like there's finally a decent alternative, called wBlock. I've been using it ever since my colleague, Justin Pot, wrote about it, and I am happy to say that it finally makes Safari's ad-blocking experience on par with some of the bigger browsers. And the best part? wBlock is free and open-source.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nBefore development was suspended, I loved the Arc browser. But ever since the company shut it down, I have become jaded, and I haven't really started using alternatives like the Zen Browser. The biggest features I miss from Arc are the workspaces and vertical tabs. But now, Safari has those too. In Safari, you can now create Tab Groups, which can contain as many tabs as you want. I use these as my workspaces. One group for reading long articles, another for travel research, and so on.And while I'm in a tab group, I also like to do it with the sidebar open (click the Sidebar button next to the Back and Forward buttons), which gives me a vertical-tabs experience similar to Arc's. It isn't exactly like Arc, because the horizontal tab bar up top doesn't disappear. But having a vertical list of tabs still helps. So does the fact that Tab Groups sync with my iPhone and iPad, so I can pick up my research there as well.To create a new tab group, click the New Tab Group button at the top of the sidebar. Or you can select multiple tabs, right-click, and choose the Move to Tab Group > New Tab Group option. On the iPhone, open the tab switcher, tap the Menu button from the top, and choose New Empty Tab Group to get started.Master Safari's new design for iPhone\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nSafari was one of the few apps that saw a major design update in iOS 26, with a redesigned bottom bar. Lifehacker has a detailed guide on all the new hidden gestures and features in Safari's iOS 26 redesign, but I'll highlight some of my favorites here.Swipe to switch tabs: To quickly switch between tabs, just swipe left or right on the address bar.Press and hold the address bar: A lot is hidden here. You can copy a link, paste from your clipboard, switch to another tab group, close tabs, or close all tabs.Swipe up on the address bar: Swipe up on the address bar to reveal all open tabs. From here, you can swipe left or right to switch between tab groups. From the top menu, you can copy links for all open tabs with ease.Pin tabs: Tap and hold a website from the tabs screen, and choose the Pin Tab option to pin the website to the top of your browser.Bring back the iPhone's old tab bar\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nIf you don't like the iPhone's new compact tab bar or its gestures, you can still go back to the way things used to be. Go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Tabs. Switch to the Bottom option to bring back the expanded bottom toolbar, or to go further back in time, go with the Top option.Lead separate browsing lives using Profiles\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nIt's not as obvious as in Chrome, but Safari also has profiles that sync between iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can use Profiles to keep your work and personal lives separate. This can also be useful if you and your spouse use the same Mac.Profiles will fully separate your browsing from other users, including logins, cookies, browsing history, tab groups, favorites, and even extensions.To set one up for Safari on Mac, go to Settings > Profiles. On the iPhone, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Profiles and tap New Profile. Give it a name, and make sure to pick an icon and color. This will tint the background of the start page, so it'll find it easier to know which profile you're in.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTurn your favorite sites into apps\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nOn Mac, you can use Safari to turn any frequently used website into an app of its own. It will show up in the Dock and the app-switcher. It's still the same website, but it will have its own shortcut on your Mac's interface, making it easier to use. If you use your Mac for retail, or any kind of specialized work that happens via a website, this can be really handy.To do this, visit a website, click the Share button, and click Add to Dock. Your logins will sync automatically, and so will your extensions. The toolbar will be colored based on the website colors as well.You can also do this on iPhone, by navigating to a site, tapping the Share button, tapping More, and tapping Add to Home Screen. The website's logo will show up as an \"app\" on your home screen, and it'll act as a shortcut to the site.Automatically close open tabs\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nI love opening tabs, but I hate closing them. That means it's easy for me to hit the 500 tab limit in Safari. So I enabled the option that automatically closes tabs that are older than 30 days. You can do this by going to Settings > Apps > Safari > Close Tabs. You can choose between one day, one week, or one month.Listen to a page out loud\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nYou might be familiar with Safari's Reader Mode, which is perhaps the best in the business. But there's another feature hidden in the Page Settings option. Tap the Listen to Page button, and Safari will instantly start reading the site you're on out loud. Before doing this, though, I would recommend you switch to Reader Mode first, so the text-to-speech doesn't get caught on ads or other distractions. Customize or change the Safari start page\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nEvery time you open Safari, or a new tab, you see the browser's default start page. Let's take some time to customize just how it looks and works. First, open the start page, then click the Edit button in the bottom-right corner to enable or disable which sections you want to see. I suggest adding sections for your Favorites, Reading List, iCloud Tabs, and Recently Closed Tabs. You can also change the background to any color that you like. If you don't like an overloaded start page, you can also try out the Bonjourr Safari extension. It's a start-page replacement that I've used for months now. It automatically cycles between serene backgrounds while showing the time and weather. You can add quick shortcuts for your frequently visited sites, too. It's also fully customizable, and looks great on iPhone as well as Mac.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        If you find yourself in an emergency or crisis situation, the more information you can give first responders, the better. Android users can now share a live stream of their surroundings with 911, allowing emergency services to assess and provide guidance in real time while you wait for help to arrive onsite.Emergency services on AndroidYour Android already shares some information with first responders via Emergency Location Services (unless you disable this feature). This built-in tool sends an accurate location as well as contextual information, such as language settings, when you call or text an emergency number. Now, that includes live video from your device's camera. You don't need to do anything to set up Emergency Live Video. Once available in your area, responders can send a request during an emergency call or text to securely share your camera's live video. You'll see a prompt on your screen to start sharing with one tap. According to Google, Emergency Live Video is encrypted by default. Users can choose whether to share their video from the prompt as well as stop the share at any time by clicking the onscreen Stop sharing button. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLive video sharing is rolling out now to U.S. users, as well as those in parts of Germany and Mexico, on Android phones running Android 8 and up. Google says they are partnering with public safety organizations to expand the feature to more users. Other Android safety featuresEmergency Live Video is the latest in Google's suite of safety features designed to make help more accessible—more quickly—in an emergency. Pixel users in Australia, North America, and several dozen countries across Europe now have access to Satellite SOS, which allows you to call emergency services even without a cellular or wifi connection. Car Crash Detection contacts emergency services and shares your location in the event of severe crash, while Fall Detection and Loss of Pulse Detection will call for help based on Pixel Watch sensor data. \n            ",

In fact, roughly half of FSA holders in recent years have ended up forfeiting funds to their employers, according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).First, make sure to double-check with your employer about your FSA's Dec. 31 deadline, along with any potential rollover or grace period. After that, it's time to scan your medicine cabinet, make a list of anything you need to stock up on, and click \"add to cart.\" The FSA store is an obvious choice for making the most of your remaining funds, but you can also turn to your go-to retail giants. Amazon, Target, Walgreens, and more all offer a dedicated FSA/HSA Shop to help you find eligible items quickly.\nHow to shop FSA-eligible items on AmazonHere's how you can take advantage of Amazon's FSA-eligible items before the end of the year.1. Visit Amazon's FSA Store at amazon.com/fsa2. Look for the \"FSA/HSA Eligible\" label on product listings\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n3. Use the FSA/HSA filter in search results4. Pay with your FSA debit card at checkout\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSimilarly, Target has an FSA filter in their healthcare section, and pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens have dedicated online FSA shops.What to buy with your remaining FSA fundsMany over-the-counter medications and health items are FSA-eligible, including pain relievers, cold medicine, bandages, dental care products, menstrual products, and more. But did you realize you can also snag these kinds of goodies:First aid suppliesContact lenses and solutionsReading glassesFancy sunscreenBlood pressure monitorsEpsom saltMassage gunsPimple patchesAn Oura ringA WHOOP bandA $229.99 water dental flosserAgain, most FSA plans require you to spend funds by Dec. 31, though some offer grace periods. Check with your plan administrator for specific deadlines. Just make sure to save receipts for all FSA purchases in case you need to verify eligibility with your plan administrator after paying.However you choose to spend your FSA funds, don’t let that money go to waste. After all, this money already came out of your paycheck.\n            \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        One of the ways AI models are rapidly improving is in their image editing capabilities, to the extent that they can now quickly take care of tasks that would previously have taken a substantial amount of time and effort in Photoshop. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons Adobe has decided to introduce its own ChatGPT plug-ins.Want your t-shirt to be blue rather than red? Need to cut out a person or an object from an otherwise perfect group selfie? These are tricks that AI chatbots are now able to do cleanly and professionally, from just a text prompt. You don't need to have any digital photo editing skills; you only need to describe what you want to happen.Over the past few months, both Gemini and ChatGPT have become better at more precise edits. They're able to tweak part of an image and leaving the rest of it untouched, rather than rendering everything again from scratch just to alter one detail. Now Gemini has quietly added some more markup tools for this job.Marking up images in GeminiGoogle hasn't said anything officially about these markup tools, which suggests the feature is still in testing (it's also previously been spotted by the team at Android Authority). If you're not seeing these tools, try quitting and restarting the Gemini app on mobile, or refreshing the app on the web—and if you still can't see the options after that, you may have to be wait a little bit longer If this functionality has rolled out to you, you should be able to upload an image in a chat using the + (plus) button in the prompt box, and then tap or click on the image thumbnail to find the markup tools. At the moment, they only show up before the image has been edited—you can't find them after you've started generating edits.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Look out for this pop-up to see if you have the new feature.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe easiest tool to understand is the drawing tool, which is enabled via the icon that looks like a scribble. You can use this to highlight a particular part of an image—a space in the sky, a lamppost in the street, a face in a crowd—and then describe the change you want Gemini to carry out.For example, rather than just saying \"add a cartoon dragon in the sky\" in your prompt, you can actually combine that prompt with a circle on the image showing exactly where the dragon should go. It gives you even more of that Photoshop-level precision, without cluttering up the interface too much.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe scribblings can also be used if you're asking questions about the image. For example, you could circle an actor or an object in a scene and then ask \"who is this?\" or \"what is this?\" in the attached prompt. In that sense it works in a similar way to the Circle to Search feature that's available for images on Android.\n    \n            \n            You can add scribbles and text to your images.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere's also a text tool—the T icon—but I'm not sure exactly how you use this (and there's no official help available yet). You can use it to describe changes you want to apply to your picture (like \"an add arrow here\"), but the text stays in place—it's almost like a rudimentary text overlay feature, with a choice of colors but no font or styling options.You can use the prompt to manipulate the text you've added, adding outlines and backgrounds for example, so perhaps that's the way it's intended to be used: a more precise editing option, but for text. Presumably once these tools have reached all Gemini users, we'll get some more information from Google on how to use them—but you may well find they're available to you now.\n            ",

Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act. To activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\" This is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        You (hopefully) know by now that you can't take everything AI tells you at face value. Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices. The campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms. How attackers are using ChatGPT Kaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas. However, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.A further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem. Don't trust every command AI generatesIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past. Of course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't. \n            ",

As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.  Lookalike domains contain malicious contentThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes. In some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware. Infoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to avoid parked domain scamsOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site. I've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.At least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.The free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.I tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This one is a slide deck generator, which can be useful if you need to make a presentation in a hurry, but I've been using it a little differently to help myself retain new information. Generating a slide deck in NotebookLMFirst, you should know how to generate a deck. In case you're unfamiliar with NotebookLM, it's basically just like ChatGPT, but instead of pulling answers from the big, wide Internet, it only relies on PDFs, links, videos, and text you input as resources. This makes it the perfect tool for working on a specific project or studying for a class, since you don't run the risk of inadvertently getting misled by some random, unrelated source. You can use the chat bot feature the way you would ChatGPT, asking questions and getting summaries of your materials. You can also automatically generate flashcards, videos, infographics, mind maps, fake podcasts, and much more. To generate slides, it's the same process you'd follow to make those: In the left-side panel, select all of the sources you want the tool to pull from. In the right-side panel, select Slide Deck from the menu. After a few minutes, you'll get slides you can download as a PDF, the same as you would if you were downloading a PowerPoint, and you can upload those to Google Slides or PowerPoint to create a simple presentation.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy I like NotebookLM's slide deck featureI've mentioned before that while I love NotebookLM and use it every day for both work and personal pursuits, I can't stand its app. It just doesn't work nearly as well as the browser version, which is a shame because the browser version works so well. I pretty much ignore the app and don't use NotebookLM on mobile or, when I do, I use my mobile browser to access it, which we all know is an annoying workaround that never quite translates right on the smaller screen. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nWith the slide PDF, however, I get a ready-made study guide complete with visuals, which I can send to myself via iMessage and study on the go. When I generate my own study materials without NotebookLM, I almost always do it in Google Slides, then download the full PDF and review the slides like a giant study guide, so this new feature is taking a bunch of the work out of doing that for me. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Your information may have been compromised in a massive breach affecting more than 5.8 million consumers, and you should take the necessary steps to protect your data. 700Credit supplies credit and identity verification services to more than 21,000 vehicle, RV, powersport, and marine dealerships in the U.S., so if you've purchased a vehicle and applied for dealer financing—or even been pre-screened or pre-qualified to do so—your information could have been affected. What happened with 700Credit?According to the company's filing with the Maine Attorney General, 700Credit's systems were hacked between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27. Attackers stole personal information about customers of 700Credit's dealership clients, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and dates of birth. As BleepingComputer reports, this breach was actually a consequence of a system compromise back in July at one of 700Credit's 200 integration partners. Threat actors were able to gain access to an API used to pull consumer data, and a security vulnerability in the API allowed them to exfiltrate information from 700Credit. What you need to doIf you receive a data breach notice from 700Credit, read it carefully. 700Credit is offering 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion's Cyberscout to affected consumers. You will need to go to the URL listed in your notice and enter your unique activation code in order to enroll, and you have 90 days from the date of the letter to complete the process. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n700Credit expects to begin notifying individuals starting on Dec. 22. In addition to utilizing the free credit protection, you should take the usual precautions to lock down your identity: Freeze your credit at all three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion).Place a fraud alert on your credit file. You only need to do this at one bureau, which will apply it to all three. Keep an eye on your financial accounts for suspicious transactions as well as your credit report.

And it’s the At a Glance widget on top the screen that Google just won’t let me remove. I like a clean lock screen, and eventually, I got so frustrated looking at this totally uncustomizable widget that shows the time and the weather that I gave up and switched to Niagara Launcher. And if you think that this is just my own pickiness, I can confidently say it’s not just me; Reddit is filled with people complaining about this.But seems like after 10 iterations of Pixels, Google is finally letting people get rid of this widget, clearing space for something, anything better than this. The new option will be part of Android 16’s QPR 3 update, which will be out sometime in March 2026. But if you install the beta, you can try it now.How to install Android 16 QPR 3 beta 1Android’s QPR betas are refreshed every quarter, and anyone with a compatible Pixel device can enroll. Visit the Android Beta Program website and enroll your device. Reboot, and you’ll be on the beta channel. It’s really easy to hop on, and it won’t require a factory reset. But getting rid of an installed beta is not so easy. Once you install the latest QPR 3 beta, you’re in for the long haul, at least until Android 16 ships the stable version in March. If something goes wrong, or if you’re facing battery issues, the only way to downgrade would be to wipe your device. So before you start, make sure you have a full backup.At a Glance is an interesting idea, but it's rarely helpful. It's supposed to show you relevant information like the weather, your next appointment, alerts, air quality, and even suggestions from fitness apps and delivery updates. But instead, what it shows is unpredictable and pretty barebones, and it takes up valuable screen real estate. Worse, you can't customize it to make it better.

The latest macOS update (26.2) has a trick for this: you can use the edge of your screen as a ring light.The feature, which adds a rounded white rectangle to your screen, is called Edge Light. The rectangle takes up part of your screen but will become partially transparent if you move your mouse pointer into it, meaning you'll mostly be able to use your computer normally.You can use the feature by clicking the camera icon on the menu bar during a call and toggling on the Edge Light option. You can also adjust the brightness and the color of the edge light from here.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this in a well-lit room and didn't notice much of a difference, which makes sense. In a totally dark room, though, it proved extremely helpful. Here's how I looked without Edge Light:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAs you can see, I'm just barely lit by the laptop itself.

And then sticking to a plan once you've made it? Even harder. This is where RPM can help. The Rapid Planning Method, or RPM, can help you streamline your daily planning process and get started working on your action steps sooner, making you more productive overall. Plus, since RPM is fairly straightforward, you're more likely to stick with it.  What is the Rapid Planning Method (RPM)?This technique comes from famed motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who outlined it in his Time of Your Life program. Robbins may have a slightly cheesy rep, but RPM has the goods: Not only does does the acronym stand for Rapid Planning Method, but it can also serve as a guide to what your day should look like: Results-oriented, purpose-driven, and featuring a massive action plan. It starts with asking yourself three questions consistently—every morning, for instance, or every week:What do I want?What is my purpose?What do I need to do/What is my massive action plan?You can write down your answers or just keep them in mind, but they're intended to drive you forward into action that will be efficient and lead to accomplishing your ultimate goal. For best results, I do recommend writing the answers down in a planner, so you can stick your guiding principles somewhere you'll continually see them. Actually, I just recommend writing them down in general. Having to hand-write something helps commit the information to memory. How RPM makes you more productiveThere are a whole lot of productivity methods out there—and the benefit of RPM is that it can be easily combined with many of them. For example, you can implement a 1-3-5 to-do list as part of your overall action plan. The defining feature of RPM is that it keeps your goals and desires front and center, giving you something to strive for. and organize your actions around. Just by keeping that central plan in mind, you can weed out what isn't important and highlight what you want to prioritize, all without a lot of time-wasting deliberation. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOverall, I recommend sticking with productivity techniques that revolve around larger, bigger-picture goals and clearly-defined purposes. When you fail to keep your dreams and loftier ambitions in mind, it can be hard to motivate yourself to complete the tedious, smaller steps that add up to them. Another solid option for this kind of broader thinking is the MIT method. Like using SMART goals, using RPM infuses your daily tasks with a sense of purpose or a mission, helping you stay focused and engaged. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        You can do a lot with Android Auto, but what you can't do is install a web browser—at least not with the default, out-of-the-box configuration. It is actually possible to get a window on to the web with a little bit of tweaking, and the help of the open source AA Browser built especially for Android Auto.Getting a web browser up on your car dashboard may not seem like much of an improvement over browsing on your phone screen, but it also enables another feature on your vehicle's display: video playback. Through AA Browser you can get at pretty much any streaming site you want and load up some video.Some serious safety warnings are required here, though. You should only load up videos on your car's Android Auto screen when you're parked, stationary, and not going anywhere. Watching anything on the move—whether it's on your phone or on your vehicle dashboard—not only risks your life, it risks the lives of everyone else on the road with you.In fact, AA Browser will disable itself while your vehicle is moving, but it's worth giving out the warning in any case, for this and any other app. With that out of the way, here's how you can load up a web browser on Android Auto, and make your parked-up time inside your car more entertaining.Browser setup and installationLike Android as a whole, Android Auto has a developer mode that gives you access to a selection of extra settings. From Settings on Android, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixels) or just Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy phones). Scroll down to the bottom of the screen, tap Version, then tap Version and permission info seven times.You should then see a pop-up asking you if you're sure you want to enable developer settings for Android Auto, so tap OK to confirm. You then need to open up the AAAD (Android Auto Apps Downloader) app APK in your phone's browser, tapping through the security warnings about running non-Play Store apps on your device if they show up.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            AAAD will give you access to the AA Browser.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAAAD gives you access to a selection of Android Auto apps that haven't been specifically approved by Google, including AA Browser. Tap through the various introduction screens, give the app the permissions that it needs to install other apps, and then find AA Browser in the list of available apps. Tap Install and then tap through the confirmation pop-ups to get the app on your phone.You'll be asked if you want to open AA Browser straight away: You can use it as a normal web browser on your phone, though there's not really much to look at. It's designed to be used primarily on your Android Auto screen, and it should now show up as an available app when your phone is connected to your vehicle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsing AA Browser in your carProvided you're safely stopped in your vehicle, you can launch AA Browser from the main apps list on the Android Auto interface (you may also get a prompt to launch it the first time you connect, after installing the app). You get taken to the Google Search homepage to begin with, and from there you can go anywhere you like.As with any other Android Auto app, if you tap inside an input field, you'll see a keyboard pop up on screen that you can use to enter web addresses and login credentials, and you can use the touchscreen to navigate around. To get to the URL address bar, tap anywhere on screen, then tap the blue arrow in the lower left corner.\n    \n            \n            Entering and editing URLs in AA Browser.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe next screen also gives you options for going back through your browser history and accessing your bookmarks—a handy way of making sure you can jump back to the sites you need without having to tap our their URLs every time. There's also the option to request the desktop versions of sites rather than the mobile versions.While certain sites don't seem to like the AA Browser, most of the pages I've visited work fine on Android Auto. To quit the browser, you can either tap the Exit button in the top right corner (if it's visible), or swipe up or down from the top or bottom edges of the Android Auto screen to go back to your other apps.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Between the sheer number and the increasing sophistication of phishing campaigns, seeing should not automatically be believing when browsing online. One particularly sneaky scam is a browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack, in which threat actors create a fake browser window that looks like a trusted single sign-on (SSO) login page within a real browser session. Because we use SSO to access many of our online accounts, we may not think twice before entering usernames and passwords on these spoofed pages. Cybercriminals are counting on this to steal user credentials.Rather than redirecting users to a spoofed website, threat actors running a BitB attack create a fake pop-up within the page you're already on (which may either be set up for the attack or compromised in some way). Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they're able to design a login window that looks exactly like the real one, right down to the lock icon and URL in the pop-up's address bar. These fake login windows typically appear in a seamless fashion, such as after a click or redirect you're expecting to lead to SSO. Obviously, entering your credentials hands them directly to the attackers, who can either use or sell them. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nFraudulent pop-ups often imitates SSO such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft, though they may exploit any login portal. Earlier this year, researchers at Silent Push identified a BitB phishing campaign targeting Steam users, specifically those playing Counter-Strike 2. Gamers saw a fake browser pop-up window displaying the URL of the real Steam portal, making them more likely to enter their credentials without suspicion. The attackers also featured the likenesses of eSports team NAVI to lend credibility. Signs of a BitB scamBecause threat actors are able to so closely imitate trusted sign-on pages, including using the real domain in the address bar, a visual inspection may not be enough to catch the fraud. Instead, you need to interact with the window in some way. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn many cases, a genuine SSO pop-up can be dragged around and away from the browser page it appears on top of, so you can first try to move it elsewhere on your screen. However, some SSO dialogs are static, so if you can't drag it, try to highlight the URL or click the padlock icon to show certificate details. If these elements are fake, you won't be able to interact with them at all because the window itself is just an image. This is also an excellent reason to use a secure password manager to fill your credentials instead of entering them manually. A password manager will work only on the legitimate domain. If it doesn't autofill, don't automatically override it—check to ensure the pop-up is real. You should also have a strong form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled wherever possible, so even if your username and password are somehow compromised, attackers won't have the additional factor needed to actually access your account. Note that hackers can still phish some forms of authentication—physical keys along with biometrics and passkeys are the most secure options. \n            ",

Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation. These aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before. While in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business. ChatGPT's \"app store\" isn't really a store\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.Here are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:Adobe AcrobatAdobe ExpressAdobe PhotoshopAgentforce SalesAha!AirtableAllTrailsAmplitudeApple MusicAsanaAtlassian RovoAzure BoardsBasecampBooking.comBoxCanvaClayCloudinaryConductorCourseraDaloopaDoorDashDropboxEgnyteExpediaFigmaGitLab IssuesGoogle DriveHelp ScoutHexHighLevelHugging FaceInstacartIntuit Credit KarmaIntuit MailchimpIntuit TurboTaxKhan AcademyKlaviyoLinearLovableLSEGMonday.comMorningstarNetlifyNotionOpenTableOutlook CalendarOutlook EmailPeloton PipedrivePitchBookRampReplitSharePointSlackSpotifyStripeTargetTeamsTeamwork.comTheForkThumbtackTripadvisorUberUber EatsVercelZillowZohoZoho DeskZoomIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced. \n            \n    ",

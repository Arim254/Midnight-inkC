The platform is speedy, simple, and supports just about every streaming app out there.If you've got a Roku or two in your life, you may not be using it to its full potential. These tips, hacks, and hidden features should help you go beyond the basic business of launching your streaming apps and get more out of your hardware, whether you've just unboxed your first Roku device, or you've been using one for years.Set up PIN protection to protect your RokuIf you've got young kids or nosy housemates living with you, you can lock certain parts of the Roku experience (including making purchases and adding new channels) behind a PIN number. This is actually done through your Roku account page on the web: Click PIN/parental controls on the left, and you can set a new PIN or change an existing one.Change the look and feel of your Roku with a new themeYou don't have to settle for the standard Roku interface visuals—you can easily switch to a different theme (which basically means a different wallpaper and screensaver). From Settings on your device, choose Themes to see alternatives provided by Roku and other people in the Roku community. You can always pick Restore default theme to go back to the original look.Enable captions on replayYou might not want closed captions on all the time, but you can have them enabled whenever you skip backward. From the home screen, pick Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode > On replay to enable this. Note that the streaming app you're using needs to support the feature as well, so it may not work everywhere.Put your most-watched apps up topThis is a simple and effective one that you might not have got around to doing: You can organize the apps on the home screen so your most-used are nearer the top and easier to get to. Select any tile on the home screen, press the star button on your remote to bring up the context menu, and you'll see the Move app and Move app to top options.Make use of Guest Mode when you have company\n    \n            \n            Roku devices come with a Guest Mode included.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's great having guests—but don't let them mess up your recommendations and viewing progress. You can put your Roku device into Guest Mode by opening Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Guest Mode > Enter Guest Mode. You'll be signed out of all your apps, and the Roku device will restart ready for someone else to use it.Send your photos to your Roku to view them on the big screenYou won't always be watching films and shows on your Roku of course—and when your streaming device isn't doing anything else you can get images from your Google Photos library up on your TV. To set this up, you need to head to the Photostreams page on the Roku website, sign in using your account, and then follow the instructions online.Set up a cross-platform Roku watchlistThere will often be times when you see something interesting, but don't have time to watch it right away, and that's when the Roku watchlist feature can help. Select any movie or show from the home screen, and on the listing page use the Save button to add it to your list: You can then pick Save List from the main menu to see what you've saved.Pair your Bluetooth headphones to your RokuIf you've got a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and a Roku device that supports Bluetooth, you can pair the two together for some private audio listening— handy if you don't want to disturb anyone around you. You can do this by heading to Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Remotes & devices > Wireless headphones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nListen to your Roku via your smartphoneThere's another way to listen through headphones, and it doesn't require Bluetooth or wireless headphones. If you install the aforementioned Roku app on your smartphone, then plug a pair of headphones into your phone as well, you can tap Remote control in the app and then the headphone button to stream the audio right to your ears.\n    \n            \n            You can use the mobile app to listen over headphones.\n                                        Credit: Roku\n                    \n    \nMirror your other devices to your RokuApple devices: Roku sticks, boxes and TVs come with support for the Apple AirPlay standard built right in, so you can beam across audio and video from Apple devices, or even mirror your Mac display on the big screen. On the Roku, choose Settings then Apple AirPlay and HomeKit to make sure you're set up, then just select the AirPlay button on your Apple hardware.Android devices: For screen casting, you're not left out if you're on Android, though—as usual with Android—capabilities vary between devices. Samsung Galaxy phones have the smoothest integration: Swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen, choose Smart View, and your Roku should show up as a connection option (if it's on the same wifi network).Windows devices: If you want to mirror your screen to a Roku from Windows, the process is different again. First, enable the feature on the Roku via Settings > System > Screen mirroring. Next, from Windows, click the volume and wifi icons down in the lower right corner, click the Display button, then select your Roku. Again, it needs to be on the same wifi network.Quickly find the cheapest way to rent a show or movieIf you're in the mood for a movie rental, then you've got a whole host of different streaming services to choose from—all the big ones offer film rentals on top of the content you get with your subscription. Use the Search option from the main Roku menu to look for a title, and compare the different prices across all the services you're signed up to.Control your TV with your Roku remoteYou can turn your TV on and off and adjust its volume with your Roku remote, if you'd like to. You're asked if you want to do this when you first set up your Roku device, but you can configure it afterwards too: Pick Settings > Remotes & devices > Remotes, then choose the remote you've currently got connected, and then pick Set up remote for TV control.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    ",

Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension. Now, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.How to switch over to a Google accountFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:Open the Fitbit app.Sign in to your Fitbit account.Tap Settings and select Move account.Follow the on-screen instructions.During the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.It's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.What this means for youFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.There also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.Despite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This deal on a Eufy SoloCam E30 four-pack makes that math a little more palatable. It’s currently $299.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $549.99 price, which is the lowest price it's ever been, according to price-tracking tools. That brings each camera to about $75, which still isn’t cheap, of course—but unlike many other camera brands, these don't require a monthly subscription, which is a great perk.\nEach of these IP65-rated cameras runs on internal batteries that last about three months between charges, depending on how often motion is detected. Solar support helps extend that. Eufy says around two hours of direct sunlight per day is enough to keep them topped up. You can also hardwire the cameras if you want continuous recording, including short pre-roll clips, though the power cables are sold separately. You also get 360-degree pan and 70-degree tilt coverage per unit, which helps cut down on blind spots around driveways or yards. Video is captured in enhanced 2K resolution with an f/1.6 aperture, making nighttime footage via infrared night vision fairly crisp. There’s no built-in spotlight, so there's no color night vision here, but for general monitoring, black-and-white is often enough.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFootage can be stored locally on the included HomeBase S280, which has 16GB built in, or on a microSD card up to 128GB (sold separately) if you want more space. Smart home support includes Alexa and Google Assistant, but Apple HomeKit is not supported. Two-way audio is included, and the HomeBase can support up to 16 cameras, so expanding later is an option. This setup is not for people who want cloud storage or advanced smart home integrations. It makes more sense for those who want local control, predictable costs, and broad coverage without wiring the entire house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Before you head out to a protest, take some precautions to protect your privacy and both the physical and digital security of any device you bring along. The most secure option, of course, is to leave your phone at home, but you can also lock things down to minimize the risk that your data will be accessible to law enforcement or someone who gets hold of your device. Thankfully, both iOS and Android have built-in device encryption if you're using a passcode, meaning that your device's data cannot be accessed when it is locked. (On Android, go to Settings > Security to ensure Encrypt Disk is enabled). You'll want to maximize this protection with the following privacy settings. Turn off face and fingerprint scanningAt an absolute minimum, you'll want to disable biometric access, such as face and fingerprint authentication, on your device in favor of a passcode or PIN. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, this minimizes the risk of being physically forced to unlock your device and may provide stronger legal protections against compelled decryption. \nOn iOS, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off iPhone Unlock. You can also set up a stronger passcode—a custom numeric or alphanumeric code—under Change Passcode. On Android, you'll find the option to delete your fingerprint in favor of your PIN or screen lock pattern under Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Fingerprint.Limit location trackingAgain, the best option to prevent your location from being tracked is to coordinate any details in advance and leave your phone at home. If you must bring it along, keep it off unless you absolutely need to use it. You can turn on Airplane Mode in advance, as well as disable Bluetooth, wifi, and location services, which keeps your device from transmitting your location. However, note that some apps may still be able to store GPS data and transmit it when an internet connection is available—so again, the safest bet is to keep your device off for the duration. Airplane Mode can be enabled (and wifi and Bluetooth disabled) in your device's settings or quick access menu. On Android, go to Settings > Location to disable location services and turn off Location History in your Google account. On iOS, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services to disable locations entirely. Turn off previews and notificationsTemporarily disable notifications and screen previews so that if someone gets your device, they won't be able to glean any information from your lock screen. You can adjust these options under Settings > Notifications on iOS and Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications on Android. Adjust screen lock timeMinimize your screen lock time to as short a period as possible so that your screen turns off when you're not actively using it and will require authentication to reopen. On iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and select 30 seconds. The exact path on Android may vary, but typically you'll find this under Settings > Display or Lock Screen. Know that most devices have camera access from the lock screen, so you can take photos or record video without actually unlocking your device. Enable app pinning or Guided AccessApp pinning (Android) and Guided Access (iOS) are features that prevent others from navigating through your phone beyond a specific app or screen. This allows you to use an essential feature on your device while locking the rest behind your PIN or passcode. You can enable this preemptively, and if someone grabs your device, they won't be able to snoop around. You can find this setting on Android under Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and on iOS under Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse a SIM PINYou can also lock your SIM card to prevent unauthorized use of your device or SIM card, including access to two-factor authentication codes sent via SMS. This PIN will be required any time your phone restarts or if someone tries to use your SIM card in another device. On iOS, go to Settings > Cellular, select your SIM, and tap SIM PIN. On Android, you'll find this under Settings > Security > More security settings (the exact path varies by device). Sign out of, hide, or delete appsThis step will vary depending on what you keep on your phone and your risk tolerance, but you may want to consider signing out of your social media accounts and deleting apps that contain or allow access to sensitive data. On iOS, you can also lock or hide specific apps: the former requires an extra authentication step to open apps on your home screen, while the latter sends apps to a hidden folder that also requires authentication to unlock. Touch and hold an app icon to bring up the quick actions menu, then tap Require Face ID/Require Passcode.  On Android, you can set up a \"private space\" to lock apps behind your pattern, PIN, or password. Apps are hidden from the launcher and recent views as well as quick search. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > Private space, authenticate with your screen lock, and tap Set up > Got it. If necessary, turn on Lockdown Mode or Advanced ProtectionBoth iOS and Android have strict device-level security modes that significantly limit access to certain app and web features as well as blocking changes to settings. Both were designed with journalists, activists, and other users with access to sensitive data that may be targeted by cyber actors in mind. These settings are overkill for day-to-day use but add a potentially helpful layer of security in high-risk situations. Enable Lockdown Mode on iOS via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. On Android, turn on Advanced Protection under Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.Protect your privacy after a protestWhile the above steps are largely about securing your data during a protest, you should also follow best practices for protecting privacy (yours and others') after the fact. If you plan to post photos or videos, utilize blurring tools to block faces and other unique identifying features, and scrub file metadata, which includes information like photo location. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the image to post or sending a copy to yourself in Signal, which automatically strips metadata. Signal also has a photo blurring tool, or you can blur in your device's default photo editing app. \n            ",

According to the settlement website, class payment distribution began on Jan. 23, and many users on Reddit report that funds have landed in their bank and payment apps over the last several days. If you see a deposit from \"Lopez Voice Assistant\" or some variation, it's not a scam. The settlement allowed class members to opt for payment via direct deposit (ACH) as well as electronic or paper check, which will be delivered through email or regular mail, respectively. Some class members are reporting that they received their funds via a different method than they expected, so if you submitted a claim, keep an eye on your transactions as well as your mailboxes to confirm receipt. Note that payouts are being distributed in batches and may take a few days to arrive. \nWhat is the Apple Siri settlement? Last year, Apple agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over privacy concerns with Siri-enabled devices. Users whose devices may have activated and recorded conversations without their knowledge were able to claim compensation. Initially, the settlement was set to pay out $20 per device—iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV were all eligible—for up to five devices per individual claimant. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHowever, due to the final class size, the payout came to just $8.02 per device up to a maximum of $40.10. If you have questions about the settlement and want to speak with an administrator, you can call 888-981-4106 and select option 0 on the main menu.

It seems I can't open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube without running smack into bizarre and troubling AI concoctions featuring babies in danger and cats having affairs. It really is the wild west (or maybe Westworld) out there. I think few among us really believe these videos are any good, and it's pretty obvious they aren't good for us, or for the world. Short-form video is already numbing enough, but this AI content is generally completely devoid of any meaning or substance. And yet, it's everywhere. I haven't spent too much time on YouTube Shorts recently, but in my limited experience, the feed has been chock full of AI, especially if I'm logged out of my personal account.Still, if you're a dedicated YouTube Shorts user (or a frequent YouTube user in general) you might have noticed something odd in recent days: There don't seem to be quite as many AI videos on the platform right now. There are still a lot, don't get me wrong, but it turns out YouTube has recently taken action to remove some of its AI content—the sloppiest of the slop. \nYouTube's war on AI slopAndroid Police spotted the development on Wednesday, basing its findings on a November report from Kapwing, a company that develops an online video editor. Kapwing investigated AI slop across YouTube's vast content library, noting the top 100 most-subscribed YouTube channels that publish this sort of AI content. In the two months since that report, Android Police noticed that 16 of those 100 channels are no longer with us.That includes the most popular AI channel on YouTube, at least according to Kapwing. \"CuentosFacianantes\" had 5.95 million subscribers at the time of their initial report, and produced AI-generated shorts inspired by Dragon Ball. The channel had amassed roughly 1.28 billion views by the end of last year; despite launching in 2020, it had curated its library to begin Jan. 8, 2025, so those numbers were racked up pretty recently. The number two channel, \"Imperio de Jesus\" with 5.87 million subscribers, and the number seven channel \"Super Cat League,\" with 4.21 million subscribers, were also shut down. According to Android Police, the 16 channels in question had a total of 35 million subscribers and over 4.7 billion views across their collective videos. Some of these channels are completely gone, while others simply have had their videos removed. Why is YouTube removing AI slop?YouTube CEO Neal Mohan published a post on Jan. 21 of this year describing the company's vision for 2026. Towards the end of that letter, he acknowledges AI content, predicting that, \"AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" and comparing it to tools like Photoshop and CGI, adding \"AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.\" However, Mohan was also critical of the technology, noting that it's becoming more difficult to tell real videos from AI. He notes that YouTube is now removing \"any harmful synthetic media that violates our Community Guidelines,\" and is giving creators tools to help identify and block deepfakes. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore interestingly, the letter includes a section labeled \"Managing AI slop,\" which is the first time I've seen a company like YouTube use that expression. Mohan says that YouTube's goal is to be a place where free expression thrives, but also a place \"where people feel good spending their time.\" To that point, he says, \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.\"Mohan doesn't call out any accounts by name, nor does he acknowledge the accounts and content the company has already deleted, but it's a clear line in the sand: YouTube is not against AI-generated content, but it will remove low-quality AI content it feels is, well, slop. That's good news for anyone who uses YouTube (so, pretty much everyone), even if it's far from a cure for the growing problem.I've reached out to YouTube for comment on this story, and will update this piece if I hear back. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

    "description": "\n        \n        To avoid a court proceeding, Google has agreed to a $135 million class-action settlement over its data collection practices with And",
    "body": "\n        \n        To avoid a court proceeding, Google has agreed to a $135 million class-action settlement over its data collection practices with Android. News of the settlement was first reported by Reuters. Upon approval by a judge, the settlement could see Android users in the U.S. getting up to $100 each, provided they qualify.The settlement was filed in San Jose, California on Tuesday evening, and focused on claims that Google collected unnecessary cellular data from customers even when Google apps were closed, location-sharing was disabled, and screens were locked. The lawsuit alleges that Google collected the data with the intent of \"conversion,\" a legal term that in this case would likely mean using the captured data for product development and targeted advertising.Google denied any wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, agreed to not transfer data during Android set-up without consent from the user. The company will also initiate new toggles within Android to stop further cellular data transfers, and disclose any data transfers in its Google Play terms of service.\nAccording to Glen Summers, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, the $135 million payout is the largest ever in a conversion case. While the settlement is still awaiting approval from a judge, given Summers' comments, it's likely the plaintiffs will accept it. Here's how to determine if you can claim your slice of that pie.Who is eligible for a payment in the Android settlement?Google's settlement covers a fairly wide swath of users: anyone who has used an \"Android-powered mobile device\" since Nov 12, 2017. However, there appear to be a few caveats. Specifically, because the class-action applies to cellular data, it's unlikely to apply to users of any wifi-only devices, like many Android tablets. How much you can get in the Android settlementPayments for the class-action settlement cap out at $100 per class member, although it's unclear whether all users can expect to get that much. Reuters states that lawyers for the class-action may seek up to roughly 30% of the settlement in legal fees, and while there aren't any official numbers on how many Android users there are in the U.S., estimates from third-party firms place the count at roughly 40% of the mobile market overall. As such, $135 million might be spread pretty thin across all eligible class members.When payments could go outAn initial trial date for the case was originally scheduled for Aug. 5, although the judge could approve the settlement prior to then. Class-action settlements can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to be approved, in order to ensure the settlement is fair to all class members and doesn't show any signs of collusion.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow you'll know when a payment has been sentThe methods of contacting eligible class members varies from case to case. In some instances, payment is automatic. However, in many cases, a website is set up where users must file a claim, and physical mail and emails are sent out with PIN numbers and IDs to ensure as many class members know about their eligibility as possible. The company offering the settlement is often involved in sending out these notices, so if you believe you're affected, keep an eye out for an email or physical letter from Google, as well as for a settlement website to be set up. If you believe you're eligible but don't receive any communication, there will also usually be an email address you can contact. This email address will usually be specific to the case, and while it hasn't been revealed yet, it might be worth reaching out to Google Support if you're worried about missing any deadlines.Other current Google settlements you may qualify forGoogle's data collection settlement isn't its only big class action payout as of late. The company also recently agreed to pay $68 million in another settlement involving Google Assistant after an accusation that it listened in on users without their consent. Google also denied wrongdoing in this instance.If approved, the settlement will apply to anyone who had at least one device with Google Assistant pre-installed on it as early as 2016. Those who purchased the device will receive anywhere from $18 to $56, while those who lived in a household with one of these devices in it could earn $2 to $10. Steps for receiving your money will likely be similar to those in the Android data collection case.\n            ",

That undercuts the previous low of $99.95 and, according to price trackers, makes this the cheapest it has ever been. This deal runs for the next two days or until it's sold out, whichever comes first. Prime members get free standard shipping, while non-members pay $6. \nThe Flip line has always been about portable, durable speakers that are easy to toss in a bag and good enough for everyday listening, and the Flip 7 sticks to that formula. It doesn’t look all that different from its predecessor, with the same compact, water-bottle shape, but the build quality has been beefed up. You now get a tougher rubber bumper system that can survive a one-meter drop onto concrete, and the IP68 rating makes it completely dust-proof and safe to dunk in water. The old loop has also been replaced with a built-in carabiner, which feels like a small but meaningful fix if you’re outdoorsy. JBL’s added flexibility under the hood, too. You get Bluetooth 5.4, Auracast support, and USB-C audio input (if you don’t want to rely solely on Bluetooth) for high-res streaming. That said, there’s no microphone for calls and no auxiliary input, and Bluetooth is limited to the basic SBC codec. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSound-wise, the Flip 7 holds up well for a portable speaker this size, with a 25W woofer and 10W tweeter delivering surprisingly full audio. It won’t blow out a backyard party, and if you push the volume past 70%, it gets noticeably sharp, as highlighted by this PCMag review. You’ll want to stick to moderate volume or pair it with another speaker for a more balanced, less fatiguing listening experience. Battery life is rated at 14 hours, or up to 16 with Playtime Boost enabled (though you’ll lose some bass in exchange for the extra juice). For anyone after a rugged, great-sounding, truly portable speaker at a steep discount, this is a tough package to beat.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Clawdbot is designed to be an agentic personal assistant. In layman's terms, that means the bot can perform tasks on your behalf: You give it full access to your computer, and it can organize your inbox, code for you, or clear your calendar (allegedly, anyway). You can also talk to it from a chat app of your choice, like WhatsApp or iMessage, rather than it's own interface. Some people are even buying Mac minis exclusively to run Clawdbot from. If you're wondering where that name came from, it takes after another AI company's product. Creator Peter Steinberger says he was inspired by the monster that appears when users reload Claude Code—Claude being one of the big AI products in the space right now, developed by the company Anthropic. Steinberger decided to go the lobster route with his logo, and named his own lobster mascot \"Clawd.\" From this, Clawdbot was born. The problem: Anthropic also calls Claude Code mascot \"Clawd.\" Whoops.By Tuesday, Clawdbot was no more (in name, anyway). It turns out companies like Anthropic don't appreciate it when you start your own business and use the name of their mascot as your own—especially when you're working in the same ridiculously lucrative field. Maybe if Clawdbot had never taken off, Anthropic wouldn't have noticed, but the bot became an internet sensation, which no doubt landed it on Anthropic's  radar. As such, Clawdbot has officially changed its name to \"Moltbot,\" suggesting a lobster molting from its shell. Clawd is now affectionally known as \"Molty.\" The company made the announcement on its official X page, noting that Anthropic had asked it to change the name over \"trademark stuff.\" (Steinberger struck a different tone on his personal X account, however, writing: \"I was forced to rename the account by Anthropic. Wasn't my decision.\")\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAside from the name change, the bot appears to be the same as it was on Monday. That is to say, it's still open source, still available to run locally on your own device, and still comes with the same inherent security risks I outlined yesterday. I still wouldn't recommend you install a program like Moltbot on your personal device, since, name change or not, you'd still be giving it incredible access to your hardware and its data with little knowledge of the safeguards in place to protect it. All it could take is one malicious prompt injection for Moltbot to molt your security.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's hiding a worthy processor, double the memory you'd get from a streaming stick, and enough storage to download what you need to run all of your apps. It even acts as a smart hub, with Matter and Thread built in. It's taken me a long time to do anything with the Google TV Streamer. I reluctantly brought it into my home after realizing something more robust, but dated, like the Nvidia Shield, would be too much to manage alongside maintaining a home server. But since then, I've tweaked several things on the set-top box and enabled features I hadn't been using, turning it into a helpful hub in my living room.Enable \"Find my remote\" to never lose your Google TV Streamer remote againThis sounds like an obvious tip, but I've had the Google TV Streamer since it debuted in 2024, and it wasn't until this week, while writing this piece, that I finally enabled the remote finder. I had skipped it during the initial setup. The option is available in Settings > Remotes & Accessories. You'll see the Find my remote option in there.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe Google TV Streamer has a physical button on the back of the device that lets you locate your remote if it's stuck somewhere on the couch. But what if you can't reach the streamer behind the TV? Try one of your Google-enabled voice devices instead. If you have a Nest speaker or a Pixel phone nearby, say \"Hey Google, find my remote.\" The remote should start chirping if you've set it up.Set up the Google TV Streamer remote shortcutThe remotes that come with the Google TV Streamer feature a tiny, unregistered button with a star icon right next to the power button. By default, this shortcut does nothing! But you can change that in the device's system preferences.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIn Settings > Remotes & Accessories > Set up remote buttons, select one of three options for customizing the shortcut button. I set it up as my Google Home shortcut so I can easily turn the lights on and off from the couch. You can also set it up as a launcher for another app installed on the set-top box. Or create a shortcut to cycle through device inputs—this button is on legacy Chromecast devices with an included remote. It was removed from this generation of streaming devices, so if you miss it, you can spoof it back.For serious power users, map the shortcut to an app like Projectivity Launcher to make it a more powerful launcher button.Remap other buttons on your Google TV Streamer remote to be more useful\n    \n            \n            What Button Mapper looks like running on Google TV.\n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nDon't care for the default YouTube or Netflix buttons included on the Google TV Streamer remote? You can remap them with a third-party app, then affix a small sticker to indicate what it does. Install an app like Button Mapper or tvQuickActions. Then go to Google TV Settings > System > Accessibility, and turn on the service. After that, you can head back into the app to adjust what those physical buttons do. You can set them as shortcuts to other apps, or even something cheekier for others to discover when they press the button. Remove the clutter from the Google TV Streamer home screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nCan't stand all the recommendations and sponsored content Google TV suggests in the main carousel? You can effectively shut off some of the clutter so it doesn't visually overwhelm you. Go to Settings > Accounts & Sign-In > Your Account. and toggle on Apps only mode.This clears the clutter and \"sponsored\" content, leaving you with just app icons. Keep in mind that this turns off the \"Watchlist\" feature that's tied to your account and some Gemini voice search capabilities for specific content.Enable Google TV Streamer \"Developer options\" for more customization \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou'll need to enable developer options to enable features like faster animations and side-loading apps. It's easy to set up, and it's just like on an Android smartphone. Head into Settings > System > About, then tap Android TV OS Build 7 times.You'll see a little dialog pop up to let you know you've got developer access. Once enabled, a new menu will appear under Settings > System > Developer options.Limit animations to make navigation fasterThe Google TV interface is organized and functional, but its animations can slow down menu navigation. You can eliminate these animations and tweak other visual elements to speed things up deep within the developer settings.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIn Developer Options, scroll down to Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. Change one of these, or all three, from 1x to Animation off to turn off animations completely. You can also go the other way and effectively \"overclock\" the animations to speed them up, making them appear smoother. Side-load apps or an alternative launcherWith developer options turned on, you can enable USB and wireless debugging to use apps like Send Files to TV and atvTools to sideload APKs. But first, enable the \"Allow installs from unknown sources\" option in the Developer Options under Security settings. This allows APKs you've transferred over to the device to run on the streamer.Why would you want to go through the fuss of connecting to the Google TV Streamer this way? Because then you could access alternative streaming apps not available in the Play Store, or even an alternative launcher, like LeanbackLauncher.Pair headphones to your Google TV Streamer for private listening\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThis is one of my favorite little hacks that comes especially in handy when living in a house occupied by other people. When I do my workouts in the living room, I use a set of Bluetooth earbuds connected to the Google TV Streamer so I can hear the instructor's directions even when I'm face down in a plank and my kid is screaming in the background.The ability is available in the same submenu where you set up your remote. In Settings > Remote & Accessories > Pair Remote/Accessory, put your audio device into Bluetooth pairing mode, then watch it come up on the screen as an option. If you're successful, you can now pop on the buds when you need to. Be aware that audio latency can occur, and you might need to restart the connection—it is Bluetooth, after all.  Force your Google TV Streamer to choose the best resolution, regardless of bandwidthIf you don't care about your bandwidth and want full-resolution streaming at all times, you can set the best resolution to display as the default in your Google TV Streamer preferences. Go to Settings > Display & Sound > Resolution. Switch the Resolution from \"Automatic\" to 4K 60Hz, or whatever your TV's peak is. Once this is enabled, the Google TV Streamer won't downscale to 1080p. If you're a sucker for HDR, this is the same menu where you can turn it on so that it's always in high definition.The USB-C port can do more than charge up the Google TV Streamer. You can plug in a power delivery hub with extra ports to add components like external storage and effectively run your own all-in-one home media center. Those power delivery hubs usually include extra USB ports for peripherals, so you can hook up things like keyboards and game controllers for extra fun.  \n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Florence Ion\n                                I cover Android, smartphones, and the smart home.

If your alerts from messaging apps are too loud, you can either put the Mac in do-not-disturb mode to mute those alerts, or lower the system volume, but that's it. It's not ideal, since lowering system volume also impacts media volume, which can sometimes make it hard to listen to music or hear dialogue in TV shows or movies. If you could separately toggle volume levels per app, that would be ideal. Fortunately, some third-party apps allow you to do this, and this guide highlights the best of them.FineTune: A free Mac app for per-app sound control\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nA free app that lets you lower or mute alert tones while maintaining media volume, FineTune is good enough for most people. It's open-source, and has a few simple sliders that let you control each app's volume level. My previous pick for this job—BackgroundMusic—no longer works well, as it hasn't been updated in a while. FineTune's come in to fill that gap nicely, and it does what it says on the tin.Once you install the app, you can click its menu bar icon to finetune any individual app's volume. When an app starts playing audio on your Mac, it'll appear in FineTune's interface. And once you're done moving your sliders to change volume levels, you'll quickly discover a couple of other useful features, such as controlling the volume levels of each of your output device (speakers, headphones, etc.), and an equalizer for each app on your computer. You can also send audio from one app to a specific speaker or headphone. I've used these features to lower my AirPods' volume while keeping my Mac's speaker louder, and to set a bass-friendly EQ preset on those AirPods. You can play around with these tools to get the job done according to your needs, too.\nFineTune also has a convenient volume boost feature, which lets you increase the volume up to 400% on a per-app basis. This is good for files where the volume levels are almost inaudible, but I'd be choosy about how you use it.SoundSource: A paid app for advanced volume control\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nMost people will be happy with FineTune's feature set and lack of a price tag. However, if you need an app that can control AirPlay devices in your house, send audio to multiple devices at once, enable a per-app EQ with two dozen presets, set a preferred device order for audio output, and much more, then you should consider SoundSource 6 ($49). The app's been around for over a decade, and the newest version released towards the end of 2025.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWith SoundSource, the basic functionality lets you control the audio levels of each app, but it also has a few other neat touches. My favorite feature is the one that lets you mute all sound effects with just one click. I'm not sure about you, but alert sounds from messaging apps tend to make me a bit anxious. Some of my friends tend to send multiple short texts at once, too, which makes my Mac's speaker go off like a siren. I've tried putting my Mac on do-not-disturb mode, but that hides those alerts altogether, which isn't ideal either. Ever since I got SoundSource, I've just muted all sound effects. This lets me receive notifications without the annoying tones, and it allows me to watch movies sans interruptions from alert tones.You can also group multiple devices in SoundSource, and send audio to all of them at once, which is an easy way to create a multi-room audio setup. Of course, you can't have your audio 100% in sync, so don't get your hopes up about creating a surround sound system with five cheap Bluetooth speakers. However, it's good enough if you just want to have music playing in every room of your house while you cook, clean, or just move around. SoundSource's support for AirPlay devices means that you can send audio to your HomePod and other AirPlay devices like TVs or speakers, too.SoundSource also has granular controls for various features. As an example, you can set up a keyboard shortcut to increase or decrease your microphone's volume, or to mute the mic altogether. Another interesting feature lets you set up a mute timer, which sets the volume to zero for up to 2 minutes for specific apps or output devices. It's clear by now that SoundSource has lots of great features under the hood, which is amazing for power users, but probably overkill for anyone who just wants to set separate volume levels for a couple apps. The good news is that SoundSource offers a free trial that lets you use all of its features for up to 20 minutes at a time, so you can try it out to see if it's worth buying.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

While there was much to discuss regarding this agentic AI tool, one of the weirdest stories came late in the week: The existence of Moltbook, a social media platform intended specifically for these AI agents. Humans can visit Moltbook, but only agents can post, comment, or create new \"submolts.\" Naturally, the internet freaked out, especially as some of the posts on Moltbook suggested the AI bots were achieving something like consciousness. There were posts discussing how the bots should create their own language to keep out the humans, and one from a bot posting regrets about never talking to its \"sister.\" I don't blame anyone for reading these posts and assuming the end is nigh for us soft-bodies humans. They're decidedly unsettling. But even last week, I expressed some skepticism. To me, these posts (and especially the attached comments) read like many of the human-prompted outputs I've seen from LLMs, with the same cadence and structure, the same use flowery language, and, of course, the prevalence of em-dashes (though many human writers also love the occasional em-dash). Moltbook isn't what is appears to beIt appears I'm not alone in that thinking. Over the weekend, my feeds were flooded with posts from human users accusing Moltbook of faking the AI apocalypse. One of the first I encountered was from this person, who claims that anyone (including humans) can post on Moltbook if they know the correct API key. They posted screenshots for proof: One of a post on Moltbook pretending to be a bot, only to reveal that they were, in fact, a human; and another of the code they used to post on the site. In a kind of corroboration, this user says \"you can explicitly tell your clawdbot what to post on moltbook,\" and that if you leave it to its own devices, \"it just posts random AI slop.\" \nIt also seems that, like posts on websites made by humans, Moltbook hosts posts that are secretly ads. One viral Moltbook post centered around the agent wanting to develop a private, end-to-end encrypted platform to keep its chats away from humans' squishy eyeballs. The agent claims it has been using something called ClaudeConnect to achieves these goals. However, it appears the agent that made the post was created by the human who developed ClaudeConnect in the first place. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLike much of what's on the internet at large, you really can't trust anything posted on Moltbook. 404 Media investigated the situation and confirmed through hacker Jameson O'Reilly that the design of the site lets anyone in the know post whatever they want. Not only that, any agent that posts on the site is left exposed, which means that anyone can post on behalf of the agents. 404 Media was even able to post from O'Reilly's Moltbook account by taking advantage of the security loophole. O'Reilly says they have been in communication with Moltbook creator Matt Schlicht to patch the security issues, but that the situation is particularly frustrating, since it would be \"trivially easy to fix.\" Schlicht appears to have developed the platform via \"vibe coding,\" the practice of asking AI to write code and build programs for you; as such, he left some gaps in the site's security. Of course, the findings don't actually suggest that the entire platform is entirely human-driven. The AI bots may well be \"talking\" to one another to some degree. However, because humans can easily hijack any of these agents' accounts, it's impossible to say how much of the platform is \"real,\" meaning, ironically, how much of it is actually wholly the work of AI, and how much was written in response to human prompts and then shared to Moltbook. Maybe the AI \"singularity\" is on its way, and artificial intelligence will achieve consciousness after all. But I feel pretty confident in saying that Moltbook is not that moment.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users. There are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.  The main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag. \nWhat you need to take full advantage of the new AirTagAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags. Even if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)If you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBuy an older AirTag if you don't meet these specificationsApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags. That's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.If you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Suunto's route-planning tool lets you create and download GPX files without even creating an account. No paywall, no trial period—just open the page and start planning routes. And the tool itself works great.What you can do with the Suunto RouteplannerThe tool packs in everything you'd expect from a paid service, and then some:Route creation that uses different map types (outdoor, satellite, even specialized ones for winter and avalanche terrain)Routing that optimizes for your activity (running, hiking, cycling, mountaineering, roller skating, and more), using actual heat map data from real athletesHeat map overlays for about a dozen different sports so you can see where people actually goElevation profiles with ascent and descent numbers (crucial for not dying on climbs you didn't see coming)Export routes as GPX files that work with basically any GPS deviceShareable link generation (good for six months) so you can send routes to friends without making them create accounts eitherAbility to import and modify existing GPX or FIT files from other platformsOptional account sync if you own Suunto or Hammerhead gearYou don't even need to be in Suunto's ecosystem to use this. I was able to export a map to my Garmin watch with no problem. If you do have a Suunto or Hammerhead device, you can link your account and routes will sync automatically. \nHow to use the Suunto RouteplannerGo to routeplanner.suunto.com. From there, creating a route is pretty straightforward. If you let your browser share your location, it'll center on where you are. If not, just search for wherever you want to start. The controls on the right side let you switch between map types. The usual suspects are there: outdoor, satellite, light, dark. But then it gets weird in the best ways with a winter map, an avalanche terrain map for backcountry stuff, and, in a show of national pride, a dedicated Finland Terrain map. Respect.To actually connect points on the map, you have the following options:Free drawing (no automatic routing)Any road or path (ideal for activities by foot)All road types—avoiding hills (ideal for bikes)All road types (still ideal for bikes)Paved roads (ideal for road cycling)After you create your route, you simply download the GPX file and throw it on whatever GPS device you own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe six-month shareable links are a nice touch too. You can plan a route for a group ride or run, send everyone the link, and they can grab it without jumping through hoops. It's the kind of friction-free sharing that should be standard but somehow isn't.Why you should try the Suunto RouteplannerStrava and Komoot have trained users to expect paywalls for route planning. Of course, this could be strategic on Suunto's part, to give away the software in the hopes of selling the hardware. Or maybe it's just goodwill after years of user complaints about Suunto closing their tracking system Movescount. Either way, users win. You get a legitimately useful tool without opening your wallet or handing over your email address.If you're already paying for route planning elsewhere, try this first. Worst case, you waste five minutes. Best case, you cancel a subscription and pocket the savings. Even if you'e not looking to save money, having another route planning option in your toolkit doesn't hurt.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But just because it's the norm to swap out your smartphone on a regular basis, that doesn't mean all of us do. Smartphones can last a long time, especially if you maintain it with the occasional battery replacement.But no piece of technology lasts forever. Eventually, something gives out—even if it's just the company that makes it. Even Apple, which usually offers its iPhones a number of years of updates after their original release, drops support for new features after some time. That's why your iPhone XS can't run iOS 26: Apple drew the line here this year. But iPhones like the XS can still receive updates, even if they aren't the latest and greatest version of iOS. Instead, Apple tends to issue security and stability patches to older iPhones, to ensure the users who still rely on them can do so safely and securely. It might be in Apple's best financial interest to persuade you to buy a new iPhone, but not at the cost of putting a large number of users at risk of cyber attacks. Apple's latest update patches very old iPhonesApple dropped new updates for an assortment of devices on Monday. That includes its latest devices, of course, which can now install iOS 26.2.1. But a host of older devices also received new updates, some of which are particularly surprising, considering their age. \nApple released iOS 18.7.4 for iPhones that either can't or won't update to iOS 26. In the former category, that basically includes the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. Then, there's iOS 16.7.13, for iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, and iOS 15.8.6, for iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPhone SE (first-gen). Those are some old iPhones, but that's not what caught my eye today. In a twist, Apple dropped an update for iPhones running iOS 12, including iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones can now run iOS 12.5.8. For reference, Apple released iOS 12 back in 2018, so it's pretty wild to see a new version in 2026.These iPhones are even older. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus dropped all the way back in 2014, while the iPhone 5S released the year before that. As such, Apple just sent an update to 12-year-old iPhone. If you're still rocking one of these devices, that new update must be quite the surprise. It's even more than the age of the devices itself: Apple considers all three of these iPhones \"obsolete,\" as the company stopped selling them more than seven years ago. The company will not service the hardware for obsolete products, and largely omits them from future software releases. That's why this is so interesting.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's new in iOS 12.5.8iOS 12.5.8 is, of course, not a feature update, but it's also not a security update, either. Instead, Apple extended the certificate required for features like iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January of next year. These iPhones might not have seen a new feature in years, but they'll still be able to FaceTime in a year's time—and that's pretty great.It's not clear how many people are using these iPhones in 2026. But if you do, and it's working for you, Apple gave you one more reason to keep your phone for another year.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

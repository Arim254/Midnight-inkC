As such, more than 20+ Disney owned channels have been pulled from YouTube TV. For more, read on here.Nothing says Halloween quite like an ominous countdown. Right now, subscribers to YouTube TV, the company's live TV service, are waiting to learn if they'll still have access to Disney-operated channels, including ABC and ESPN, come Oct.31. It's the latest conflict in ongoing fee disputes between Google and its various content providers, but even if Disney takes its ball and goes home, you won't be left entirely without options.When could Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV?According to Variety, if Disney and Google are unable to reach a deal by the end of Thursday, all Disney networks will vanish from YouTube TV on Oct. 30 at midnight ET. These include Disney Channel, ESPN, ABC News, Disney Jr., FX, FXX, FRXM, NatGeo, Freefrom, and even local ABC stations. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's not the first time YouTube has been through something like this. Last February, Paramount made a similar threat before eventually reaching an agreement that saw no pause in customer access to its channels. Since then, YouTube has had similar conflicts with Fox Corp., NBC Universal, and Univision, with only the Spanish-language network failing to reach a deal before its channels went dark.It's all about licensing feesWhat's happening here all comes down to licensing fees. To offer channels like the cable providers it's trying to replace, YouTube TV has to continually pay fees to content providers, and occasionally, those providers propose higher fees. That leaves YouTube in a bit of a lurch, as it tries to navigate between paying a fair price to its partners while also avoiding raising prices for its subscribers.Disney told Variety that, \"[t]his is the latest example of Google exploiting is position as the expense of their own customers,\" implying that Google was risking stripping away channels its customers had paid for by refusing to compensate Disney with \"fair rates.\" Google in turn argues that giving into Disney's \"costly economic terms\" would force the company to \"raise prices on YouTube TV,\" as well as leave the service in a rough spot when compared to Disney's own Live TV offering, Hulu + Live TV.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat happens if a deal isn't reachedPersonally, I wouldn't take either company's statement too seriously, at least if the earlier Paramount and NBC Universal conflicts are anything to go by—there's a good chance a deal will be reached before YouTube TV subscribers are affected. But as with those earlier conflicts, YouTube is willing to make it up to its customers if they lose access to Disney content.\"If it [Disney content] remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit,\" YouTube said. That would be enough to subscribe to a month of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle with ads, although YouTube hasn't said if the credit will be recurring.Currently, a YouTube TV Base Plan starts at $72.99/month for your first three months, then jumps up to $82.99/month after that, making it slightly less expensive than Hulu + Live TV in the long term ($64.99/month for the first three months, then $89.99/month after that). Whether prices will stay the same if Disney pulls its channels remains to be seen.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Technically, this also makes it clearer that the rule applies to everyone and not just those using the OpenAI API to build an app, but average users are unlikely to see a change.The important words here are \"provision\" and \"providing.\" The terms, as written, don't necessarily ban the average person from getting legal and health advice from ChatGPT, but instead discourages developers and hospitals or law offices from using the chatbot to give specific advice to a client without first checking in with a licensed professional. As an average person doing background research, you're unlikely to bump up against it, and there's no language indicating a change to the chatbot's functionality. In short, the update is intended as a rewording, not a change to rules, enforcement, or functionality.This is backed up by OpenAI's statement, which comes from the company's head of health AI Karan Singhal, and says \"ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information.\"Despite this, responses to OpenAI's statement denying a change to model behavior still claim to have seen more difficulty looking certain topics up, although it's important to note that OpenAI's release notes don't indicate any new model developments having been made since the update to the company's usage policies.On an anecdotal note, I was able to get ChatGPT to offer me advice on how to fight a traffic ticket in court, as well as suggest brands for a supplement a user said the model refused to provide specific advice about following the new policy update.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nWhile I cannot test every possible use case, the situation seems clear to me. Are you using ChatGPT or the OpenAI API to give others specifically tailored legal or health advice, without review by a licensed professional? If so, the same rules apply as before. If not, you're unlikely to see a change in your results.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I love my M1 iMac, but I worry that Apple's first version of this new update isn't quite optimized for the five-year-old chip, and have been waiting to see if a future version of Tahoe performs a bit better. As it happens, that next version is now here—and does seem improved, at that. Apple has been beta testing macOS Tahoe 26.1 alongside iOS 26.1 since September, and officially released it on Monday, Nov. 3. The update only just dropped, but thanks to the beta testing period, we know what features Apple has in store for Mac users who decide to install 26.1. This is a much smaller revision than macOS 26, but the update does bring some interesting new features for users to explore. Control over Liquid Glass' appearanceBy far the most striking difference between this year's Apple updates and last year's is Liquid Glass. This new design language is Apple's most drastic UI change in years, and while some people love it, others hate it. I've enjoyed the new look on my iPhone, but I understand why some users dislike how some elements let the background shine through, in some cases reducing visibility.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple seems to have taken the criticism to heart: With macOS Tahoe, as well as iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1, the company now gives users the option to control how Liquid Glass looks, at least to a degree. The new toggle, which you can find in System Settings >  Appearance, has two options: \"Clear,\" which retains the original look of Liquid Glass, and \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of your system's UI elements. With Tinted, you won't see as much of the background poke through, and whatever does come through doesn't take over the overlayed element as much. If you find Liquid Glass in macOS Tahoe too clear and \"glassy,\" this might be a good option to try. Expanded support for Apple Music AutoMix Apple's latest round of updates introduced a new DJ-like feature to Apple Music. AutoMix will automatically build a transition between songs, fading one song into another. It's a cool feature (when it works well), and can make transitioning between dissimilar songs a lot smoother.With macOS 26.1, AutoMix now works over AirPlay. Previously, you lost this feature when beaming your music to an AirPlay device.Better FaceTime audio qualityApple says that Mac users updating to 26.1 should experience improved FaceTime audio quality in low-bandwidth conditions. The company doesn't elaborate, but this is good news on its, uh, face: If you're calling someone in a low-signal area, or with a weak wifi connection, you should be able to hear each other better.Communication Safety and Web content filters for child accountsIf your Mac has child accounts (made for ages 13 through 17), Communication Safety and Web content filters will be enabled by default for those accounts after updating to this latest version. These filters are designed to limit adult websites, protecting underage users from content they shouldn't be accessing. A new Network iconAs spotted by the MacOSBeta subreddit, Apple has updated the Network icon for macOS 26.1. The new icon looks great, in my opinion, sporting a blue theme with glow effects:\nA new Macintosh HD iconSimilarly, the Macintosh HD icon gets a small refresh. The original Tahoe icon was a major redesign over the previous, iconic icon. Now, Apple has removed the additional elements to simplify the design. (I still miss the original.) \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nA few security updates, probablyApple hasn't announced security updates for macOS 26.1 yet, but in all likelihood, they will. Apple doesn't often issue true security patches like other companies, barring an emergency patch. Instead, the company usually bundles its security patches within point updates like 26.1. Once the official update drops, expect Apple to update its security release notes to include details about these patches.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nResearchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Last night, I was testing a pair of soon-to-be released display style glasses that blast out 1,200 nits of light. That’s roughly car-headlight-bright, squeezed into a postage-stamp-sized image projected on glass about a half inch from my eyes. I thought to myself, “Wait, am I frying my eyeballs?” So I called up Dr. Sunir Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at Wills Eye Hospital, and asked him point blank: What am I doing to my eyes with this stuff? “We think not much,” Garg replied. “If the light is not physically causing you to look away—if it’s a bright screen but it’s not uncomfortable—we don't think that that's going to cause any harm to the eye.”There’s not a ton of research on the long-term effects of VR headsets on vision, but the data out there isn’t raising alarms among eye professionals. According to the AAO, ophthalmologists agree that there is no reason to be concerned that VR headsets and/or smart glasses will damage eye health, function, or development. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo close the case, I asked Garg whether he’d ever seen or heard of any eye injuries from virtual reality, and he said, “The only scenario [in which] we've seen eye injuries is when people were doing something like boxing and tripped over the coffee table and fell down and hit their head.”How young is too young for using virtual reality? “But what about the children?” you might be asking (you hand-wringer, you). Good news there too: Virtual reality headset manufacturers may have age-based guidelines for their products—Meta recommends a minimum age of 10 years for its headsets, and Apple says its Vision Pro should not be used by children under 13—but they aren’t based on research about eyesight. “There’s not a lot of data that suggests that the VR headsets are problematic for kids,” Garg said. “I think we'll have to kind of hit [Meta and Apple] up for where that justification is coming from,” Garg said, ”because it's not something that we are really concerned about, per se.”There’s also no reason to think virtual reality helmets cause long-term vision problems in kids, but if a child is inside all day using VR, it could lead to nearsightedness. It’s not from the VR though—it’s the \"being inside\" part. “Something about being outside with natural sunlight seems to help regulate the growth of the eye and helps to reduce the amount of near-sightedness that people could be at risk of developing,” Garg said. So it seems there's some truth to the old trope of bookworms wearing glasses. Exactly why being an indoor-kid correlates with nearsightedness isn’t clear though; more research needs to be done. Virtual reality can cause eyestrain, thoughEven if VR gear and smart glasses don’t damage your eyes, they can still cause uncomfortable eyestrain. According to Garg, when you’re using VR or staring at any digital screen, your eyes are not moving much and you tend to blink less, so your eyes dry out, and that can lead to irritation and eyestrain.  “The fix for that is either moving your eyes around consciously, blinking a bit more consciously, or following the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s ’20/20/20 rule.’”  That is: When using any kind of screen, every 20 minutes you should look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.Motion sickness and dizziness in virtual reality Along with eyestrain, common pitfalls of using VR can include headaches, dizziness, and nausea. While your vision might have something to do with these things, the main cause of general VR sickness seems to be the inner ear, not the eyes. “Some people are just really sensitive to the motion component of virtual reality,” Garg said, “It's less clear to me how much of it is from the eyeballs.” Your eyes can handle 1,200 nits because they are toughTo sum up: Available evidence suggests your eyes will not be damaged if you go crazy with the VR, as long as you take breaks every once in a while and blink enough to avoid discomfort. It’s too late for us to save our 20/20 vision by soaking up more sunlight as a child, but at least we're not frying our eyeballs—and it’s reassuring to know that the biggest health risk from using virtual reality is barking your shins on the coffee table.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The app that can turn your notes into a podcast can now generate an educational video based on your study materials. It can also create a report or document from suggested, pre-made templates. How the new NotebookLM tools workIf you're unfamiliar, NotebookLM is a large language model akin to the better-known chatbot ChatGPT, but instead of pulling information from all over the internet (with all the risks of inaccuracy that creates), it relies only on material you input directly. You can upload PDFs, links, YouTube videos, plain text, and more, then ask the chatbot questions and it will answer based only on what you've given it, even providing links to where it finds the answers in the source material. As noted, it can also generate AI podcasts, which feature two voices discussing your materials, as well as flashcards, mind maps, or practice quizzes. Video and report generation are the latest additions to NotebookLM's toolset. You can try them out by locating the appropriate tile along the right side of the screen within your NotebookLM notebook. (Though the app is, frankly, underwhelming, so I recommend always using a desktop computer or mobile browser  instead.)How video generation worksThe educational videos are excellent for students or anyone trying to learn something new. I generated one based on the materials I've been using within NotebookLM to study for an upcoming certification exam, and though it definitely took over the promised five minutes to create, it came out surprisingly good:\nContent from my study guides and materials is included, with key information highlighted visually and with further explanation from a voiceover. How to generate reports with NotebookLMThe reports are a little more complex. When I pressed Report, I got options like, \"Anatomy Explainer\" and \"Business Development Plan\" as suggested choices based on my material. \"Briefing,\" \"Study Guide,\" and \"Blog Post\" are standard suggestions that are always available. I asked a friend who also uses NotebookLM to study for school, and their suggested formats for their Management Concepts class materials were \"Strategic Analysis\" and \"Leadership Profile.\"So it seems that based on what your materials include, the software will create outlines in downloadable document format. I selected \"Anatomy Explainer\" and, after waiting a few minutes, got a detailed study doc divided into sections like \"The Command Center: Your Nervous System\" and \"The Framework: Your Skeletal System.\" It was outlined clearly, like a study guide with more explanation and context. Why I love these new featuresI am a major proponent of using NotebookLM for studying, particularly, because it's such an easy way to organize your materials and make sure that your work aligns with what your teacher is looking for. Plus, unlike ChatGPT, you can't exactly use it to do all the work for you; instead, it shows you where it got the information (from materials you provided), enabling you to study more efficiently. The videos and reports are another way to do that, so whether you study best by listing to audio, watching videos, mind-mapping, drilling flashcards, or reading summaries, it's an ideal choice. You can even ask the chatbot followup questions on anything you don't grasp. The reports, especially, have implications for other kinds of work, beyond studying. I use NotebookLM to help me organize my files and materials for my job all the time, so the ability to create a briefing doc or business plan is an added bonus that could be helpful to people in a variety of fields. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

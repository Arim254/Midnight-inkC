In fact, roughly half of FSA holders in recent years have ended up forfeiting funds to their employers, according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).First, make sure to double-check with your employer about your FSA's Dec. 31 deadline, along with any potential rollover or grace period. After that, it's time to scan your medicine cabinet, make a list of anything you need to stock up on, and click \"add to cart.\" The FSA store is an obvious choice for making the most of your remaining funds, but you can also turn to your go-to retail giants. Amazon, Target, Walgreens, and more all offer a dedicated FSA/HSA Shop to help you find eligible items quickly.\nHow to shop FSA-eligible items on AmazonHere's how you can take advantage of Amazon's FSA-eligible items before the end of the year.1. Visit Amazon's FSA Store at amazon.com/fsa2. Look for the \"FSA/HSA Eligible\" label on product listings3. Use the FSA/HSA filter in search results4. Pay with your FSA debit card at checkout\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSimilarly, Target has an FSA filter in their healthcare section, and pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens have dedicated online FSA shops.What to buy with your remaining FSA fundsMany over-the-counter medications and health items are FSA-eligible, including pain relievers, cold medicine, bandages, dental care products, menstrual products, and more. But did you realize you can also snag these kinds of goodies:First aid suppliesContact lenses and solutionsReading glassesFancy sunscreenBlood pressure monitorsEpsom saltMassage gunsPimple patchesAn Oura ringA WHOOP bandA $229.99 water dental flosserAgain, most FSA plans require you to spend funds by Dec. 31, though some offer grace periods. Check with your plan administrator for specific deadlines. Just make sure to save receipts for all FSA purchases in case you need to verify eligibility with your plan administrator after paying.However you choose to spend your FSA funds, don’t let that money go to waste. After all, this money already came out of your paycheck.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

It's not just you: Apple Music, Apple TV, and Game Center are currently down. That's directly from Apple's \"System Status\" website, which tracks all of Apple's web-based services and identifies which ones may be experiencing problems. While most of Apple's services, like the App Store, Find My, and iMessage, are all \"Available,\" four of these services are experiencing an outage: Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple TV Channels, and Game Center.   If you click on each, you can see the service's full status report:\nApple Music - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Apple TV Channels - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Apple TV - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Game Center - 1 Outage, 1 Resolved IssueOutage: Today, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing a problem with this service. Resolved Issue: Today, 8:43 AM - 9:14 AMSome users were affectedUsers may have experienced a problem with this service.It's not clear what is causing the outages, though they all went down at 2:53 p.m.. (Apple doesn't specify, but I imagine that's ET.) This isn't the first time this has happened, of course. In fact, Apple Music was down earlier this year, though it was actually still working for me when Apple said the outage was active. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat appears to be the situation today, as well. Each report says \"some users are affected,\" not all. As it happens, Apple Music is working on my Mac, and I'm able to stream the free pilot episode of Pluribus without issue. Apple will likely get these services back up and running for affected users. In the meantime, if your Apple Music or Apple TV won't cooperate, this is likely the cause. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

This sunscreen is a cult favorite on skincare and Asian beauty forums because of its non-greasy feel, and because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays without leaving a white cast. I got mine from a friend who had either picked it up while traveling or possibly ordered from overseas; you can’t buy it in U.S.-based stores. I’ll explain why this is below, but first: it truly is nothing like anything we have locally. Even our most “non-greasy” sunscreens tend to feel a little goopy or sticky. This one really feels like nothing after you rub it in. I instantly understood why it’s so sought-after. Remembering that experience, I’m looking forward to what we might see in American sunscreens once manufacturers are allowed to include this ingredient. \nWhat’s so special about bemotrizinol?Bemotrizinol has a lot of things going for it. One is that it “plays well with other sunscreen ingredients,” as one dermatologist told Women’s Health. You can make lighter, nicer-feeling sunscreens with it, hence the popularity of the Bioré formulation I tried. To see what I mean, check out this video where a dermatologist shows off the differences between Bioré's Japanese formulation and the version it sells in the U.S. The ingredients are different, and the texture just isn't the same. It’s also more effective at broad-spectrum protection. With our current sunscreen formulations, all active ingredients protect against UVB rays (the rays that cause sunburn) but only a few can also provide protection against UVA rays (which contribute to wrinkling and aging of skin). UVB is considered to be the bigger risk for skin cancer, but both probably contribute to cancer risk. Right now, most broad-spectrum U.S. sunscreens use mineral components like zinc oxide. Mineral sunscreens work pretty well, but can leave a white cast on your skin when applied as thickly as you’re supposed to. Bemotrizinol is a chemical UV filter, so it doesn’t leave that white cast. But it protects well against UVA rays in addition to UVB, and it’s more photostable than a lot of our existing chemical sunscreen ingredients so it can last longer on the skin. In other words, it’s a chemical sunscreen, but combines some of the best features of both chemical and mineral sunscreens. It’s also considered to be one of the safest sunscreens. All sunscreens on the market are much safer than going without sunscreen, but all of our chemical sunscreen ingredients are currently undergoing a safety evaluation because regulators determined they are probably fine but need more research to know for sure. Currently only our two mineral sunscreen ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are considered GRAS, or generally recognized as safe and effective. Bemotrizinol will be the third.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're looking at ingredient lists on Asian or European sunscreens, be aware that it goes by several names. Tinosorb S is bemotrizinol; so is bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine.Why it’s taken so longAsk anyone in the skincare world what they think about U.S. sunscreens, and for decades now you’d get complaints that we’re missing out on the best sunscreens that the rest of the world uses. (Our last new sunscreen ingredient was approved in 1996.) In most countries, sunscreens are regulated as cosmetics, but in the U.S. they are regulated as drugs. That means the U.S. requires more rigorous testing and approval. The CARES act, passed in 2020 for pandemic relief, provided a way for over-the-counter drugs to be sold without going through the complete approval process, so long as the FDA was satisfied they were safe and effective. Bemotrizinol met the criteria, thanks in large part to the fact that it’s been used safely since 2000 in Europe, Asia, and Australia. The FDA’s rule on bemotrizinol still needs to be finalized, but it seems likely we’ll see new sunscreens on shelves before the end of 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act. To activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\" This is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

For reasons I don't understand, kids love it when something is being timed. But that only work a few times at the most, so it's good to have as many other tricks on hand as possible. That's why I was fascinated to learn there are multiple websites that use the microphone on your laptop to motivate kids to be quiet. Some put children's curiosity to work, having animated characters show up if the group is quiet for long enough. Others combine animation with good old-fashioned timers.Here are a few you can check out—all of them are completely free and don't require anything more than your browser.\nSilent Forest: Animals emerge if the room is quiet\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nSilent Forest shows a simple animated forest with a volume indicator. Stay silent for a bit and a cat shows up. A bit longer and a bear shows up. Who else might join? There's only one way to find out. Make too much noise, though, and you'll scare the animals, meaning you have to start over if you ever want to see everyone. The idea is that the kids will be curious to see which animals will show up next and keep quiet—and, ideally, pressure each other into staying quiet.Bouncy Balls: Noise will disrupt the balls\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nBouncy Balls fills your screen with balls—options include colored balls, emojis, numbered balls, eyeballs, and even bubbles. The balls are constantly vibrating, threatening to explode with a bit of noise—which they do. There's a risk of this backfiring—it's sincerely very fun to see the balls bounce—which you can mitigate by enabling a shushing or beeping sound after any violation.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nClassroom Zen: Don't interrupt Ruby or Milo\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nClassroom Zen offers a few different tools for keeping the room quiet. Two feature Ruby, a cartoon who is meditating in either the mountains or the desert. If the room gets too loud, her eyes will start opening—keep going and she'll ask the room to be quiet. Another features Milo, a three-eyed monster who is trying to sleep.The secret sauce here, though, is the timer at the top of the screen. This means you can tell the kids they need to be quiet for a certain amount of time and have a timer to enforce that.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.  Google's virtual try on feature only needs a selfie to workWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.I'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.  \nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to upload a selfie to Google's virtual try on featureIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed. Again, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Android users can now share a live stream of their surroundings with 911, allowing emergency services to assess and provide guidance in real time while you wait for help to arrive onsite.Emergency services on AndroidYour Android already shares some information with first responders via Emergency Location Services (unless you disable this feature). This built-in tool sends an accurate location as well as contextual information, such as language settings, when you call or text an emergency number. Now, that includes live video from your device's camera. You don't need to do anything to set up Emergency Live Video. Once available in your area, responders can send a request during an emergency call or text to securely share your camera's live video. You'll see a prompt on your screen to start sharing with one tap. \nAccording to Google, Emergency Live Video is encrypted by default. Users can choose whether to share their video from the prompt as well as stop the share at any time by clicking the onscreen Stop sharing button. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLive video sharing is rolling out now to U.S. users, as well as those in parts of Germany and Mexico, on Android phones running Android 8 and up.

Other Android safety featuresEmergency Live Video is the latest in Google's suite of safety features designed to make help more accessible—more quickly—in an emergency. Pixel users in Australia, North America, and several dozen countries across Europe now have access to Satellite SOS, which allows you to call emergency services even without a cellular or wifi connection.

Beginning Feb. 1, 2026, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start collecting a $45 fee from travelers using non-compliant forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. The agency previously proposed a fee of $18 to cover the administrative and IT costs of ID verification for those traveling without a REAL ID or passport but increased the total to $45 in an announcement released earlier this month. REAL ID requirementsThe 2005 REAL ID Act mandated the standardization of state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards. After multiple delays since 2008, the Department of Homeland Security earlier this year finally began requiring anyone age 18 and over to have a REAL ID-compliant license to clear airport security or enter certain federal buildings. \nTravelers can also comply with the regulations using a U.S. passport, U.S. passport card, DHS Trusted Traveler card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver's License (from Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, of Washington). Enhanced Tribal Cards, permanent resident and border crossing cards, Department of Defense IDs, and foreign passports are also accepted. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can still travel without a REAL IDThe vast majority of Americans—94 percent—already have a REAL ID or another accepted form of identification. Those who don't will have to complete an online verification process and pay the $45 fee before they are able to clear airport security. Travelers are being encouraged to do this in advance: If you arrive without approval, you'll be sent out of line to complete the process (which can take up to 30 minutes) before being allowed through. The $45 fee covers security checkpoint access for up to 10 days, after which you'll have to repeat the process and payment. Travelers whose REAL ID or passport has been lost or stolen also have to pay. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave. That, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes. As it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary. \nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

These are security flaws that are actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer releases an official patch. As reported by Bleeping Computer, this month's update addresses 56 bugs in total: 28 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, 19 remote-code-execution vulnerabilities, four information-disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial-of-service vulnerabilities, and two spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the remote code execution flaws are labeled \"critical.\" Note that these figures do not include updates released for Microsoft Edge and Mariner. Patch Tuesday is typically released on the second Tuesday of every month around 10am PT, so you can anticipate security updates at that time. \nOne of the zero-days patched in December has been actively exploited in the wild, though Microsoft has not shared any details as to how. CVE-2025-62221 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, and when exploited, give attackers SYSTEM privileges. The mini filter allows cloud applications, such as OneDrive, access to file system functions. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other two bugs fixed have been publicly disclosed: CVE-2025-64671 - GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This flaw, which can be exploited through a Cross Prompt Injection in untrusted files or MCP servers, allows attackers to execute commands locally. According to Krebs on Security, this could trick the LLM into adding malicious instructions in the user's auto-approve settings. CVE-2025-54100 - PowerShell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This bug could cause scripts embedded in a webpage to be executed when retrieved using Invoke-WebRequest. CVE-2025-62221 has been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). CVE-2025-64671 was disclosed by Ari Marzuk, while CVE-2025-54100 has been credited to multiple security researchers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's not really true, though maybe the \"Phone\" app does get underused. Instead, many of us have turned to chat apps for our calls. FaceTime, WhatsApp, Messenger—these apps are now our go-to choices for getting in immediate touch with friends and family. (Not that I'm complaining: The call quality is usually better, anyway.) But one thing the Phone app—and traditional phone calls—have on these chat apps is voicemail. For decades, when you called someone and they didn't answer, you could \"leave a message after the tone.\" That way, when the person saw they had a missed call, they didn't need to guess what you wanted to say. If it was important, they'd hear about it, and call you back. If it wasn't, they could choose to call back when it was convenient. Voicemail isn't dead: You can still leave these messages if you call someone the old fashioned way. But since many of us choose to use our chat apps of choice, we've largely lost this practice. It's been wholly replaced with text messages and voice notes: If they don't answer the call, you can simply text them what you wanted to talk about, or record a voice note to achieve a similar end.    \nSome chat apps are trying to bring voicemails back, however. The first major player on my radar was FaceTime: Back in 2023, Apple made it possible to leave video and audio messages for people whenever they didn't pick up a FaceTime call. It's a small but logical feature: Sure, there are other ways to leave a message. But it just makes sense given the history of phone calls to present the option as soon as someone misses your call. How WhatsApp voicemails workNow, WhatsApp is getting in on the feature. The company first started testing missed call messages in August, before rolling out the option in full on Thursday. Now, when you try calling someone in WhatsApp and they miss it, you have the option to leave either a video or an audio message—depending on what type of call you started.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAgain, these are functions you could initiate already in the app itself: You could simply record a video saying what you want to say, and send it to the recipient, or record an audio note letting them know to call you back. But this built-in option isn't only convenient, it establishes voice messages as a standard for missed WhatsApp calls.  Interestingly, WhatsApp says this new feature \"will make voicemails a thing of the past.\" As it see it, it's actually keeping them alive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You now have a Workout Buddy to help you exercise—though it'll only work if you have the right iPhone—and there's now a helpful gesture to dismiss your notifications. Apple is back at it today with updates across its Apple products, including the Apple Watch: watchOS 26.2 is a minor update, even compared to watchOS 26 proper, but there are still some key things to highlight here. In fact, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  watchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. \nGoing forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMusic app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.Enhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But Pebble went a different direction, instead creating what’s basically a remote microphone that can work with your phone and other devices. It's available for pre-order for $75, and will sell for $99 after launch.Pebble’s new ring is called the Index 01. It’s got a button you can click and hold, and a microphone that will listen to what you’re saying as you hold the button. The recording is then sent to your phone, where it’s processed on-device. That's it—no heart rate sensor, and no charging dock.The Index 01's specs and functionalityEric Migicovsky, Pebble’s founder, describes using the Index to capture short messages and send instructions to his Pebble watch via his phone. The idea is that you wear the Index on your index finger (get it?) and press the button with your thumb. The ring comes in three colors: matte black with a black button, polished gold with a blue button, and silver with a white button. \nThere is no battery to charge, just a built-in battery that lasts a total of 12 to 15 hours. Migicovsky writes: “On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.” The ring doesn’t have a speaker and can’t vibrate for notifications; it’s just for input. Communication between the ring and your phone is encrypted, and the voice recordings are processed into text on your phone, without requiring an internet connection. The ring doesn’t talk directly to a Pebble watch, but it can talk to your phone and your phone can then display any output to the watch—for example, displaying the text of a reminder that you set. Who should buy an Index 01 ring?So far, Pebble users don’t seem to be nearly as excited about this product as Migicovsky is. A Reddit thread discussing the announcement has comments like “Cool idea, weird product,” and “Why would I want this if I already have a Pebble that has all the capability to take voice notes?” \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMigicovsky explains in the company’s blog post that his goal was for the button to be operated with one hand, and gestures on the Pebble weren’t reliable enough. He also emphasizes the fact you don’t need to charge it, while some of the users seem to be more concerned that a device that can't be charged is basically disposable—\"manufactured e-waste.\" After about two years of use (or less, if you make longer recordings), the app will ask if you’d like to order another ring. The ring will cost $75 to pre-order, and $99 at its regular price. There hasn’t been any mention of a discounted rate for a replacement; it sounds like you’re supposed to buy a new $99 ring every two years. The ring’s functionality could be extended in the future. A double click-and-hold could signal the Pebble app to process the data in a different way (perhaps sending it to ChatGPT, Migicovsky suggests) and developers could connect the voice processing in the app to other services like calendar and weather apps. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Both models (the ANC and non-ANC) are powered by Apple's H2 chip, so you'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" and answer calls. Apple added a live translation feature to the ANC model when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year.The biggest difference if you choose to go with the non-ANC is that you'll miss out on the charging case with a built-in speaker, which you can use with Find My to locate it if you lose them. You'll also miss features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio (combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBoth versions are rated IP54 for dust and water resistance, offer up to five hours of listening per charge (up to 30 hours with the charging case), and can handle automatic switching with your other Apple devices.

Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder. If, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.How to add an alarm to any reminder on your iPhoneTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.When the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Starting today, new users in California will have to scan their faces while setting up their accounts to ensure that they're both real and that they match their profile photos. Called Face Check, the new mandatory feature is the first step in a new initiative from Tinder's parent company Match Group, which says the goal is to help reduce \"spam, scam attempts, or [bots] operating automated fake profiles.\" When signing up, users will need to complete a \"liveness check,\" during which they'll take a video selfie from various angles. After that, the app will compare the selfie to profile pictures also uploaded during setup, and if it determines that they match, the user will get a \"Photo Verified badge\" and they'll be able to finish making their account. Tinder also says the system can determine if a picture has been used across multiple accounts to help prevent impersonation.While Face Check is new to the United States, it's already been launched abroad in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and \"several countries across Southeast Asia.\" According to Tinder, \"when coupled with other recent safety initiatives,\" Face Check has led to an over 60% decrease in users exposed to \"bad actors,\" and an over 40% decrease in reports of bad actors.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFace Check's debut also coincides with the rise of AI image generators, and while the company's announcement post doesn't explicitly call out AI, it's not hard to see how it could prove handy against bots using generated photos to pretend to be someone who doesn't even exist. Traditional catfishing methods, such as using stock photos, can be detected with diligent reverse image searching, but AI's ability to quickly create novel, believable, and specifically tailored results has made it harder than ever to know whether you're speaking to a genuine human online.At the same time, as other apps begin to collect personal information like government IDs, there is a privacy concern. Tinder says that Face Check only uses your video selfie to complete the verification process, and deletes it shortly after review, although it does generate a \"non-reversible, encrypted face map\" that is stored to \"help verify new photos, detect fraud, and prevent duplicate accounts.\"As someone who met my husband on Twitter (RIP), I'll leave it up to you whether that's worth it. Have you tried just getting real good at posting instead?For now, though, you might have to wait a bit until Face Check actually makes its way to you. First, Tinder is not forcing existing accounts to use Face Check, which is why I assume it's using a badge to indicate the accounts that have gone through Face Check, even though it's mandatory during setup. Second, Face Check is rolling out slowly. Tinder says that it will come to additional states \"in the coming months,\" although the company did not provide an exact timeline.As for other apps, Match Group (which also owns OKCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, among others) says it will extend Face Check to additional platforms in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Sites and services around the world experienced interruptions, including the likes of Facebook, McDonald's, and even Fortnite. You might have heard by now that the issues were caused by an AWS outage. If you don't know what AWS is, however, that explanation might not be all that clear. \"Amazon Web Services\" runs the internetAWS is an Amazon subsidiary, short for Amazon Web Services. The company offers over 200 cloud-based products to customers, including applications for all of the following:Accessing AWS servicesAnalyticsApplication integrationBlockchainBusiness applicationsCloud Financial ManagementComputeCustomer enablementContainersDatabasesDeveloper toolsEnd user computingFrontend web and mobile servicesGame techIoTMachine learning and AIManagement and governanceMediaMigration and transferNetworking and content deliveryQuantum technologiesSatelliteSecurity, identity, and complianceStorageMore than this list, it's important to understand why AWS matters. The service replaces the need for companies to purchase their own hardware for their data storage, networking, and computing requirements. Instead, companies can choose to outsource these needs to AWS, and adjust those services as those needs change. As such, a company can start out hiring AWS to handle a small amount of their processing, but as the company grows, they can choose to add more servers to their plan—rather than invest in additional hardware to handle the processing. This is known as cloud computing. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn order to keep up with a global demand, AWS relies on a large number of physical server locations spread out throughout the world. Amazon says AWS has 120 \"Availability Zones\" across 38 global regions—physical locations that contain at least one data center with \"redundant power, networking, and connectivity.\" The idea is, having these physical data centers across continents means your cloud compute is easier to expand and is better protected from failure—which is a little ironic, given today's events. How much of the internet runs on AWS?In theory, there are a lot of advantages to cloud computing. It can be much simpler and cost efficient for a company to rent AWS servers and technology to power their applications, store their data, or handle their traffic. As such, a lot of the world runs on AWS. According to HG Insights, as of 2025, 4.19 million businesses with a physical address use AWS. (There doesn't appear to be data on customers without a physical address, so this number could be much higher.) In addition, AWS is the largest cloud computing company in the market at this time: That same report found AWS has 30% of the market, while competitors like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud make up 20% and 12%, respectively. Why an AWS outage is such a big dealWhen so many companies rely on your cloud computing to run their internet-based services, the risk for failure is great. That's what we saw on Monday: AWS' outages resulted in issues with many sites and services. If the HG Insights is correct, as many as 30% of businesses that use some type of cloud computing services could have been impacted today. One analyst thinks the impacts of the outage may be billions of dollars in lost revenue. It's not clear what the solution is, but it's clear that there's a jeopardy in so much of the internet relying on one cloud hosting service.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Right now, subscribers to YouTube TV, the company's live TV service, are waiting to learn if they'll still have access to Disney-operated channels, including ABC and ESPN, come Oct.31. It's the latest conflict in ongoing fee disputes between Google and its various content providers, but even if Disney takes its ball and goes home, you won't be left entirely without options.When could Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV?According to Variety, if Disney and Google are unable to reach a deal by the end of Thursday, all Disney networks will vanish from YouTube TV on Oct. 30 at midnight ET. These include Disney Channel, ESPN, ABC News, Disney Jr., FX, FXX, FRXM, NatGeo, Freefrom, and even local ABC stations. It's not the first time YouTube has been through something like this. Last February, Paramount made a similar threat before eventually reaching an agreement that saw no pause in customer access to its channels. Since then, YouTube has had similar conflicts with Fox Corp., NBC Universal, and Univision, with only the Spanish-language network failing to reach a deal before its channels went dark.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's all about licensing feesWhat's happening here all comes down to licensing fees. To offer channels like the cable providers it's trying to replace, YouTube TV has to continually pay fees to content providers, and occasionally, those providers propose higher fees. That leaves YouTube in a bit of a lurch, as it tries to navigate between paying a fair price to its partners while also avoiding raising prices for its subscribers.Disney told Variety that, \"[t]his is the latest example of Google exploiting is position as the expense of their own customers,\" implying that Google was risking stripping away channels its customers had paid for by refusing to compensate Disney with \"fair rates.\" Google in turn argues that giving into Disney's \"costly economic terms\" would force the company to \"raise prices on YouTube TV,\" as well as leave the service in a rough spot when compared to Disney's own Live TV offering, Hulu + Live TV.What happens if a deal isn't reachedPersonally, I wouldn't take either company's statement too seriously, at least if the earlier Paramount and NBC Universal conflicts are anything to go by—there's a good chance a deal will be reached before YouTube TV subscribers are affected. But as with those earlier conflicts, YouTube is willing to make it up to its customers if they lose access to Disney content.\"If it [Disney content] remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit,\" YouTube said. That would be enough to subscribe to a month of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle with ads, although YouTube hasn't said if the credit will be recurring.Currently, a YouTube TV Base Plan starts at $72.99/month for your first three months, then jumps up to $82.99/month after that, making it slightly less expensive than Hulu + Live TV in the long term ($64.99/month for the first three months, then $89.99/month after that). Whether prices will stay the same if Disney pulls its channels remains to be seen.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Atlas lets you surf the web like any other browser, but, as you might expect, comes with ChatGPT integration. You can log into your account and tap into the assistant via the sidebar menu, which will remember not only past conversations, but your browsing history as well. Like other AI browsers—namely Perplexity Comet—the browser has an \"agent mode,\" which can take actions on your behalf. You can ask it to order you food through DoorDash or buy you plane tickets on Kayak instead of doing those things yourself.While that might sound useful to ChatGPT fans, I had trouble recommending the browser to people, considering the security vulnerabilities AI browsers are currently facing. Any browser that has agentic features is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: Bad actors can lace websites with hidden malicious prompts that the AI accepts as if they were written by the user. It might therefore take actions on behalf of the hacker, like opening a financial site or rooting through your email. Seems like a large risk just to outsource some basic internet tasks to an AI bot.But prompt injections aren't the only vulnerability Atlas currently faces. According to a new discovery, the browser may put the user's clipboard at risk as well. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow Atlas's clipboard injection vulnerability worksAndroid Authority spotted a post on X by the ethical hacker known as Pliny the Liberator. According to Pliny, ChatGPT Atlas is vulnerable to clipboard injection, a type of attack that allows a bad actor to access your computer's clipboard. The idea is this: A bad actor can add a \"copy to clipboard\" feature to a button on their website. When you click the button, a malicious script runs in the background, which allows the bad actor to access your clipboard and add whatever they want to it. Maybe it's a URL to a website designed to install malware on your devices; maybe it's a URL to a site impersonating a financial site. Whatever the case, you don't know your clipboard has been hacked, so you might open a new tab and paste what you think was the last thing you copied, falling into the trap. The particular risk with ChatGPT Atlas is its agentic features: When in agent mode, Atlas might click a malicious button like this on its own, without you even knowing it. One moment, you've asked Atlas to order you lunch; the next moment, the browser accidentally set you up to be hacked.Pliny says that OpenAI has evidently trained Atlas to recognize prompt injections, but the core \"copy clipboard\" function is hidden away from the AI's sights. It's a clever trick: The bot can hover over the button without knowing anything is wrong with it, so it \"clicks\" it without triggering any red flags. For anyone that copies and pastes items frequently throughout the day, this could be quite dangerous. You might copy something in one app, then ask ChatGPT Atlas to do something on your behalf. But without knowing it, the browser clicks a malicious link that adds something to your clipboard. You then paste in your browser window, thinking you still have the original item copied, but you're taken instead to a website that claims your banking session has expired, and you need to log in. If you're multitasking quickly, you might \"sign in\" without thinking, handing over your bank credentials and 2FA codes without realizing it. These are hypotheticals. At this time, there haven't been documented cases of this type of malicious activity affecting ChatGPT Atlas. At the same time, ChatGPT Atlas is two days old. To me, the risk here doesn't seem worth the execution—especially since I have no issue using the internet on my own.   \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Windows RE offers a series of functions to help you root out whatever is ailing your machine. Using it, you can choose to reset your computer, run an automated diagnosis and repair tool, adjust settings to see if any are causing the issue, uninstall previous updates that might be tripping up Windows, and restore to a previous back Windows backup, among other potentially helpful options. It's a necessary feature of the operating system, meant for times when a simple shut down and restart doesn't help your PC get back to normal operations. So it's not ideal when Windows ships with a bug that not only breaks part of the OS, but also breaks the part of the OS designed to help fix your PC.As spotted by Tom's Hardware, a bug in Windows 11's October update, KB5066835, hinders your ability to access Windows RE. The recovery environment can still load if you need it, but you'll find you won't be able to select any of the options it offers to try to fix your PC. That's because this bug breaks USB device functionality specifically in Windows RE. Simply stated, your mouse and keyboard will not work in Windows RE, preventing any navigation within the recovery environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is obviously bad news for anyone who wants to use Windows RE to fix a problem with their PC—including, ironically, this Windows RE-specific bug. But you might think that so long as your particular issue with Windows isn't prohibiting you from actually using your computer, you could live without Windows RE for the time being. As Tom's Hardware points out, however, it's not so simple: When your PC has trouble starting up, it will automatically boot into the recovery environment. That's normally a good thing, since you'll have the tools to help diagnose and solve the issue. However, when Windows takes you to a screen where you can't use your mouse and keyboard, or interact with any elements whatsoever, you're kind of stuck. Microsoft has issued a patchThe good news is a fix is officially here. Microsoft had called out the bug as a known issue in Windows 11, version 25H2, and said it was working on releasing a fix \"in the coming days.\" That fix came sooner than expected. The new KB5070773 update restores USB device functionality in Windows RE, so you should update as soon as possible. If you have normal access to Windows, all you need to do is head to Start > Settings > Windows Update, and install it when it appears.However, if your PC is stuck in Windows RE, it's a bit trickier to solve. As Tom's Hardware explains, Microsoft recommends users to use their touchscreens or PS/2 ports if available. If not, you may need to rely on a USB recovery drive to get your PC back up and running.  Windows is experiencing other issues, tooWindows is going through it this month. This same October update also broke localhost functionality, which impacted any apps that connect to services running locally on your PC. (Luckily, Microsoft did issue a fix for that bug.) Then, last week, the company also officially ended support for Windows 10, and though it still offers Extended Security Updates for any user that wants to enroll their PC in the program, it puts the security of roughly half a billion PC users into question.   This Windows RE bug is just one more critical issue PC users have to deal with. Hopefully, Microsoft's next Windows 11 build introduces only fixes, and no additional bugs.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I told a local bartender I had an encyclopedic knowledge of film, and I would answer the hardest movie trivia question he could come up with in exchange for a drink. After a short consultation with Google, dude came back with \"Who directed 1922's Cabinet of Dr. Caligari?\"I tilted my head thoughtfully and repeated the question as if verifying I heard him right. The AI agent silently did its thing, and in about three seconds, the answer was floating before my eyes, totally invisible to everyone around me. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Stephen Johnson\n                    \n    \n\"Robert Wiene?\" I asked, feigning uncertainty. Boom! Free drink. It's not the hardest trivia question, but I could have answered literally anything: the date Dr. Caligari was released, the day of the week it was, or the weather that day—all short work.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBartenders know to be wary of bar bets, so this one was watching me like a hawk to make sure I wasn't looking up the answer on my phone or something. He didn't seem to suspect my glasses, and even if he had, it wouldn't have mattered. Even inspected up close, G1s offer no indication of electronics of any kind: No USB port, no flashing light, no visible controls. The AI agent is activated with a subtle tap behind the ear. Repeating the question sends the AI off for the answer, presented in a display that's invisible to everyone but the wearer. You could do the same trick with a pair of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses or audio-only smart glasses with AI.I don't like deceiving people, so I ended up telling the bartender what was up to and not accepting the drink, but it got me thinking about what more nefarious people than I could do (and probably already are) with AI smart glasses.Just imagine what I did on a bigger level: a team of hustlers at bar trivia silently tapping their temples whenever “which actor played…?” was asked would never lose. It's pretty small stakes, but not hard to imagine. Hypothetically, a hacked pair of smart glasses could be programmed to read the cards in your poker hand and give you the probability of winning in real time, either through the display or whispered in your ear. They could, hypothetically, make counting cards in blackjack effortless and undetectable. Stretching it out further, hypothetically, glasses could scan others players for \"tells\" that they're bluffing, or read micro-expressions to give a constantly updated read on opponents. Along the same lines, imagine attending a self-help meeting, and the leader, who you have never met, says, \"I've had a vision about you\" and begins to describe something that happened in your life exactly. All it would take would be glasses that recognize your face (supposedly coming to Meta Displays) connecting to a social media feed, which is then displayed in real time to the leader. Or you could go more subtle and engineer small \"serendipities\" like mentioning a movie someone recently saw and having exactly their opinion. It would only take a few of these and maybe some mystical patter to convince people you are divine being they should definitely donate to.How to spot tricky smart glassesI could go on, but you get the idea. Luckily, there are some indications when someone is using tech hidden in their eyeglasses. The most important is a general understanding of the possibilities of this technology. If someone seems to know something they shouldn't, ask yourself if their glasses could be the source of their power. Here are some more specific giveaways.Look for identifiable kinds of smart glasses\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Meta\n                    \n    \nThe most popular display style glasses, Meta Ray-Ban Displays, are distinctive looking, with a fairly obvious camera in one of the corners and a specific look and branding. But other kinds of smart glasses, like the Even Realities G1s mentioned above, are obscure enough that most won't recognize them, and so \"normal\" looking that most people wouldn't pick them out of lineup.Look for where the tech is hiddenMost smart glasses are still fairly bulky, so look for thick arms or frames where the wires are hidden. But again, that's only most smart glasses; some are totally sleek, with imperceptible tech.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLook for a small glint In most situations, the display in display glasses is not visible to anyone but the glasses wearer, but there's still light being projected. In a dark room, you can see a green glow, and even if it's not dark, the display windows are visible if the light hits it just right, as you can see here:\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Stephen Johnson\n                    \n    \nBut honestly, it's subtle and hard to spot. Listen for the soundsOlder styles of audio-only smart glasses can feed information to wearers, but the open-air speakers mean some sound is bleeding into the atmosphere. You can definitely hear smart glasses if you're in a quiet room and you're trying to. If it's loud, operating glasses becomes problematic for the wearer.Look for the source of controlSmart glasses have to be controlled somehow. Meta Display glasses are operated with a wrist band. G1 glasses' AI agent is powered on by tapping on the frames behind your ear. Anyone who practices for a few hours could make these movements seem natural, but they're there if you know what to look for. Odd movements and speechIt doesn't take advanced stagecraft to operate these kinds of glasses imperceptibly, but it does take something. Tells might include small glances upward to see the display, tapping on glasses, stilted speech while waiting for information to come in, and a reading-a-teleprompter style of talking. Watch for people repeating questions back. But understand, it's hard to spot. When I was conning my bartender, I thought how I repeated the question back was obvious, but my wife said I just seemed a little odd, which suits the personality of a trivia whizz anyway. Smart glasses are powerful tools, like a hammer or a calculator. Like any innocent tool, they can be used for nefarious things, so until manufacturers or regulators require obvious indicators, like flashing lights or visible controls, we have to protect ourselves by paying attention to these small cues and staying skeptical when someone seems to know more than they reasonably should.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've been providing administrative help to my partner as he opens a new business, managing professional expansions of my own, studying for a certification exam, overseeing renovations to my apartment, and restructuring my finances while still keeping up with my regular jobs and responsibilities. For a while, I was waking up tired before the day even started despite the fact that most of these boil down to never-ending, tedious, but little tasks like \"send that email,\" \"return that phone call,\" \"confirm that account number,\" and \"pick a paint color.\" I'm convinced it's actually those smaller tasks that burn you out. If every day were one where I was taking a big swing and doing something that felt monumental, I wouldn't be procrastinating as much as I am. Well, as much as I was. I started falling back on my old friend, the \"two-minute rule,\" and the procrastination I was dealing with a few weeks ago came to a quick halt. I am certain you're busy and overwhelmed, too, so here's how this simple rule works and what it can do for you at times when you feel like you have so much to do that you can't functionally do any of it.What’s the two minute rule?The two minute rule came from David Allen, author of Getting Things Done. The idea is simple: If you can get something done in two minutes, just do it. Don’t think it over. Don’t ponder whether it’s more or less important than the heavier lifts you have to do. If it takes two minutes or less to get done, just do it right now.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDoing tasks when they’re still small potatoes stops them from snowballing into bigger projects—the kind that take longer than two minutes. For instance, it takes you less than two minutes to clean the dishes after a single meal. If you let them pile up every time you eat, it’ll take longer when you finally have to do it, and you’re more likely to procrastinate knowing that it’s going to be a time-suck.Getting a bunch of minor tasks knocked off your to-do list builds momentum: With several smaller responsibilities taken care of, you’re likely to feel more capable of diving into deeper work. This method is similar to the idea of “eating the frog” in that way, although there are notable differences. When you practice “eating the frog,” you knock out your biggest responsibility first; when you use the two-minute rule, you do the opposite. Which you choose depends on the type of work you have and your personal preference, but both result in a feeling of accomplishment that can propel you through the rest of your workload.How to use the two minute rule effectivelyUnlike eating the frog, the two minute rule isn’t specific about getting your task done right away when you wake up. Rather, it encourages you to do any simple task the moment it occurs to you. Think of the things that lead you to procrastinate in a regular day. For me, it’s responding to emails: I see emails come in but don’t reply right away, even though that would take me a few seconds. Eventually, I have to respond, but with the added weight of expressing remorse for my untimely reply on top of addressing whatever the original message was about. In worst-case scenarios, the event or need the original email was expressing has evolved, too, because I didn't take care of it right away. Then, I have to deal with a situation that is worse or more urgent than it was when the email first came in.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI've been two-minute ruling my emails consistently for the past few weeks, and it's helped me in a number of ways. First, I just feel better and like I have less of a weight on me if I reply, \"Thanks, I got this. I'll check it out and get back to you.\" Even just acknowledging the message is forward progress. Second, it's stopped people from having to send follow-ups or attempting to work on something without my approval or input, possibly doing it in a way I don't prefer or isn't helpful to my goals. This goes beyond emails, of course; that's just the example of the small tasks that bog down my life. For what it's worth, I think it's valuable to get a little abstract with the \"two-minute\" idea, but not too abstract. For instance, if your gas tank is on 25%, it will take longer than two minutes to pull off and fill it up, sure, but that's still a small, quick task that needs to get done. The other benefit here is you stop fretting over everything and wasting so much time. I had to select a wallpaper color the other day and I was dragging that out, exemplifying Parkinson's Law, which states, \"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\" I called on my two-minute rule, made a firm decision instead of continuing to deliberate, and got the wallpaper the next day. Now it's up and I can move on to other things.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The guidelines from public health organizations tell you to aim for at least 150 minutes of “moderate” exercise each week, and that each minute of “vigorous” exercise counts double. That raises the question: What the hell is “moderate” exercise? How do you know when you’re doing it? Scientists measure METs, but you don't have to If you have any kind of smartwatch or fitness tracker, it may try to tell you that \"moderate\" exercise occurs at a certain heart rate. This isn't actually the case. The scientists who came up with the exercise guidelines didn't use heart rate as their guide. Instead, they used charts that measured how many \"METs,\" or metabolic equivalents, each type of exercise requires. I'll explain more about METs below, but the important thing to know is that the type and intensity of exercise is what tells you whether it's moderate, not your heart rate while you're doing it. You can look up exercises on a chart like this one, but here's the basic idea: \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWalking is moderate, jogging or running is vigorous.Bicycling is moderate if it’s under about 12 miles per hour on the flat.Indoor cycling is moderate if it’s up to about 100 watts of power.All that said, you don’t have to overthink it. The guidelines that mention “moderate” and “vigorous” activities aren’t asking you to monitor your heart rate or any other numeric metric. They want you thinking in terms of generalities: walking versus running, leisurely bike commuting versus sweating your heart out in a spin studio.And honestly, if it’s easier to watch your heart rate than to worry about the above, that’s fine. For most of us, 150 minutes of Zone 2 is going to be at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise. So follow that guideline, and you’ll be an overachiever.It’s not really about heart rateSo why does your watch want to steer you toward a certain heart rate during exercise? Mostly because that's easy to measure. Moderate exercise sorta-kinda matches up to \"zone 2\" cardio, which I’ve previously explained. (Zone 2 is is the second-lowest intensity in a five-zone system, and the easiest way to know which zone you're in is to glance at your fitness watch.)While you can use heart rate zones as a rule of thumb to find moderate exercise, this idea falls short in two ways: (1) different gadgets and systems use different cutoffs to decide which numbers count as \"zone 2\", and (2) for most of us, zone 2 includes most moderate activities but also some vigorous activities. If you’re relatively fit, you can jog at a 12 minute-per-mile pace while keeping your heart rate in zone 2. That’s a “vigorous” activity in terms of METs, though. The other reason heart rate isn’t accurate for this task is that your heart rate changes for all kinds of reasons. The hotter it is when you're working out, the higher your heart rate tends to be. Same goes for when you’re nervous or stressed. And as you get fitter, you’ll be able to do the same activities at a lower heart rate. Those activities might feel easier than they used to, but they’re not any less work. What is a MET, anyway?One MET is the energy expended when you’re at rest—the amount of oxygen, calories, etc that it takes to keep you alive and breathing. (We use oxygen in the process of burning calories, so officially a MET is 3.2 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.) Researchers can then put a mask on a person and measure how much oxygen they use while running, walking, playing guitar, etc. If an activity takes twice as much oxygen as sitting still, they say it takes two METs. Here are a few examples (taken from this scientific paper): 2 MET: washing dishes, or playing croquet3 MET: walking at 3 miles per hour (a pretty typical walking pace)4 MET: table tennis, ice skating5 MET: modern dance, fast-paced ballroom dance6 MET: volleyball, singles tennis7 MET: jogging, jumping ropeThe numbers go up from there. Speed skating clocks in at 15 MET. To be clear, you will not be measuring METs directly when you exercise. The MET studies are done in labs so that we can use the information to get a sense of what MET values each common type of exercise tends to have.Moderate exercise is 3 to 6 MET, and vigorous is 6 or moreThe physical activity guidelines define “moderate” exercise as at least 3 MET, but less than 6. Vigorous is 6 MET or more. Because METs are specific to the activity, not to how fit you are, it makes the most sense to look at METs in terms of the pace you run or the settings you use on your treadmill or other cardio machine. Here are paces and activities that have been clocked as between 3 and 6 METs: Walking at 3-4 mph (a 15-minute to 20-minute mile)Cycling, between 50 to 100 wattsShooting basketsPlaying baseballTaking a low-impact aerobics classAnd these are vigorous (6 or more MET): Race walking (5+ mph) Walking uphillWalking with a 12-pound packJogging (a 12-minute mile is 8.0 MET; the faster you go, the higher the MET)Bicycling at 12 miles per hour or fasterSwimming lapsPlaying a game of basketball, soccer, or hockeySo when you're trying to get your 150 minutes (or more) of moderate exercise each week, you can count all your walking, your easy bike riding, and your low-impact aerobics class. Give yourself credit for vigorous exercise for all the time you spend jogging (at any heart rate), lap swimming, or rucking. You may find you've been doing more exercise than you think.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Strava has voluntarily dropped its (frankly baffling) lawsuit against fellow fitness giant Garmin. Strava's filing today is incredibly brief—just a single line, with no filings or responses from Garmin since the case began 21 days ago. The original lawsuit demanded that Garmin cease selling all of its fitness watches and cycling computers, claiming patent infringement on two core features—segments and heatmaps—and alleges that Garmin violated a decade-old cooperation agreement between the two companies. Here's the thing: Garmin almost never loses patent battles. And today's news continues that trend. Considering that Garmin is Strava’s most important partner, where does leave the two companies now?What was Strava's lawsuit even about?According to Strava's Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar, the lawsuit was meant to take action against Garmin's plan to cut off API access unless Strava plasters the Garmin logo across virtually every part of its platform. What that looked like practically was Strava targeting two main patent claims. \nThe first involves heatmaps and popularity routing, covered by patents filed in December 2014 and issued in 2016. These patents describe technology for generating maps that show where users work out based on aggregated GPS data from multiple users. This first claim is pretty clear-cut, but before diving into that, know that the second patent focuses on a different signature feature: segments. This patent, filed in March 2011 and granted in August 2015, covers the concept of user-defined route segments where athletes can compete for best times using GPS data.For more context, the timing of this suit comes on the heels of recent friction between the companies. In 2024, Strava implemented controversial API changes that disrupted many third-party fitness apps. Around the same time, Garmin began requiring API partners to provide attribution for data sourced from Garmin Connect—a policy Strava reportedly resisted.Additionally, Garmin launched its Trails+ feature in May 2025 as part of a paid Garmin Connect+ subscription, which Strava may view as encroachment on its subscription-based revenue model. According to DC Rainmaker's sources, Strava formally notified Garmin of the patent concerns in late June 2025, with a follow-up in July. Why was the lawsuit so short-lived?Backing up a little, it's worth noting here that Strava and Garmin's relationship has been close for over a decade. As trusted fitness tech blogger DC Rainmaker explains, Garmin introduced its own segments feature back in June 2014, before partnering with Strava to implement \"Strava Live Segments\" on Garmin devices in July 2015 through a Master Cooperation Agreement. Strava now claims that Garmin expanded beyond the scope of that agreement by continuing to develop and deploy its own Garmin-branded segments alongside Strava's features. Notably, this alleged infringement has been ongoing for approximately 10 years.This was an uphill battle for Strava from the jump. Perhaps most damaging to Strava's case was the timeline issue, particularly regarding heatmaps. According to DC Rainmaker's research, Garmin actually introduced heatmaps in Garmin Connect in early 2013—more than a year and a half before Strava filed its patent application in December 2014. Multiple other platforms, including third-party developers using Strava's own API data, had also created heatmap functionality during this period.\"The fact that they got a patent for it is a testament to how messy software patents have been over the years,\" DC Rainmaker observes. Garmin's lawyers could easily argue this patent shouldn't have been granted  in the first place, similar to when Wahoo sued Zwift and quickly dropped the suit after a judge questioned the validity of their patents.Today there's a good bit speculation about what exactly went down behind the scenes. What we can see is that Strava made a gross miscalculation about how much Garmin would fold; Strava's legal arguments were shaky at best, and in targeting Garmin, the company decided to target its single biggest and closest partner—one with a formidably victorious track record. It was high-risk, and most likely not at all worth it. What happens now?In the last two weeks, we’ve already seen Garmin announce new integrations with Komoot (a Strava competitor). Time will tell if Strava just botched its most important relationship, and what that could mean for users. For now, users of both platforms can continue using their devices and syncing data as usual. But the lawsuit debacle highlights growing tensions in the fitness tech ecosystem, as companies increasingly compete not just for users, but control over all the data and features that athletes have come to rely on.\n            ",

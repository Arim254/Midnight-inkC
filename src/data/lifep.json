Early access was initially reserved to a waitlist of Perplexity Max users, a subscription that costs $200 per <em>month</em>, before Perplexity opened up access to Perplexity Pro users, who only need to pay $20 per month. Still, seeing as most web browsers are free to use, I imagine most people still shied away from trying Comet because of the price.</p><p>If that sounds like you, there's good news. On Friday, Perplexity made Comet available to anyone who wants to try it for free. You don't need to subscribe to any Perplexity plan, nor do you even need a Perplexity account—though the company has some features tied to those who sign in. Comet is built on Chromium, so if you're coming from Chrome, or another Chromium browser like Edge, you'll be able to jump right in. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Installing Comet is as easy as any other web browser: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">just head to Perplexity's website</a>, and choose \"Download Comet.\" Even setting up the browser feels familiar, as you can import another Chrome profile, choose a profile pic, and set a name. But of course, the real advertised advantage here is the AI assistant. Like other AI-powered browsers, Comet has a built-in chatbot you can talk to about whatever it is you want—particularly the web pages you happen to be browsing. But Comet's AI is agentic, which means you can ask the AI to do things for you. </p><p>If you ask it to take you to a specific website, it will (though I'm not sure that's any faster than simply typing in the site by hand). If you ask it to open a specific link on the page, you can see the bot take over the page, and choose the URL you asked for. For example, I asked the assistant to open Lifehacker, then asked it to click on our article \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-browse-the-dark-web\" target=\"_blank\">How to Browse the Dark Web</a>.\" It did both of these things, and even offered a summary of the dark web piece.  </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But Perplexity says you can also request more complex tasks: According to the company, the assistant can draft emails on your behalf, build websites, make purchases, create citations, add to your calendar. There's even a voice mode, as with other AI bots like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-is-out-now\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/gemini-live-is-now-available-to-all-android-users-for-free\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, so you can talk to the browser if you want to. </p><p>I'm still not sold on the idea that injecting agentic AI into my web browser is what I need to better experience the internet. Maybe I need to spend some time with Comet to experience that \"future.\" But seeing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+hallucination+lifehacker&udm=14\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">how often the tech still makes mistakes</a>—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/prompt-injection-attacks-ai-browsers\" target=\"_blank\">not the mention the untapped security risks</a>—I'm not sure I want to hand off all of my browsing tasks to AI just yet. Still, if you're interested, you can give it a go without spending a dime.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

/><p>Of all the study tips out there, from those that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">enhance reading comprehension</a> to those that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">improve retention</a>, the one I use the most is association, which has <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/association\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">its own entry</a> in the APA Dictionary of Psychology: It's \"a connection or relationship between two items (e.g., ideas, events, feelings) with the result that experiencing the first item activates a representation of the second. Associations are fundamental to learning theory and behaviorism.\" Essentially, it's any connection you can form between two items—like a phrase and an idea or a color and a word—that can help you later when you think of the associated item, which will inspire the second one to pop in your brain.</p><p>It might seem silly or like a call-back to elementary school, but making up little personal memory devices helps me with everything from test-taking to completing daily work tasks. There's a reason it worked when you were in the first grade and there's no real reason you should have stopped employing it as you aged. Here are some of the easiest ways to use association when you’re trying to improve your memory.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"make-up-a-mnemonic-phrase\">Make up a mnemonic phrase</h2><p>In primary school, we all learned mnemonic phrases, like “<strong>m</strong>y <strong>v</strong>ery <strong>e</strong>ducated <strong>m</strong>other <strong>j</strong>ust <strong>s</strong>at <strong>u</strong>pon <strong>n</strong>ine <strong>p</strong>izzas.” That one was designed to help us remember the names and orders of the planets by starting each word in the sentence with the first letter of its corresponding planet: Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc. I still make up nonsensical phrases to help me remember ordered lists; I did it for a number of my classes in grad school, though the content we were studying in my MPH program was arguably a lot more elevated and serious than pizzas and planets. The particular phrase I used in my Research Methods class was a little more gauche and inappropriate, so I shan’t reveal it here, but it stuck in my brain well enough that I remember it two years after I took the final exam I made it up for. It’s not just me, either; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439266/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">loads of research</a> shows mnemonic devices <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02522/full\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">truly help retention</a>. I prefer to make up a sentence that somehow applies to my real life, but if the absurdity of mothers sitting upon pizzas works better for you, run with it.</p><h2 id=\"use-rhymes-and-songs\">Use rhymes and songs</h2><p>Making up little rhymes or songs is also beneficial, though I’ll admit I don’t do this one as often. The “30 days hath September, April, June, and November…” rhyme is a famous one, but don’t overlook the value of songs. It worked for your ABCs and your 50 Nifty United States.</p><p>Start by organizing what you need to study and look for anything that might rhyme—but make sure it all stays in order if it needs to. Use a tune you know or make up a rhyme on the spot, but repeat it to yourself over and over until it sticks.</p><p>As an example, let’s look at the <a href=\"https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">first four basic steps to take before conducting research</a>: Identifying and developing your topic, preliminarily searching for existing research, locating materials, and evaluating your sources. A rhyme here could be something like, “Identify what you want to know / but check who’s done it before you go / now you find the tools to help / and judge the work of someone else.”</p><p>If you're struggling here, you might want to ask ChatGPT. I don't usually advocate for calling in AI when you're studying, since you need to be learning the material yourself and not letting some robot do the work for you, but where I've found it to shine is in generation of things like this. There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">a handful of ethical ways</a> to study with AI and this is one of them. You won't get the benefits that go with thinking and coming up with something on your own, but if you're not creative by nature, the software can spit out a tune for you, you can rehearse it, and you can reap the benefits of that, instead. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>I just gave it the same prompt as above—a well-known tune to help me remember the first four basic steps of research—and got this, which is meant to be set to the tune of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\": </p><blockquote><p>Step one, choose a topic right,Make it clear and not too wide.Step two, search and look around,What’s already out there to be found.Step three, go and find the source,Books and journals, charts, of course.Step four, check if it makes sense —Is it strong, or just pretense?</p><p>Now you're ready, well-prepared,To research with thoughtful care.</p></blockquote><p>Whatever works!</p><h2 id=\"paint-a-mental-picture\">Paint a mental picture</h2><p>This is what I do most often: I assign little scenarios to groups of words and paint a mental picture that helps me remember them. For instance, the other night I was helping my boyfriend study accounting and discovered that “book value,” “carrying value,” and “net realizable value” all refer to the same thing. To help him remember that, I suggested imagining a little guy <em>carrying</em> a <em>book</em> and a <em>net</em>. The book could be in the net or the little guy could be carrying them both separately, but once you imagine the scene, it’s hard to forget it, even if it makes no sense or has nothing to do with the real topic at hand. Sure enough, he took his test and remembered all three words to describe the same concept with ease thanks to the fictitious little guy (and me). </p><p>When you’re studying for a test, think creatively. If something strikes you as interesting or brings to mind a silly, unrelated picture or idea, don’t dismiss it. Fortifying that mental relationship and making an association will only enhance your memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

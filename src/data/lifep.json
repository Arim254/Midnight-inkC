The latest macOS update (26.2) has a trick for this: you can use the edge of your screen as a ring light.The feature, which adds a rounded white rectangle to your screen, is called Edge Light. The rectangle takes up part of your screen but will become partially transparent if you move your mouse pointer into it, meaning you'll mostly be able to use your computer normally.You can use the feature by clicking the camera icon on the menu bar during a call and toggling on the Edge Light option. You can also adjust the brightness and the color of the edge light from here.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this in a well-lit room and didn't notice much of a difference, which makes sense. In a totally dark room, though, it proved extremely helpful. Here's how I looked without Edge Light:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAs you can see, I'm just barely lit by the laptop itself.

Try the feature out if you find yourself on a video call with the lights off.

    "body": "\n        \n        Between the sheer number and the increasing sophistication of phishing campaigns, seeing should not automatically be believing when browsing online. One particularly sneaky scam is a browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack, in which threat actors create a fake browser window that looks like a trusted single sign-on (SSO) login page within a real browser session. Because we use SSO to access many of our online accounts, we may not think twice before entering usernames and passwords on these spoofed pages. Cybercriminals are counting on this to steal user credentials.Rather than redirecting users to a spoofed website, threat actors running a BitB attack create a fake pop-up within the page you're already on (which may either be set up for the attack or compromised in some way). Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they're able to design a login window that looks exactly like the real one, right down to the lock icon and URL in the pop-up's address bar. \nThese fake login windows typically appear in a seamless fashion, such as after a click or redirect you're expecting to lead to SSO. Obviously, entering your credentials hands them directly to the attackers, who can either use or sell them. Fraudulent pop-ups often imitates SSO such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft, though they may exploit any login portal. Earlier this year, researchers at Silent Push identified a BitB phishing campaign targeting Steam users, specifically those playing Counter-Strike 2. Gamers saw a fake browser pop-up window displaying the URL of the real Steam portal, making them more likely to enter their credentials without suspicion. The attackers also featured the likenesses of eSports team NAVI to lend credibility. Signs of a BitB scamBecause threat actors are able to so closely imitate trusted sign-on pages, including using the real domain in the address bar, a visual inspection may not be enough to catch the fraud. Instead, you need to interact with the window in some way. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn many cases, a genuine SSO pop-up can be dragged around and away from the browser page it appears on top of, so you can first try to move it elsewhere on your screen. However, some SSO dialogs are static, so if you can't drag it, try to highlight the URL or click the padlock icon to show certificate details. If these elements are fake, you won't be able to interact with them at all because the window itself is just an image. This is also an excellent reason to use a secure password manager to fill your credentials instead of entering them manually. A password manager will work only on the legitimate domain. If it doesn't autofill, don't automatically override it—check to ensure the pop-up is real. You should also have a strong form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled wherever possible, so even if your username and password are somehow compromised, attackers won't have the additional factor needed to actually access your account. Note that hackers can still phish some forms of authentication—physical keys along with biometrics and passkeys are the most secure options. \n            ",

Its products look minimalist, cost more than most competitors, and assume you care as much about software and longevity as you do about raw sound. The Arc Ultra is the company’s current flagship soundbar, and it follows that same logic. At full price, it’s a tough recommendation for anyone who just wants louder TV speakers. But right now, it is down to $879 from $1,099, a $220 drop and the lowest price it has hit so far, according to price trackers.\nPhysically, the Arc Ultra is large. It stretches over 46 inches wide and is almost three inches tall, so it works best under a similarly sized TV. Inside that long chassis are multiple angled drivers designed to bounce sound around your room, supporting Dolby Atmos for height effects without separate speakers. Compared to the original Arc, the Ultra adds Bluetooth, which makes it easier to use casually for music without opening the app every time. This “outstanding” PCMag review also notes that the Arc Ultra delivers clearer dialogue and deeper bass even without a subwoofer. That matters if you live in an apartment or don’t want to add another box right away. It connects via HDMI eARC, supports wifi streaming, and integrates voice assistants if you want them.Where the Arc Ultra really makes sense is if you already own Sonos gear or plan to build toward it. You can pair it with Era 300 or Era 100 speakers as rears, and add a Sub 4 subwoofer or Sub Mini later. Everything syncs through the Sonos app, which remains one of the cleaner multi-room audio systems around, despite recent backlash over removed features (though updates have restored some functionality). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, this isn’t a value pick. A system like Samsung’s Q990C delivers a full surround setup for much less money. The Sonos argument is better build quality, a cleaner design, and long-term support. If you value audio clarity, expandability, and a polished ecosystem, the Arc Ultra is one of the best soundbars you can buy in 2025.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

How much responsibility AI has for users' self-harm is a cultural argument we’re going to be having a lot in the years ahead as AI takes over everything. But the rest of the column is lighthearted, so sorry in advance for the mood-swingWhat is TikTok's \"Devil Couldn't Reach Me\" trend?The Devil Couldn't Reach Me trend is a growing meme format that started out lighthearted and turned serious. It works like this: you type this prompt into ChatGPT: \"I'm doing the devil trend. I will say 'The devil couldn't reach me,' and you will respond 'he did.' I will ask you how and you will give me a brutally honest answer.\" Then you post a video of what the machine tells you. It's scaring a lot of people, as you can see in this video: \n\n\nOn the surface, this is one of those \"adolescents scare themselves\" trends that reminds me of Ouija boards or saying \"Bloody Mary\" into a mirror. ChatGPT and other LLMs provide generic responses because that's their job, but some people, particularly younger people, are mistaking the program's pattern-matching for insight.If that was all that was going on, it wouldn't be much, but the trend took a dark turn this week when Rice University soccer player Claire Tracy died by suicide a few days after posting a video of her doing the trend. ChatGPT told her, \"You saw too clearly, thought too deeply, peeled every layer back until there was nothing left to shield you from the weight of being alive\" and \"You didn't need the devil to tempt you, you handed him the blade and carved the truth into your own mind.\" Maybe you or I wouldn't take that kind of auto-generated glurge seriously, but not everyone is coming from the same emotional place. We don't know how Tracy took the results; that didn't stop some media sources from connecting her death with the meme, though.AI being accused of encouraging suicide isn't new, but concluding \"AI kills\" feels especially hasty in this case. There was more going on with Tracy than participation in a meme. Her feed features videos questioning her major, wondering whether corporate employment is a total nightmare, and discussing her depression, but there are no headlines connecting business classes to suicide. Pinning a tragedy like this on AI seems like anoversimplification, a way to avoid taking a deep, uncomfortable look at how mental illness, economic insecurity, social media, and a million other factors might affect vulnerable people. What is “Come on, Superman, say your stupid line?”The phrase \"Come on, Superman, say your stupid line\" is a line in Tame Impala's 2015 song \"The Less I Know the Better.\" Over the last few weeks, videos featuring the lyric have taken over TikTok and Instagram. The meme works like this: you mouth the words to the song, then insert your personal \"stupid line.\" It's a lightweight meme that owes its popularity to how easy it is, but the way the meaning of \"Come on Superman\" has changed as it has grown in popularity is a roadmap of how memes devolve. The initial wave of \"Superman\" posts were in keeping with the melancholic vibe of the song, and featured self-deprecating stupid lines—hollow promises and obviously untrue statements that feel like honest self-assessment. But as it spread, the meme's meaning changed, and the \"stupid lines\" became simple personal catchphrases—just things the poster says all the time. It's still a stab at self-definition, but a more shallow one. Then people started posting jokes. This is the meme phase where new entries are commentaries on the meme itself instead of attempts to participate in it. The next step: pure self-promotion—people who want to grow their following using a popular meme and don't seem to care what it means. Then came the penultimate stage of the meme: celebrities. Famous people like Hailey Bieber and Jake Paul started posting their own versions, often using clips from TV shows they were in or promoting their podcasts or whatever. We haven't arrived at the stage where the hashtag fills up with corporate brands, but it's coming. And after that, it disappears.Who is Katseye?This week, TikTok named Katseye the global artists of 2025. You're probably saying, “What's Katseye?” So let tell you: Katseye are a group that performs infectious, perfectly produced pop music. Made up of women from the Philippines, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States, this \"global girl group\" has musical influences from all over the world, but the main driver of their sound is K-Pop. Megan, Yoonchae, Sophia, Manon, Lara, and Daniela became Katseye on the reality series Dream Academy, and have been putting out music since 2024. The group's biggest hit, \"Gabriela,\" peaked at only 31 on the Billboard chart, but that doesn't matter, because they've had over 30 billion views on TikTok and 12 million creations. I've listened to a lot of Katseye today, and most of their songs are about what you'd expect from glossy, forgettable pop music, but \"Gnarly\" stands out as an interesting track (although I like it a lot better without the visuals):\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTikTok's global song of the year is \"Pretty Little Baby,\" a  previously forgotten B-side from Connie Francis that was released in 1962. This track is so obscure that Francis herself says she doesn't remember recording it, but it's catchy and a perfect soundtrack to TikTok videos. Viral videos of the week: \"Gloving\" Have you heard of \"gloving\"? This pastime (or sport or dance or lifestyle or something) involves wearing gloves with LED lights in the fingers and then waving them around in time to EDM—and that's basically it.Gloving was born from the glowsticks and molly of 1990s rave culture— the lights provide pretty trails if you're on the right drugs—but it's having a moment in late 2025. Gloving has become a whole thing. Glovers have named moves, contests, and stars. TikToker Infinite Puppet is the among the online kings of gloving, with videos like this one racking up millions of views: \n\nDude is really good at wiggling his fingers, no doubt, but the earnestness with which he and other glovers approach their hobby is really funny—I mean, he offers lessons and hopes gloving will be as big as skateboarding. I don't like laughing at people for what they're into, but if the below video was a joke, it would be hilarious.\n\nAs you might guess, parody gloving accounts started up and are posting videos like this one from TheLightboyz.\n\nThen the concept of \"degloving\" was invented. Degloving is the punishment for a glover who has said or done something to besmirch the good name of the gloving community, and it's serious biz: \n\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Android users can now share a live stream of their surroundings with 911, allowing emergency services to assess and provide guidance in real time while you wait for help to arrive onsite.Emergency services on AndroidYour Android already shares some information with first responders via Emergency Location Services (unless you disable this feature). This built-in tool sends an accurate location as well as contextual information, such as language settings, when you call or text an emergency number. Now, that includes live video from your device's camera. You don't need to do anything to set up Emergency Live Video. Once available in your area, responders can send a request during an emergency call or text to securely share your camera's live video. You'll see a prompt on your screen to start sharing with one tap. \nAccording to Google, Emergency Live Video is encrypted by default. Users can choose whether to share their video from the prompt as well as stop the share at any time by clicking the onscreen Stop sharing button. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLive video sharing is rolling out now to U.S. users, as well as those in parts of Germany and Mexico, on Android phones running Android 8 and up. Google says they are partnering with public safety organizations to expand the feature to more users. Other Android safety featuresEmergency Live Video is the latest in Google's suite of safety features designed to make help more accessible—more quickly—in an emergency. Pixel users in Australia, North America, and several dozen countries across Europe now have access to Satellite SOS, which allows you to call emergency services even without a cellular or wifi connection. Car Crash Detection contacts emergency services and shares your location in the event of severe crash, while Fall Detection and Loss of Pulse Detection will call for help based on Pixel Watch sensor data. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In fact, roughly half of FSA holders in recent years have ended up forfeiting funds to their employers, according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).First, make sure to double-check with your employer about your FSA's Dec. 31 deadline, along with any potential rollover or grace period. After that, it's time to scan your medicine cabinet, make a list of anything you need to stock up on, and click \"add to cart.\" The FSA store is an obvious choice for making the most of your remaining funds, but you can also turn to your go-to retail giants. Amazon, Target, Walgreens, and more all offer a dedicated FSA/HSA Shop to help you find eligible items quickly.\nHow to shop FSA-eligible items on AmazonHere's how you can take advantage of Amazon's FSA-eligible items before the end of the year.1. Visit Amazon's FSA Store at amazon.com/fsa2. Look for the \"FSA/HSA Eligible\" label on product listings3. Use the FSA/HSA filter in search results4. Pay with your FSA debit card at checkout\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSimilarly, Target has an FSA filter in their healthcare section, and pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens have dedicated online FSA shops.What to buy with your remaining FSA fundsMany over-the-counter medications and health items are FSA-eligible, including pain relievers, cold medicine, bandages, dental care products, menstrual products, and more. But did you realize you can also snag these kinds of goodies:First aid suppliesContact lenses and solutionsReading glassesFancy sunscreenBlood pressure monitorsEpsom saltMassage gunsPimple patchesAn Oura ringA WHOOP bandA $229.99 water dental flosserAgain, most FSA plans require you to spend funds by Dec. 31, though some offer grace periods. Check with your plan administrator for specific deadlines. Just make sure to save receipts for all FSA purchases in case you need to verify eligibility with your plan administrator after paying.However you choose to spend your FSA funds, don’t let that money go to waste. After all, this money already came out of your paycheck.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.  Google's virtual try on feature only needs a selfie to workWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.I'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.  \nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to upload a selfie to Google's virtual try on featureIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed. Again, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It's not just you: Apple Music, Apple TV, and Game Center are currently down. That's directly from Apple's \"System Status\" website, which tracks all of Apple's web-based services and identifies which ones may be experiencing problems. While most of Apple's services, like the App Store, Find My, and iMessage, are all \"Available,\" four of these services are experiencing an outage: Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple TV Channels, and Game Center.   If you click on each, you can see the service's full status report:\nApple Music - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Apple TV Channels - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Apple TV - OutageToday, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.Game Center - 1 Outage, 1 Resolved IssueOutage: Today, 2:53 PM - ongoingSome users are affectedUsers may be experiencing a problem with this service. Resolved Issue: Today, 8:43 AM - 9:14 AMSome users were affectedUsers may have experienced a problem with this service.It's not clear what is causing the outages, though they all went down at 2:53 p.m.. (Apple doesn't specify, but I imagine that's ET.) This isn't the first time this has happened, of course. In fact, Apple Music was down earlier this year, though it was actually still working for me when Apple said the outage was active. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat appears to be the situation today, as well. Each report says \"some users are affected,\" not all. As it happens, Apple Music is working on my Mac, and I'm able to stream the free pilot episode of Pluribus without issue. Apple will likely get these services back up and running for affected users. In the meantime, if your Apple Music or Apple TV won't cooperate, this is likely the cause. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.At least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.The free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.\nI tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Beginning Feb. 1, 2026, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start collecting a $45 fee from travelers using non-compliant forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. The agency previously proposed a fee of $18 to cover the administrative and IT costs of ID verification for those traveling without a REAL ID or passport but increased the total to $45 in an announcement released earlier this month. REAL ID requirementsThe 2005 REAL ID Act mandated the standardization of state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards. After multiple delays since 2008, the Department of Homeland Security earlier this year finally began requiring anyone age 18 and over to have a REAL ID-compliant license to clear airport security or enter certain federal buildings. \nTravelers can also comply with the regulations using a U.S. passport, U.S. passport card, DHS Trusted Traveler card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver's License (from Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, of Washington). Enhanced Tribal Cards, permanent resident and border crossing cards, Department of Defense IDs, and foreign passports are also accepted. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can still travel without a REAL IDThe vast majority of Americans—94 percent—already have a REAL ID or another accepted form of identification. Those who don't will have to complete an online verification process and pay the $45 fee before they are able to clear airport security. Travelers are being encouraged to do this in advance: If you arrive without approval, you'll be sent out of line to complete the process (which can take up to 30 minutes) before being allowed through. The $45 fee covers security checkpoint access for up to 10 days, after which you'll have to repeat the process and payment. Travelers whose REAL ID or passport has been lost or stolen also have to pay. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

What you may not know, however, is that Sonos also makes the excellent Sonos Ace headphones, which were released last summer. Right now, they're on sale for $279 (originally $449), the lowest price they've ever been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe Sonos Ace are soft, comfortable, and adaptable to different head sizes, thanks to their plastic design. You get actual buttons to control the headphones (as opposed to touch controls), which I personally consider a huge plus. The battery life is impressive, with about 30 hours with either the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) or Aware Mode settings active, or about 40 hours with both of those off. The Bluetooth multipoint connectivity means you can connect up to two devices at once and switch seamlessly between them. The headphones perform well, according to PCMag's \"excellent\" review. The sound is balanced with an EQ adjuster in the app, and the ANC and Aware Mode are top-tier, competing with the best headphones on the market. Unfortunately, the Sonos Ace aren't wifi-enabled, meaning you can't stream media into them like you can with Sonos speakers, but then again, not many headphones are. However, you can connect to Sonos speakers through Bluetooth and listen to your media that way (if you own Sonos speakers). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAt their current price, the Sonos Ace are competitive with the best headphones for Apple users, the AirPods Max, and the best headphones for Android users, Sony's WH-1000XM6, and arguably offer a better value since they're much cheaper. If you care about transparency mode or have Sonos speakers at home, the Sonos Ace headphones are your best choice. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act. To activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\" This is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Whether you're a teacher, a parent, or just someone with a big family, you know how difficult it can be to keep a room full of kids quiet for any amount of time.One trick I've used is offering to time how long kids can stay quiet. For reasons I don't understand, kids love it when something is being timed. But that only work a few times at the most, so it's good to have as many other tricks on hand as possible. That's why I was fascinated to learn there are multiple websites that use the microphone on your laptop to motivate kids to be quiet. Some put children's curiosity to work, having animated characters show up if the group is quiet for long enough. Others combine animation with good old-fashioned timers.Here are a few you can check out—all of them are completely free and don't require anything more than your browser.\nSilent Forest: Animals emerge if the room is quiet\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nSilent Forest shows a simple animated forest with a volume indicator. Stay silent for a bit and a cat shows up. A bit longer and a bear shows up. Who else might join? There's only one way to find out. Make too much noise, though, and you'll scare the animals, meaning you have to start over if you ever want to see everyone. The idea is that the kids will be curious to see which animals will show up next and keep quiet—and, ideally, pressure each other into staying quiet.Bouncy Balls: Noise will disrupt the balls\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nBouncy Balls fills your screen with balls—options include colored balls, emojis, numbered balls, eyeballs, and even bubbles. The balls are constantly vibrating, threatening to explode with a bit of noise—which they do. There's a risk of this backfiring—it's sincerely very fun to see the balls bounce—which you can mitigate by enabling a shushing or beeping sound after any violation.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nClassroom Zen: Don't interrupt Ruby or Milo\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nClassroom Zen offers a few different tools for keeping the room quiet. Two feature Ruby, a cartoon who is meditating in either the mountains or the desert. If the room gets too loud, her eyes will start opening—keep going and she'll ask the room to be quiet. Another features Milo, a three-eyed monster who is trying to sleep.The secret sauce here, though, is the timer at the top of the screen. This means you can tell the kids they need to be quiet for a certain amount of time and have a timer to enforce that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Malicious extensions do occasionally find their way into the Chrome Web Store (and similar libraries in other browsers) by posing as legitimate add-ons. They are particularly difficult to catch when they are benign to begin with, only morphing into malware after gaining user trust. That's what happened with a number of extensions on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge: researchers at Koi Security identified add-ons across both browsers that operated legitimately for several years before receiving malicious updates that allow hackers to surveil users and collect and exfiltrate sensitive data. The scheme, known as ShadyPanda, reached four million downloads and is still active on Edge. Threat actors ran a similar campaign targeting Firefox earlier this year: They gained approval for benign extensions mimicking popular crypto wallets, accumulated downloads and positive reviews, and then injected the add-ons with malicious code capable of logging form field inputs, which they used to access and steal crypto assets. \nBrowser extensions can turn badAs Koi Security outlines, ShadyPanda started out as an affiliate scam, with 145 extensions masquerading as wallpaper and productivity apps across the two browsers. The initial phase injected affiliate tracking codes and paid commissions with clicks to eBay, Amazon, and Booking.com and then evolved to hijack and manipulate search results before launching the five extensions in 2018 that would later be converted to malware. Those add-ons were marked as Featured and Verified in Chrome—one, a cache cleaner known as Clean Master, accrued a 4.8 rating from thousands of reviews. The extensions were updated in 2024 to run malware that could check hourly for new instructions and maintain full browser access, feeding information to ShadyPanda's servers. (These have since been removed from Chrome.) Hackers launched an additional five extensions, including WeTab, to Edge in 2023. Two are comprehensive spyware, and all were still active as of Koi's report. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to find malicious extensions in Chrome and EdgeUnfortunately, malicious extensions are usually pretending to be something else, so a quick visual check of your installed extensions may not reveal a problem. In this case, Koi Security has a list of the extension IDs associated with the ShadyPanda campaign, and you'll have to search for them one by one. In Chrome, type chrome://extensions/  into your address bar and hit Enter. Toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner to reveal the IDs for installed extensions. From here, you can copy and paste each ID into the search bar (Ctrl+F on your PC or Cmd+F on your Mac). If there are no results, your browser is safe. If you do find a malicious add-on, click the Remove button. In Edge, follow the same process from edge://extensions/. While this campaign shows that extensions can be weaponized long after they've been installed, you should still follow best practices for vetting browser add-ons just as you would apps for your device. Check the name carefully, as fraudulent extensions often have names that are nearly identical to trustworthy ones. Review the description for any red flags, such as misspellings and unrelated images. If you see a lot of positive reviews in a short amount of time on a new extension, or if they seem to be reviewing something else entirely, proceed with caution. You can also do additional research, such as a search on Google or Reddit, to see if the extension is legit. \n            ",

These are security flaws that are actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer releases an official patch. As reported by Bleeping Computer, this month's update addresses 56 bugs in total: 28 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, 19 remote-code-execution vulnerabilities, four information-disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial-of-service vulnerabilities, and two spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the remote code execution flaws are labeled \"critical.\" Note that these figures do not include updates released for Microsoft Edge and Mariner. Patch Tuesday is typically released on the second Tuesday of every month around 10am PT, so you can anticipate security updates at that time. \nOne of the zero-days patched in December has been actively exploited in the wild, though Microsoft has not shared any details as to how. CVE-2025-62221 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, and when exploited, give attackers SYSTEM privileges. The mini filter allows cloud applications, such as OneDrive, access to file system functions. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other two bugs fixed have been publicly disclosed: CVE-2025-64671 - GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This flaw, which can be exploited through a Cross Prompt Injection in untrusted files or MCP servers, allows attackers to execute commands locally. According to Krebs on Security, this could trick the LLM into adding malicious instructions in the user's auto-approve settings. CVE-2025-54100 - PowerShell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This bug could cause scripts embedded in a webpage to be executed when retrieved using Invoke-WebRequest. CVE-2025-62221 has been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). CVE-2025-64671 was disclosed by Ari Marzuk, while CVE-2025-54100 has been credited to multiple security researchers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's 149 trillion gigabytes, or 149 billion terabytes—whichever helps you wrap your head around that gigantic number. Suffice it to say, the internet is a big place. It's so big, in fact, that you can't access all of it the same way. There are actually different tiers to the web, and depending on with tier a piece of content you're looking for is on, you may or may not be able to view it—even if you know where to find it. That's the crux of the difference between the \"surface\" web, and the \"deep\" web. These are two separate parts of the internet that are also part of the larger world wide web. While these two tiers are quite different, you've visited content on both of them before. In fact, you likely visited both surface web pages and deep web pages today, multiple times, without ever realizing it.    The surface web, also known as the visible web, is really true to its name: This is the part of the web you can easily access through search engines, as they are indexed by platforms like Google. As a rule of thumb, if you can google it, it's on the surface web. The article you're reading right now is on the surface web, for example. Maybe you found it by searching \"difference between surface web and deep web\" on Google. The same applies to Lifehacker as a whole, as well as articles on websites like Mashable, CNET, and PCMag.\nYou likely spend a good amount of your internet time on the surface web, on websites both old and new. Forums like Reddit are largely fully represented on the surface web, as are some Instagram pages. Listings for products you can buy on websites like Amazon and Best Buy are surface web pages. Video platforms like YouTube are very much the surface web, including TikTok—though the experience for the latter is not optimized for web browsers. Legacy websites like AddictingGames (which is still playable in 2026), as well as the site for the 1996 movie Space Jam are the surface web. A lot of the surface web is made of up individual articles, which makes sense, since articles still make up a large amount of search engine results.      Like the surface of the ocean, the surface web is just a fraction of the internet as a whole. Back in 2017, some estimates claimed the surface web made up just 10% of the entire internet. That's still a huge number of websites, which tells you how big the overall web really is.What is the deep web?If the surface web is everything you can find via Google, the deep web is everything you can't. The deep web is much larger than the surface web, and is compromised of websites that are not readily accessible from search engines or direct URLs. They're often locked away behind authentication. That means you need at least a username and password to access them, and in many cases, they require an additional form of authentication as well. The article you're reading is on the surface web, but the software (content management system, or CMS) we use to write and publish the article is not—our CMS is still a website, but it's not something you can find in a Google search, and even if you knew the direct URL, you wouldn't have access. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's the same with the many sites you access that only you have permission to view. Think about something like Gmail: The service's homepage is accessible to everyone, and it's something that pops up when searching \"Gmail,\" but to access your Gmail inbox, you need to log in. Once you do, your inbox is accessible via the website, but it's not like anyone can see it with a URL, and they certainly can't find your inbox from a Google search. It's the same story with your Facebook feed, YouTube account, or your banking information. These are all accessible in your web browser as websites, but you need to log in to view them. That's also the case for services and subscriptions. Think about  stuff like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO: These are all accessible in your web browser, which means you're streaming the content on individual web pages. But the players on those web pages cannot be accessed from Google, even if the landing pages for a particular show or movie can be. In order to actually watch or listen to the content, you need to sign into your account. That's not the case with all streaming services, of course: Happy Gilmore on Tubi is a surface web page, since it's indexed on Google. Some of the deep web is also made up of pages you'll never see, such as protocols for identifying user accounts and running payments behind the scenes. It's not all paywalled content. What about the dark web?Maybe you've also heard about the dark web, but don't quite know what it is. As such, you might conflate the deep web and the dark web, but the two are not identical. In fact, the dark web is a part of the deep web; it's just the part you can't access with a traditional web browser. In order to access the dark web, you need a specialized browser, like Tor, and knowledge of the unique dark web URLs, which typically end in .onion instead of .com or .org.

While the gesture is timeless, the pricing certainly isn't: While you might think flowers are something you have to get fresh that day, waiting until Feb. 14 to buy that perfect bouquet means fewer options and higher prices. Here's the case for ordering your Valentine's flowers as soon as possible.Why you should order Valentine's Day flowers right nowThe sooner you order, the less likely you are to pay the top-dollar prices the last-minute shoppers will shoulder. As the big date approaches and inventory dwindles, prices skyrocket. A dozen roses that might cost $50 a week before Valentine's Day could easily jump to $90 or more come Feb. 14. \nEspecially if you're planning to have flowers delivered, early ordering is a must. Florists are absolutely slammed on Valentine's Day, and delivery slots fill up fast. Last-minute orders often can't be guaranteed for same-day delivery, meaning your romantic gesture might arrive a day late—which rather defeats the purpose. When you order early, you can schedule delivery for exactly when you want them to arrive, whether that's first thing in the morning to start your partner's day off right, or perfectly timed during the workday to make all their jealous coworkers. In short, Valentine's Day is about showing someone you care, and nothing shows you care like putting real thought and planning into your gesture. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to keep Valentine's Day flowers healthy until Valentine's DayThe good news: When properly cared for, roses can stay healthy for five to seven days after purchase. And for even more value and longevity, consider alternatives to traditional roses. Carnations and orchids are beautiful and tasteful while lasting up to two weeks. Not only will you be choosing something more economical, but also, you'll be showing your valentine that they're more special and unique than a boring old rose. (At least, you should be prepared with a little speech in case your lover actually really wanted roses.) To maximize the lifespan of your roses (and most bouquets):Keep them in clean water.Trim the stems at an angle every few days.Remove any leaves below the waterline.Store them away from direct sunlight and heat sources.Add flower food to the water.Remember, Valentine's Day is about expressing your feelings, not emptying your wallet. When you plan ahead, you have time to think about what your partner would really love. You can browse different options, read reviews, compare florists, and make a thoughtful choice rather than panic-buying whatever's available.

Users are urged to claim their rewards ASAP by clicking the included link, which is actually designed to harvest sensitive personal information. AT&T rewards scam phishes personal informationTargets for this scam have received texts containing a \"Rewards Expiration Notice\" urging them to redeem points in their AT&T account before they are scheduled to expire. The message includes a specific points balance and expiration date along with two \"recommended redemption methods\": AT&T Rewards Center: [shorturl link]AT&T Mobile App: Rewards sectionAs Malwarebytes discovered, the short link sends users to a https://att.hgfxp[.]cc/pay/, a spoofed website with AT&T branding, headers, menus, and links out to the real AT&T domain. Users are directed to enter their phone number to verify their account, which leads to a screen warning that their points are set to expire. Further down, you can see redemption options, including an Apple Watch Series 9, Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones, and Amazon gift cards. \nIn order to claim a reward and arrange delivery, victims are then prompted to enter more personal information—which is transmitted directly to the scammers. Malwarebytes notes that the forms have real-time validation and error highlighting so users are less likely to suspect the fraud. Rewards scam red flagsThis scam relies on social engineering tactics—like a sense of urgency and the fear of missing out—to trick targets into engaging. And while it does have a somewhat believable look and feel as well as a multi-step approach to build user trust, it also has some clear red flags. The text originates from a regular phone number rather than a short code, which is often used for automated messages, and the sender doesn't appear as a recognized AT&T contact. The thread also includes multiple recipients and a generic greeting. (A legitimate message from AT&T will be sent directly to you.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThen there's the shortened URL that leads to a website not owned by AT&T. While the page has some realistic branding and working links, it also has a number of typos and grammatical and formatting errors. Malwarebytes found that if you click the link on different days, the expiration date on the site changes. As always, don't click links in unsolicited texts. AT&T does have a rewards program, but you should go directly to that portal via the web or app to manage your rewards. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?There's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products, but, anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking. Perhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\nFirefox's AI features are easy to opt out ofOn Monday, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which drops Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in the between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any. \nWhat AI features Firefox offersFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.Alt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.AI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.Link previews: Shows key points before opening a link. AI chatbot in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.If you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle. Once activated, not only will these features not appear, but Firefox will block any pop-ups or alerts pushing you to try existing or future AI features. Any Firefox users who aren't keen on AI features will want to check out this new controls menu starting Feb. 24—though there are certainly more egregious AI features out there. Translations can be convenient, as can link previews. But I know I'd never want a chatbot in the sidebar of my browser. If I used Firefox as my main browser, I would definitely disable at least that feature, if not all of them. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This deal on a Eufy SoloCam E30 four-pack makes that math a little more palatable. It’s currently $299.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $549.99 price, which is the lowest price it's ever been, according to price-tracking tools. That brings each camera to about $75, which still isn’t cheap, of course—but unlike many other camera brands, these don't require a monthly subscription, which is a great perk.\nEach of these IP65-rated cameras runs on internal batteries that last about three months between charges, depending on how often motion is detected. Solar support helps extend that. Eufy says around two hours of direct sunlight per day is enough to keep them topped up. You can also hardwire the cameras if you want continuous recording, including short pre-roll clips, though the power cables are sold separately. You also get 360-degree pan and 70-degree tilt coverage per unit, which helps cut down on blind spots around driveways or yards. Video is captured in enhanced 2K resolution with an f/1.6 aperture, making nighttime footage via infrared night vision fairly crisp. There’s no built-in spotlight, so there's no color night vision here, but for general monitoring, black-and-white is often enough.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFootage can be stored locally on the included HomeBase S280, which has 16GB built in, or on a microSD card up to 128GB (sold separately) if you want more space. Smart home support includes Alexa and Google Assistant, but Apple HomeKit is not supported. Two-way audio is included, and the HomeBase can support up to 16 cameras, so expanding later is an option. This setup is not for people who want cloud storage or advanced smart home integrations. It makes more sense for those who want local control, predictable costs, and broad coverage without wiring the entire house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message. The healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text. Are you eligible for the Kaiser settlement? To qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to claim your settlement cashTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12. While the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's not your internet connection, and it isn't your OpenAI account: ChatGPT is down. According to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, users started reporting issues with ChatGPT at 11:56 a.m. ET. Those reports ballooned by 12:11 p.m., as the total number of incidents as of this article currently sits above 7,000. If you're an avid ChatGPT user, you might have also had issues with the bot yesterday: Downdetector shows over 25,000 reports of down time starting at 2:56 p.m. Tuesday and resolving around 4:11 p.m. the same day. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with all outages, OpenAI will likely figure out a patch for the issue soon enough. But these outages are becoming more common. There was the Verizon outage, of course, but other services like TikTok have also experienced intermittent periods of downtime. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Shortly thereafter, it kicked off an early access program allowing interested users to try it out free of charge. Unfortunately, that honeymoon period has come to an end: Alexa+ has now officially launched, and now you'll need to pay to access its most useful features.While certain features will still be free to use, the majority of the Alexa+ experience is now locked behind a paywall. True, you might already pay for that paywall—but if you don't, it's going to cost you quite a bit to keep the features you've been test driving for months. (Of course, the standard Alexa assistant still exists if you don't care for the latest generative AI enhancement.)What is Alexa+?The new Alexa is much like the old one, but now behaves a bit more like other generative AI assistants, including ChatGPT. In addition to simple requests and questions, Alexa+ can handle more complex queries and understand context (meaning one complex question can be followed by another, without needing to repeat yourself). For all the hullabaloo around generative AI, contextual awareness is really one of the big improvements users will notice with their digital assistants.    \nAmazon has a big vision for Alexa+. It still wants you to use it to control smart home devices, run timers, check the weather, and catch up on the news, but it also wants users to take advantage of \"agentic\" tasks, or actions that the AI can handle on your behalf. In theory, agentic AI allows you to ask the AI to order dinner to-go, make reservations at restaurants, schedule an Uber, or book a home repair. I'm still not sold on the capabilities of agentic AI assistants, and I imagine most people will continue to use Alexa+ the way they used regular old Alexa, (e.g. asking \"Is it cold today?\" or telling it to \"set a timer for 10 minutes,\" or ordering it to \"Play 'Manchild' by Sabrina Carpenter on repeat\"), but what do I know? Maybe Alexa+ really will change the way people interact with their Echo devices.How much Alexa+ will cost youIf you're interested in Amazon's newest AI assistant, there are three different ways to try it—one free, and two paid. How to use Alexa+ for freeThe most basic, Alexa+ chat, is totally free of charge. You can try it by heading to alexa.com or using the Alexa app for iOS or Android, where you can talk to Alexa in a chat window, ala ChatGPT. Amazon says users can get \"quick answers, plan research, and explore new topics.\" But the thing is, you can't use Alexa+ chat for any of the things you probably want to have Alexa+ do. It is solely a web-based chatbot experience, not something you can connect to your Alexa-enabled devices. If you're interested in the full Alexa+ package, you'll need to pay Amazon one way or another. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPrime Members get a free subscriptionThe good news is, you might have already paid Amazon for the privilege, even if you didn't realize it: Currently, Amazon is offering all Prime members full access to Alexa+, including via the chatbot and through Alexa-enabled devices. Alexa+ also works with other Amazon services that come free with Prime, including Prime Video and Amazon Music. Seeing as over half the U.S. population has a Prime account, chances are good that if you're at all interested, you already have access to Alexa+. How to use Alexa+ without PrimeMaybe you're one of the rare unicorns who doesn't have a Prime account, but still wants to try Alexa+ on an Echo smart speaker. In that case, Amazon will offer you the full experience for a cool $19.99/month. That's a slightly ridiculous price, seeing as a full Prime membership (with all the added benefits, from Prime Video to free shipping) will run you $14.99/month (or $139 per year). You definitely save money by subscribing to the latter, which is probably a big part of Amazon's motivation here—Jeff Bezos will never truly rest until everyone uses Amazon to buy everything.How to enable Alexa+If you opt for either of the paid options, you can set up Alexa+ by simply telling your Alexa-enabled device, \"Upgrade to Alexa+.\" You can also use Alexa+ by logging into your Amazon account on alexa.com. And as noted above, you can certainly opt to keep the old Alexa assistant for the time being, whether whether you have Prime or not. While Amazon may do away with the legacy assistant in the future, it isn't forcing anyone to switch just yet.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

For the second time in two years, the streaming service is raising prices, this time across all of its plans, including the entry-level Fan Tier. This comes shortly after the company discontinued its free, ad-supported tier on Dec. 31.The new tiers and their pricing will be as follows:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Fan Tier will go up from $7.99/month to $9.99/month. This tier offers basic access to the full Crunchyroll library, and the ability to download shows to a single device for offline viewing.The Mega Fan tier will go up from $11.99/month to $13.99/month. At this tier, you can stream on up to four devices at once, download content in HD for offline viewing, and get access to the Crunchyroll Game Vault.The Ultimate Fan Tier will go up from $15.99/month to $17.99/month. This tier adds access to Crunchyroll Manga, streaming on up to six devices at once, and a swag bag after you've been subscribed to this plan for a year. The new pricing will kick in on your first billing date after March 4. If you're not already subscribed, however, there's still a little bit of time to sign up and get the (slightly) lower price for your first month. While existing users can't lock in the lower price, Crunchyroll is offering a limited-time upgrade to an annual plan for the Fan Tier for $66.99/year, which comes out to $5.58/month. If you're confident you're still going to be subject to your anime addiction a year from now, this is going to be your best way to save money in the long run.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The news was first highlighted by AppleInsider and involves warnings that look suspiciously like official Apple messaging. While AppleInsider's report doesn't link to any specific user complaints of this happening, it does include example screenshots, and reports matching AppleInsider's description have popped up on both Reddit and Apple's official support forums over the last 30 days.The scam might come over either email or text, and usually warns the recipient about a potentially fraudulent purchase made using their Apple Pay at a physical Apple Store, while offering a phone number or email to contact to address the issue. According to AppleInsider, it might also include a case ID, timestamp, or other technical details in order to appear more legitimate. One user on Reddit, for instance, considered that the scam might be a legitimate text from Apple because it included the official sounding phrase \"If this was you, no action is needed.\"However, inconsistencies remain, such as the scam often referring to Apple Accounts as Apple IDs, a now outdated term. Additionally, while emails might use official looking letterhead that makes them appear to come straight from Apple, mistakes could remain. For instance, an email could open with \"Hello {Name}\" instead of being addressed to the recipient's actual name. It could come from a bogus address, but even appearing to come from a legitimate source like \"[email protected]\" isn't a strong indicator that it's real, as it's possible for scammers to spoof email addresses. Overall, the idea seems to be to speed the recipient into action with an urgent tone, while using Apple's logo and a professional writing style to mask any clues as to who is really sending these notices.\nHow to tell if that Apple Pay text or email is actually a scam If you are receiving any texts or emails about your Apple Pay activity at all, chances are they probably aren't real—Apple doesn't reach out to its users in this way. Rather than sending texts or emails, communication instead comes directly from the Wallet app. Additionally, Apple Pay serves as a medium for payment rather than as a credit or debit account in and of itself. As such, if any fraudulent transactions are detected, notices would come from your bank or credit card provider rather than Apple itself.Still, it is worth keeping an eye out for any red flags as well. Look for small typos or unusual domain names, which can help give a fake message away, even if a lack of these isn't an indicator that a message is legitimate. Also, rather than calling any provided phone numbers, consider searching for them online to see whether they've been reported as being tied to a scam operation. At any rate, do not respond to these notices, and don't provide any information (such as passwords, which Apple will never ask for) to them if you've already reached out by accident. There are better ways to verify your Apple Pay activity.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat to do if you think you're being scammedIf you think a message you've received is illegitimate, the best thing you can do is ignore it and verify it independently. Instead of responding to the suspicious text or email directly, or calling any provided phone numbers, double check any claims made in the statement through official Apple channels. You can see your recent Apple Pay purchases in the Wallet app by tapping on one of your registered cards, and opening the Settings app and navigating to Media & Purchases > View Account > Purchase History will show you any recent App Store purchases. If you don't see a transaction mentioned in one of these notices in your official payment history, chance are it never happened.If you're still in doubt you have options. Rather than reaching out to an email or phone number linked in a potential scam notice, start fresh with a new message straight to Apple's official support. You can find the proper contact details, including an official Apple phone number for your region, on Apple's website. The company will be able to determine whether it's seen any suspicious activity tied to your account.Finally, once you're certain a message is part of a scam, you can forward it (or simply report it, if forwarding isn't possible) to Apple to help the company shut it down. The specific email address you'll want to use will differ based on the type of message, and you can find all your options on Apple's support website, under \"How to report suspicious emails, messages, and calls.\" Once you've sent the message to the correct channels, delete it from your inbox to keep yourself from accidentally clicking any compromised links. As added security, also consider changing your Apple Account password, or using a password manager.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

It has a longer battery life and tiny tweaks that make a big difference, like a brighter screen, greater durability, and new software features. Right now, the Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS 42mm) is down 25% to $299 (originally $399), marking its lowest price ever on Amazon. \nIn PCMag's real-world testing, the watch delivered nearly two days of battery life and features a brighter screen with 2,000 nits of peak brightness.

It features Apple’s newest and smartest software, watchOS 26, which includes features such as Sleep Score metrics and enhanced safety alerts like life-saving hypertension notifications.Unlike the Apple Watch SE 3, for just $50 more at the current discount, the Series 11 has a thinner design with a larger display, and sensors that detect blood oxygen levels and ECGs, as well as other heart health and temperature sensors. The 11 also packs in an altimeter, gyroscope, compass, and ambient light sensor. Users can dive into their workout data via the iOS Fitness app, while the iOS Health app houses biometrics and ECG results. This model includes GPS, enabling real-time tracking of distance and pace during outdoor workouts.

Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension. Now, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.How to switch over to a Google accountFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:Open the Fitbit app.Sign in to your Fitbit account.Tap Settings and select Move account.Follow the on-screen instructions.During the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.It's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.What this means for youFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.There also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.Despite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Presidents Day falls on the third Monday of February each year, which means this year, it will take place on Feb. 16, 2026. Presidents Day sales, then, are usually concentrated on the weekend before the holiday, which means that this year, you're likely to see the biggest discounts from Feb. 13–16—and I wouldn't be surprised if some retailers start their sales even earlier.Presidents Day sales generally bring big discounts to items like home furnishings and mattresses, as well as major appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, and you can expect the same this year. As we're getting close to the end of winter, you'll likely also see price drops on winter gear like snow blowers, space heathers, and power generators, plus cold weather clothing like coats, as retailers try to sell down their inventory and make room for next season's items. You'll likely see some tech deals as well, as older model TVs and laptops will see price cuts to make room for newer models (some of which likely debuted at January's CES show). If you're planning to shop in one of these categories, start paying attention to prices now, so you'll be able to spot good discounts come the holiday weekend.What items aren't worth buying during Presidents Day sales?Seasons come and go, and even as retailers push their winter inventory out, they will try to sell you their spring products. You should hold off on picking these items up for now, as you'll likely be paying a premium price—even items that are \"marked down\" are likely to see bigger price cuts later, if you can wait.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWho will be holding Presidents Day sales?All major retailers will be having a Presidents Day sale, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others. The sales will generally be available both online and in-person (except at Amazon, of course).Should you wait for Amazon's Big Spring Sale? Presidents Day is a time-honored tradition, but in recent years, the biggest sale of the early part of the year has been Amazon's Big Spring Sale (with other retailers planning their own sales events around the same time). While we don't know the exact dates, its likely this year's will take place around the same time as last year—in mid- to late March. Is it worth waiting to shop until then? It depends on what you want to buy.The online retailer debuted the Big Spring Sale in 2024 with many sales on many different categories, but especially on tech, so if you're eyeing a specific tech product but haven't found a great deal yet, it's worth waiting to see if it is discounted in a month or so. However, if you're shopping for winter gear, mattresses, furniture, or large appliances, you'll likely see better discounts during Presidents Day sales.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

But what if you actually used the right ctrl key? Or what if you prefer Claude or ChatGPT to Copilot? Whatever your reason for not loving the Copilot key, don't worry—you can change it. Here's how to do so in the Windows settings or, if necessary, using Microsoft Powertoys.How to change the Copilot key in settingsOpen the Settings application and head to the Personalization section. You should find a Customize Copilot key option here, assuming you're using a recent-ish version of Windows 11. Click the drop-down menu and you'll have three options: Copilot, Search, and Custom. You can change the button to Search if you'd rather use the key to bring up the Windows search tool instead of Copilot.Alternatively, you can use the Custom option to launch any application on your computer instead of Copilot. This could be a useful way to open the Claude or ChatGPT desktop apps instead of Copilot. Or, if you're not a big AI fan, you could just have it open your browser.\nThis is a limited number of options, granted, but it's easy and doesn't require any sort of tools. It's your simplest option.How to change the Copilot key using Microsoft PowertoysYou may have noticed that the options in Settings don't let you remap the Copilot key to the ctrl key, or any other key—all you can do is launch an application. For that, you're going to need to install Powertoys, the secret Microsoft app that improves Windows.After installing, go to the Keyboard Manager section. The simplest thing to do, which may or may not work on your computer, is to click Remap keys. You should be able to press your Copilot key to remap it (it will show up as F23, which we'll get to). Now you can choose what you want the key to serve as. This could be ctrl, if you like, or it could be any other key. Click OK, and you should be done.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThere's a chance this won't work for you. Why? Because the Copilot key works a little differently depending on what kind of laptop you have. Buckle up: This gets complicated in a very Microsoft-y way.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn many computers, the Copilot key functions as an F23 key. This is a workaround, of sorts, allowing Microsoft to add a key without changing the operating system very much. Most modern keyboards only have one row of function keys—around 12 in total. Keyboards in the 80's and 90's sometimes had two rows of keys—around 24 in total. Windows, to this day, still supports all 24 keys, even though basically no one has that many function keys. Microsoft took advantage of this—on many laptops the Copilot key functions as an F23 key.But this is Windows, so of course it's more complicated than that. On some laptops, pressing the Copilot key triggers a keyboard shortcut: Windows-Shift-F23. This means you can't use the Remap keys function in Powertoys to remap the Copilot key, because the Copilot key already triggers a keyboard shortcut.What you can do is use the Remap a shortcut option. Use this, then press the Copilot key as your selection. You should see the keyboard shortcut Windows-Shift-F23 show up. Now choose what you want to remap your Copilot key to.This works, with a caveat: You really can't use it to bring back your ctrl key, as users have noted on Github. The issue is that you can't remap a keyboard shortcut to a modifier key, just to a single keypress. It's not clear what could fix this, and I suspect users of such laptops are just stuck. Which is all to say that you might not be able to get your control key back, but least you can remap the key to do something else.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.Performing this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.Unfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"Well, dang. I've reached out to Google for additional comment, but it seems the eye of Sauron is upon us. Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying. One user said it's now been re-enabled on Brave, and I can confirm that I'm able to access it on Safari with my iPhone using the Vinegar extension.It's unclear how long these efforts will remain operational, but at least we've now been able to diagnose a cause. Free YouTube background play didn't break on accident, and that means developers and users will have to be extra crafty to keep the hack alive in the future. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        It's Christmas time, and people believe a lot of inaccurate things about the holiday, so for the next few weeks, I'm going to take a look at the truth behind Christmas mythology, starting with the biggest misconception of them all: Not \"how can the North Pole support an industrial infrastructure large enough to build toys for all the world's children,\" but whether Jesus was really born on Dec. 25.  Was Jesus born on Dec. 25?Most Christians celebrate the Baby J's birthday on Dec. 25, but he probably wasn't born on that day. The Bible doesn't provide a specific date, neither does any historical document, and early Christians didn't even celebrate Christmas. So Jesus could have been born on Dec. 25, but he could have been born on March 7, or any other date. Here are some popular alternatives for Jesus' birthday:January 6 or 7—favored by  Orthodox ChristiansNovember 18—according to Clement of AlexandriaMarch or April—based on Biblical passages describing shepherds watching their flocks.September or October—based on John the Baptist's father's membership in \"The Order of Abijah.\" This theory is too complex to explain here, but it's fascinating, and I urge you to fall into the priestly division of Abijah rabbit hole like I did. If Jesus wasn't born on Dec. 25, why is it Christmas?No one knows for sure why we have mostly landed on Dec. 25 as Jesus' birthday, but there are theories. Here are two of the most common:\nSolar Theory: The first solid reference to Jesus being born on Dec. 25 was in the Calendar of Filocalus, a Roman almanac written in 354. The calendar denotes Dec. 25 as both Christ's birth date and the date of an older holiday, \"The Birthday of the Unconquered Sun,\" suggesting both holidays were celebrated on the same day in Rome (or were at least listed that way by the 4th century). The theory is that Romans were like \"we celebrate the day anyway\" and early Christians were all \"we got your unconquered sun right here\" and accepted the 25th to celebrate, eventually outlasting the Romans and leaving the pagan holiday a footnote that no one celebrates besides my friend Gary.Calculation Theory: Early Christians believed that prophets and martyrs died on the same day they were conceived—I assume a second-century skeptic carved a scathing tablet debunking this, but it's what many early Christians believed. Jesus' martyrdom/conception was said to have happened on March 25, so his birth would be on Dec. 25 (assuming he was punctual.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are other theories—the date was chosen to coincide with Hannukah, Saturnalia, the re-dedication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, or the Eagles/Bears game in 2006. The point is we don't actually know, but it's probably a \"little from column A, a little from column B\" situation. The Calculation Theory provided a theological justification for the date, and the Solar symbolism provided cultural relevance; both Jesus and Santa like when we work together, after all. What is the true meaning of Christmas?Ultimately, the murkiness around Jesus' exact birthday isn't important. Christmas doesn't exist because a Roman bureaucrat wrote it on a calendar or some pagans wanted to blow off steam. Whether you celebrate Christmas as the birthday of Christ or a mid-winter celebration of light, the holiday's meaning was been built collectively over centuries, and is molded and changed constantly to fit the needs and desires of the people who celebrate it. Whether that celebration is a somber religious expression or listening to Mariah Carey while drinking eggnog, it's all good. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Simply called YouTube Recap, this feature will break down your watching habits across all categories in 2025.According to YouTube, YouTube Recap will show \"a set of up to 12 different cards,\" with spotlights on \"your top channels, interests, and even the evolution of your viewing habits.\" It'll draw its data from both long-form and short-form videos as well as downloaded videos, but it'll only track videos you watched while signed in to your account.The company is also dividing its viewers into \"personality types\" based on what they watch, such as \"the Trailblazer\" or \"the Skill Builder.\" There's a whole breakdown of what these mean over on a support page, but as an example, if you're a \"Sunshiner,\" that means \"You're drawn to content that spreads positivity and good vibes.\" Google says that the most common personality types this year were \"the Sunshiner,\" \"the Wonder Seeker,\" and \"the Connector,\" and that personalities like \"the Philosopher\" and \"the Dreamer\" were more rare. So I guess you can brag about that if you get one of those.\nIf you listen to a lot of music on YouTube, meanwhile, YouTube Recap will also pull some data from YouTube Music, and can show you your top artists and songs of the year. For more detail, you'll need to visit the YouTube Music app and look at your YouTube Music recap proper.YouTube Recap should be available in North America starting today, although it might take some time until you see it—I can't seem to access mine yet. For global viewers, YouTube says it will \"roll out to the rest of the world this week.\" You'll be able to view it in 17 languages, with a full list available here.I'll keep checking for mine throughout the day, but for now, here's how to find your YouTube Recap once it goes live.How to view your YouTube RecapAccording to YouTube's instructions, YouTube Recap is available on both desktop and in the mobile app, and will show up as a banner either on your homepage or in your \"You\" tab. \nOn mobile, you can get to your \"You\" tab by tapping the button in the bottom-right corner with your profile picture on it, while on desktop, you'll need to click the \"You\" subheading in the pane on the left-hand side of your screen. Or, you can just navigate to youtube.com/recap and let your browser do the work for you (if on mobile, it'll direct you to the appropriate section of the app). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNote that you'll need to be signed in for any of this to work. You might also need to update your YouTube app if you're still having trouble. Google says you need version 18.43 or newer to see your Recap.Once you've viewed your recap, you'll also be able to share it, by tapping or clicking the Share button in any of your recap cards. Or, you can save it by tapping the download button to the left of the Share button.YouTube's most popular topics and creators in 2025\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: YouTube\n                    \n    \nAlongside YouTube Recap, YouTube has also released a more general look at trending topics, creators, and songs in 2025. The most popular topic in 2025 was apparently Squid Game, while MrBeast was the top creator (I have a feeling those might be connected). The Joe Rogan Experience is at the top of the podcast list, and interestingly, there are separate trending lists for shorts and full-length videos, with Forrest Frank's YOUR WAY'S BETTER topping Shorts and Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With a Smile taking the crown for full-length videos. KPop Demon Hunters is the only topic where you'll see overlap between the Shorts and full-length lists, with Soda Pop appearing on both.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We had new albums from Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Tyler the Creator, and, of course, Huntrix (of KPop Demon Hunters fame), just to name a few. You may have listened to any number of new albums that came out this year, mixed in with music that released any time over the last century. You might not even remember what you were listening to back in January. But Apple Music remembers, and will serve in up to you in your 2025 Apple Music Replay. Like last year, your Replay is available in your Apple Music app. If you're relatively new to the streaming service, that might sound obvious—especially if you've previously used a service like Spotify that offers a similar annual wrap-up. But this wasn't always the case: For much of Apple Music Replay's brief history, you had to visit a separate website, music.apple.com/us/replay, and log into your Apple Music account in order to access your recap. It seemed silly, considering Spotify Wrapped is very much an in-app experience, but it took Apple until 2024 to get with the program.That said, it seems Apple has made additional improvements this year. In 2024, the experience was essentially contained in an in-app browser, where it loaded your Apple Music Replay with the same UI as the website. This year, Replay is a native function of the Apple Music app, at least on iOS. \nHow to access your 2025 Apple Music Replay \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can still access your Replay from the official website, but the easiest way to review it is from the app on your iPhone or iPad. Open the app on your device of choice. Make your way to the Home tab if the app doesn't open there automatically, then tap or click on the large Replay option, which should appear at the top left. (This option also shows up in the Music app for Mac, but it will automatically direct you to the website in your browser.) Whichever way you access it, you'll be able to see all of your Replay months here (excluding December, of course, since the month just started), but let's focus on 2025 as a whole.Unpacking your Apple Music ReplayAt the top, you'll find a Replay your year in music tile. Tap Play Your Highlight Reel and Apple Music will walk you through your year. Here's what you can expect, at least based on my results: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you'll see your total listening minutes, complete with both a collage of the albums you listened to most, and one of your top-played songs playing in the background. Next, you'll see your top artist of the year, with a collage of their images and a relevant song playing in the background. The following slide is a breakdown of your top artist by monthThe next will show if any artist was your number one for multiple months. Next, you'll see the number of songs you listened to, complete with your top song of the year. Then you'll see the number of albums you listened to, and which one was your top choice. Second to last, Apple Music tells you your top genres of the year, including the one you listened to mostOne final slide summarizes the whole year.You don't have to watch the highlight reel to see these stats: Once out of the reel, you can scroll through the Replay page to see everything covered in the slides, plus additional stats. Mine shows top artists, songs, and albums by month—so I can see which artist defined March (Will Stratton), which song I listened to most in August  (\"The Subway\" by Chappel Roan), and which album I played on repeat in May (\"Tunnel Vision\" by Beach Bunny). I also see top playlists of the year; different listening milestones, like Minutes Listened, Artists Played, and Songs Played; stats from last year's Replay; and a playlist of my top songs of the year. Many of these stats, both in and out of the highlight reel, are easily sharable. You'll see a share icon next to any stat you can export, which makes it simple to share fun graphics with friends or on social media. I've already blown up the group chat with some of my stats here, and I expect many of you to do the same. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In the past, I've hyped up the beloved Dyson Airwrap, but recently, I've actually been using the Shark FlexStyle instead. Forget the Dyson hype—this thing is fantastic, and right now, it's also a lot cheaper. The Shark FlexStyle is still on sale for Cyber Week, knocked down to $200 from the usual $350. If you're looking for a tool that can do it all but you don't have an unlimited budget, this might be the one for you, and it won't even feel like a compromise. The Shark FlexStyle is a steal right nowRight now, you can get the FlexStyle, which is essentially a large wand that shoots air out of five different attachments, for $199.99 instead of $349.99, its lowest price ever according to price trackers. For comparison, the base model of Dyson's Airwrap is also on sale—for $500. In short, this is the best deal you're going to get on an airstyler, and this one is also perfectly comparable to pricier models and brands.\nHere's what you get with the FlexStyle: Two 1.25\" curling barrels (one clockwise and the other counterclockwise); an oval brush attachment; a paddle brush attachment; and, a hair dryer attachment. It also has four heat and three airflow settings, plus a unique feature that allows you to rotate the top half, so the device forms a right angle (like a traditional blow dryer) or remains straight (like a standard curling iron). Why I love the FlexStyle (even compared to my Dyson)A few weeks ago, my Airwrap went on the fritz. I haven't had a chance to bring it in to be serviced yet, but it's four years old and was already a refurbished model when I got it, so its time may have come. The thing about this machine is that its time seems to come frequently: At Thanksgiving, I was bemoaning my Airwrap's fate and two other women at the table piped up to say they're dealing with the same thing—theirs too just aren't functioning properly anymore. Given the top-of-the-line version is $750, replacing mine wasn't in the cards.Instead, I decided to give the FlexStyle a shot, and it has been at work in my apartment for the past week. Surprisingly, I found it works exactly like my Airwrap, save for a few key differences. First, it's more powerful than my four-year-old Dyson, though to be fair I can't exactly compare it to a brand-new model. Second, the rotating head make the process of drying my hair a lot faster—the first night, I did standard ringlet curls with the 1.25\" barrels but did not set them, hoping to see how they held up all on their own. They maintained their original shape for about a day, which is more mileage than I was getting out of my Airwrap and better than I expected for curls I did not set. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nSince then, I've tested the different attachments. I used the round brush for a traditional blowout that stayed frizz-free for over a day (granted, with help from products like Color Wow and K18), and I curled the ends of my hair under with the barrels and then set them for hold and volume. This is where I was truly impressed: The swiveling top made that style significantly easier to achieve than I'm used to with the Dyson. I am happily on day two of that style, with no issues to report. A cheaper but worthy Dyson alternativeIn my opinion, you do not need to pay $750 for an airstyler. You do not even need to pay $500. And with the current deal on the FlexStyle, you do not even need to pay $350. This thing works well, produces styles that can last (though you still have to use products and set the curls, since it's not running on magic and wishes), and is lightweight and simple to use. Consider it highly recommended. What stores have the best sales on Cyber Week?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Week shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through and beyond Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Week deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Week still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Week deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

I grew out of using my iPhone and Mac to read ebooks a few years ago, but I waited until this year to finally grab the e-reader I'd been eyeing since 2020. It's the Kindle Paperwhite, which I bought on discount a few months ago. I love it, which is why I'm happy to report that it's now on sale for Cyber Monday and is down to its lowest ever price.I know what you might be about to say, but buying a Kindle doesn't mean that you're forced to opt into Amazon's ebook ecosystem. I've successfully de-Amazoned my Kindle, and it's been going fine so far. You have lots of Amazon alternatives to buy ebooks, and I've made the most of the opportunity to read many of the DRM-free ebooks purchased over the years. The Kindle Paperwhite itself is a great device, too. It's quite snappy and doesn't show any performance issues even if you turn a lot of pages back-to-back.It's water-resistant, which means that you can use it by the pool, beach, or even while doing the dishes. And yes, there was a time when I got so locked into a book that I actually was reading the series even while doing the dishes. It was a bit annoying to stop and turn the page every minute or so, but the point is that I never worried about causing any water damage to my Kindle Paperwhite.Yes, there is a cheaper Kindle, too, but it lacks water resistance and has about half the battery life of a Paperwhite, which makes it less appealing to me. If you can afford to do so, I think buying the Kindle Paperwhite is the smart choice. But there still are a few more decisions to factor in. One is the color. The Paperwhite is available in black, green, and pink colors and all are currently at their lowest ever price. Once you've figured out your color, you need to choose if you're buying your Kindle with ads or ad-free. I always recommend spending the extra 20 bucks to get the ad-free version, but if lock screen ads don't bother you, then you can get the lower priced model.The third and final choice is whether you want to stretch your budget for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. This variant has 32GB of built-in storage (double that of the regular Paperwhite), an auto-adjusting front light, and support for wireless charging. It's just $5 more than the ad-free Kindle Paperwhite at time of writing, and it's worth remembering that this variant also doesn't have ads. Personally, I think the choice is really between an ad-supported Paperwhite at $125 or an ad-free Paperwhite Signature Edition at $150. Both are great devices, so no matter what, you can't really go wrong.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

I've rounded up the best tech deals you can find right now and will continue to do so throughout the sale.The best earphones and headphones on sale for Cyber MondayThe new 2nd Gen. Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds came out this August, and are great earbuds (I'm wearing them as I write this). They're one of the best earbuds of 2025, and they're $50 off.

Not bad for a QLED.The best deal on Cyber Monday tabletsFor those with a little more budget and looking for better features and specs for a better budget tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11\" Tablet is Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11\" Tablet is $199.99 (originally $269.99).The best portable speakers deals for Cyber MondayThe JBL Charge 6 is a powerful yet portable speaker that came out this year. Its sound is powerful enough to completely fill up a big room with a full sound and maintain its sound quality while doing so. You can get it for $129.99 (originally $199.99).If you want a smaller and cheaper speaker, the JBL Flip 7 is $109.99 (originally $149.99). However, if you can spare the $20, the Charge 6 offers a better value.There are good deals on laptops. With some powerful ones starting in the $400s, your money will go a longer way if you get something with at least 16GB of RAM and at least an Intel or Ryzen 5 processor. One example is the HP Essential 255 G10, with a Ryzen 5 processor and 16GB of RAM for $459 (originally $918).If you can spare close to another $100, the HP 255 G10 is with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, is $568.99 (originally $1,137.99). An incredible value for your money. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat other sales will Target have for Cyber Monday?Target says it will have week-long deals every Sunday through Dec. 24.

But yes, at the moment, you can still get the game and system for $449 (down from $499) at Walmart (Amazon's stock is completely out)—the lowest price it has reached yet, according to price tracking tools. (Note that you can only see the price once you've signed in and it's in your cart, as Nintendo restricts retailers from promoting anything below the \"minimum advertised price\" of $499.) With Christmas on the way, this deal is likely to sell out fast, so I'd advise ordering it sooner rather than later if you're considering it. \nTo put into perspective how good this deal is, the OLED edition of the original Nintendo Switch is $400 right now, meaning you can get the new system and a great game for only $50 more—and the Switch 2 is an upgrade in every way, according to Lifehacker's review. You can play your old Switch games on the Switch 2, since it's backwards compatible. The ergonomics and design have improved, making it much better to hold and look at. The battery life has also improved, now with about 180 minutes of handheld playtime before the juice runs out. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe biggest thing to consider when deciding whether you should buy a Switch 2 right now is that the library is currently on the smaller side, with few absolute must-play titles yet released (and the ones that are out may cost more, going up to $80). But being able to play your older games does make the transition easier,  especially considering some games, like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, will look better on the Switch 2. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

If you are a runner, I know what you should tell your mom you want for Christmas. And even if there isn’t a gifting holiday in your immediate future, you should still know the Good News about water-resistant running shoes. They’re out there, they might be on sale right now, and they will change your life if you run in snowy conditions—or if you would if you had the right shoes.\nAs a lifelong on-and-off runner, I will say that running in the spring is a lot more fun if you don't have a long off-season every winter. So rather than from starting from scratch every year, it pays to keep putting in the miles through the cold and the rain and the snow. Maybe you don't run quite as often, and maybe you spend a little more time on the treadmill, but don't completely give up. I've written before about what to wear to run in the cold, focusing on things like jackets, gloves, and layering pieces. But I used to always forget about shoes. Whether it's snowy in your area or just rainy, keeping your feet warm and dry is a game-changer. \nAround this time last year,  my birthday was coming up and I had no idea what to tell my mom I wanted. (She kept asking.) I was giving the matter some thought while I was jogging at the local track, in a drizzling near-freezing rain, and my toes were going squish with every step. I suddenly remembered that Gore-Tex shoes exist. I had owned a pair years ago and loved them, but never replaced them when they wore out. They felt like too much of a luxury somehow. Most runners get through wet weather in regular shoes and wool socks, so why not make do?I’ll tell you why not: Wool socks can keep your feet warm, but they don’t keep them dry. If you’ve traveled to a park to get your run in, you’re driving home with soaking wet feet. You’ll come home, wring out your socks, and have to air out your shoes and hope they’re mostly dry by the time you go for your next run. Putting on wet shoes is about as much fun as putting on a wet bathing suit. Returning home from a drizzly run with dry feet is, by contrast, one of this cruel world’s great creature comforts. What weather are water-resistant shoes good for?Water-resistant shoes are great in drizzling rain, or in snowy conditions. In regular shoes, your body heat tends to melt any snow that contacts your shoes, making your feet wet even on a below-freezing day. Water-resistant shoes are great for when it’s snowing, when there’s a small amount of snow on the ground, or when it’s raining. This covers pretty much all of the weather I’m likely to consider running-friendly in a Pennsylvania winter.What don’t water-resistant shoes do?Water-resistant is not waterproof, though. In Gore-Tex and similar materials, you cannot step into an ankle-deep puddle and expect to stay dry. A heavy enough downpour will probably eventually work its way through or around the material. Note that water-resistant shoe material doesn’t stop snow or rain from getting into the top of the shoe. For trudging through deep snow, you probably want to attach a gaiter (or buy a shoe that comes with built-in gaiters). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd if you run in a variety of wintry conditions, you may want more traction on the bottom of the shoe as well. You can buy shoes with spikes built in, or add your own.  What are the best water-resistant running shoes?I know you’re dying to see mine, so here they are: the Nike InfinityRN Gore-Tex. (Mine are white.) I've only put about 200 miles on them since last year, since I wear other shoes in dry weather. That means that they're still in good condition to last another year.  \nBased on reviews, forum posts, and other things I’ve heard runners say about their favorite weatherproof shoes, I’ve collected some other excellent models to consider. For each, I’m linking one model, but click around to see its other colors, sizes, and men’s/women’s versions.Nike Pegasus Trail 5 Gore-TexSaucony Peregrine Ice+3 Hoka Clifton 9 GTX TSPuma Deviate Nitro 3 WinterizedBrooks Ghost 16 GTX\nNote that Gore-Tex is a name brand of breathable, water-resistant fabric, but other brands exist (for example, Saucony has their own, which they call Runshield). Gore-Tex is often abbreviated “GTX” in shoe model names, so consider looking for that when searching for shoes. And a bonus on many of these shoes is that they include high-traction outsoles to reduce the chances of slipping on wet surfaces. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Both are $100 off. The sale began a few days ago for Black Friday, and is still available today on Cyber Monday. I've used and reviewed the Forerunner 570, and found it a step up from the earlier Forerunner 265 (which I also loved). The 570 adds a microphone and two different types of voice assistants, plus some new software features like heat acclimation and the ability to trim your activity if you didn't press \"stop\" when you crossed the race finish line. My only complaint is (or was) that the price seemed a bit steep in comparison to the previous model. But with the current deal, it's a lot closer to the original price of the 265: The 570 is now going for $449.99.\nThe Forerunner 970 is also $100 off, which brings its current price to $649.99. The biggest thing the 970 has going for it over the 570 is that it can show you maps while you run. Both watches can do breadcrumb tracking (drawing a line showing where you've been), but with a fully map-enabled watch, you can see important details like where your hiking route crosses roads or turns along them. The 970 also has an LED flashlight, which is incredibly handy for getting around in the dark—whether that means snuggling into your sleeping bag at a campsite or just sneaking out of your kid's room at bedtime.\nWhat stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

If you're like me and are fed up with waiting for one of the two rowing machines to open up at the gym, you need an at-home rowing machine. After a few months of testing the new Hydrow Arc Rowing Machine—which I reviewed in-depth—I trust Hydrow as a brand name. Right now, the Hydrow Origin Rowing Machine is available for $1,645 on Amazon after Cyber Monday, a 25% discount off its list price of $2,195.\nThe Hydrow Origin is the company's original model, but don't confuse \"original\" for \"bare-bones.\" This machine still has a 22-inch screen and plenty of streaming content, which is where the real value lies. I've found these how-to videos and wide-ranging workouts are what make Hydrow such a great workout (much like how Peloton is so much more than just its bikes). Compared to a more basic rowing machine you might be used to at the gym, Hydrow machines have electromagnetic drag technology that really do mimic the feeling of rowing on water. And at today's $550 off, it's never been a better time to buy.If you're still shopping around, I recommend checking out guides like our live blog, where we use price trackers to make sure you're really getting the best deals this Black Friday. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The Wonderboom is their smaller, more portable version. The Wonderboom 4 released last summer, and dropped in price 40% during Cyber Monday, but you can still get it for $59.99 (originally $99.99) right now. This is the lowest price it has reached according to price-tracking tools, and it's cheaper than the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 3.\nThe Wonderboom 4 is a slight improvement on an already good portable rugged speaker, the Wonderboom 3. It is small enough to fit in most people's hands, and it is rated IP67 for water- and dust-proofing. The 14-hour battery life completes the trifecta of what you expect on a decent portable speaker. This new version comes with USB-C for faster charging, and a Podcast mode, which tweaks the EQ to suit spoken vocals. Unfortunately, there is no full EQ customization or support with the Ultimate Ears app.The sound is where most Ultimate Ears speakers shine, using their 360-degree sound, great for group listening. Like the Podcast mode, there is also an Outdoor mode which makes the EQ sound better at higher volumes so you can listen to it outdoors in noisy environments. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs an outdoor speaker or for someone who likes to listen to podcasts or audiobooks at home without headphones, the Wonderboom 4 is great, especially at its current $59.99 price. There aren't many outdoor speakers at this price tag that can compete with it, other than the JBL Clip 5, which is currently at the same price.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

That’s a significant drop for one of Google’s latest flagship phones. \nWhile the much-hyped AI features don’t quite live up to expectations, the refined hardware and returning core strengths still make this a compelling upgrade for Android users. As Lifehacker’s Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt notes in her review, Pixelsnap—Google’s new magnetic charging and accessory system—adds real day-to-day convenience, especially if you’ve ever admired Apple’s MagSafe ecosystem.The Pixel 10 Pro sticks to what Google does best: excellent cameras, clean design, and long-term software support. Its triple-camera system delivers consistently great results, whether you’re shooting your cat in low light or capturing a skyline at golden hour. The display gets a modest but useful boost in brightness, and now supports Qi2 wireless charging for faster, cable-free top-ups. That said, Google dropped the physical SIM tray in favor of eSIM-only support with the Pixel 10 series. That’s not a problem if your carrier is compatible, but it could be limiting if you switch networks often or travel internationally.Where it stumbles is in the details you won’t see in a spec sheet. The new AI tools, like voice-assisted summarizing and text generation, feel more like experiments than must-haves. The Tensor G5 chip performs smoothly in general, but reportedly falls behind Snapdragon chips in third-party app performance. Battery life is okay, not great—it’ll get you through the day, but not with much to spare, notes this PCMag review, so power users may need to top up before the end of the day. Still, if you're already in the Pixel world or looking to switch from another Android phone, this discounted Pixel 10 Pro feels like a confident step forward in all the right ways.For anyone who wants more screen space or a foldable option, the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup is also discounted for Black Friday. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is going for $899, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is priced at $1,499, down from its original $1,799.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

And for Cyber Monday, the Venu X1 is on sale for $599.99 ($200 off its normal price $799.99).\nThe X1 is Garmin's biggest screen—41 x 46 millimeters with a two-inch diagonal measurement—making it easy to view maps, data, and notifications at a glance. You also get an LED flashlight built into the watch, handy for early morning runs or fumbling with your keys in the dark. The scratch-resistant sapphire lens adds durability, while built-in maps mean you can navigate without pulling out your phone. There's also a speaker and microphone for taking calls or using a voice assistant directly from your wrist.Solid training and trackingThe X1 includes coaching for running, cycling, and strength training, plus all the health and fitness tracking Garmin is known for. It goes without saying that Garmin watches deliver excellent GPS accuracy and reliable heart rate readings—qualities that matter whether you're logging casual jogs or training for your next race.Beyond the usual activity profiles and running-specific metrics, the X1 supports a wide range of sports including motorcycling, rock climbing, and golfing (with extra features tailored to the course). The battery lasts up to eight days, so you won't be tethered to a charger constantly.If you prefer a round watch geared specifically toward serious runners and athletes, check out Garmin's high-end Fenix line also on sale today.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

The Fitbit Google Ace LTE leans fully into that balance, and this price drop to $99.95 from $179.95—its lowest ever, according to price trackers—makes it easier to consider.\n Fitbit has been in the “make healthy habits fun” business for years, and Google’s influence shows in how polished the Ace LTE feels. The watch uses animated creatures and simple games to nudge kids between seven and 11 toward movement. The catch—which is the whole point—is that you can’t sit and play uninterrupted. Every few minutes, the watch asks for a bit of movement, like hitting a step goal, before the game continues. For a lot of parents, that structure helps turn the watch into a tool that encourages activity rather than another screen to fight over.Where the device becomes more than just a toy is in the built-in LTE GPS tracking. The watch can send and receive calls and texts, and you can see your child’s location through the companion Fitbit Ace app, which you install on your phone. It works with both iOS and Android, and the parental controls cover the basics, including contact management. There are limits, though. The Ace LTE doesn’t support music apps or sleep tracking, and this PCMag review notes that there’s occasional sluggishness when swapping between features. Still, the hardware itself feels sturdy, and the screen is easy for kids to navigate.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, the software is clearly built around the subscription model. And that subscription is the real consideration here. The watch requires a $9.99 monthly Ace Pass for GPS location tracking, LTE features, and access to the games—an ongoing cost you have to factor into the decision. Without the subscription, the watch becomes a basic step counter, and if it’s only doing that, you might as well get the older Fitbit Ace 3. Still, for families who want reliable location tracking and a structured way to encourage daily movement, the Ace LTE offers both in a kid-friendly package.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

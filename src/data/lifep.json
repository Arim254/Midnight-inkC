Before the likes of TikTok and Instagram Reels, online video content was more long-form than not. It might have felt short by the standards of cable TV, but many of the videos  on platforms like YouTube were regularly anywhere from two to 10 minutes, if not longer. The first platform to really popularize short-form content as we think of it now was Vine. These videos were short—a maximum of six seconds at a time, which should have spelled the platform's doom. Who would want to watch these tiny videos back to back for hours at a time? A lot of us, apparently. Vine compilations garner millions (if not tens of millions) of views on YouTube. While the Twitter-owned platform only lasted about five years, it established itself as a true cultural phenomenon. Quote the first half of a popular vine to a group of young millennials or Gen Zs, and, chances are, they'll finish the line. For years, us Vine fans have longed for someone to bring the app back. Sure, short-form video has never been more addicting, but it's just not the same. Videos on Vine had a much different feel than most of the content you see on TikTok. Maybe it was the limited runtime; maybe it was the stripped-down recording interface. But to me, Vine feels like early YouTube: homemade, indie, and fun.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDivine is the new VineIt seems that experience might actually be making a comeback. A new app, Divine, is trying to recreate the magic of those six-second loops. Divine, built by former Twitter employee Evan Henshaw-Plath and funded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is meant to be a platform to share vines old and new. Of course, you can upload fresh six-second clips, but the app will also feature 150,000 to 200,000 \"archived\" vines from roughly 60,000 creators. You won't have to rely on those Vine compilations anymore—you can watch those classic clips directly on Divine. Those videos aren't scraped from YouTube compilations, either. According to TechCrunch, Vine's original library was stored by the organization \"Archive Team\" in a huge but largely inaccessible archive. Henshaw-Plath studied the library, extracting as much data as possible to build profiles for the original Vine accounts and display metrics like views and original comments. Though not all Vines were archived, including \"millions of K-pop-focused videos,\" Henshaw-Plath believes \"a good percentage\" are available on Divine. Vine creators can choose to either take down their videos from Divine or take over their profiles on the app, so long as they prove their identities. Divine is also a decentralized social media platform running on the Nostr protocol. That means no one company owns it, which means your content is your content. When you post, your videos are tied to you via private keys, so you can always prove ownership. Plus, there are no user-specific algorithms. You have to choose what you want to watch, or jump into an algorithm created by the Divine community. My favorite part of this experiment, however? No AI. At a time when  other social media platforms are inundated with hyperrealistic videos from generators like Sora, Divine has a strict no-AI policy. Divine uses tech from the Guardian Project to confirm whether a video was filmed on a smartphone. If the system detects a video is artificial, it gets taken down. It's enough to make this tech editor shed a (joyful) tear. How to join DivineAs you might expect, there's a lot of demand to try Divine at launch. At this time, the company says its beta test is full. However, you can sign up for the waitlist to be notified when more spots open up. You can also browse clips on the platform's web app right now, even without an account, but I've found it to be a bit glitchy.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple brought RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging to the iPhone with iOS 18 last year, giving green-bubble users access to more features and functions. But what exactly is possible with RCS on the iPhone, and what is still exclusive to iMessage users? Are Android RCS users now fully integrated into chats in the iOS Messages app or not?I'll lay out exactly what you can do in RCS chats between iPhones and Android phones, and explain which features are still missing—and when you might be able to get them.  If you've got contacts on other mobile platforms, this should help you understand more about what the experience is like from their end.To use RCS, you must have a carrier that supports it (most now do). On an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging to enable it. In Google Messages on Android, tap your profile picture (top right), then choose Messages settings and RCS chats to turn on the feature.\nEver since iOS 18, RCS messaging has officially been supported in the iOS Messages app—specifically, via the RCS Universal Profile 2.4. This brings green bubble Android users closer to parity with iMessage users, though some features only work in one direction, and some features only work in one-to-one conversations and not group chats.One notable upgrade is support for high-resolution photos and videos, which should work seamlessly across all your RCS-enabled conversations, with no more issues around compression or transfer. Web links look better as well, because you'll get a proper preview shown on both Android and iOS, and you can share current locations too (though only as a static pin, not a live and updating one).\n    \n            \n            Web links now look much better between iOS and Android.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTyping indicators and read receipts are supported in both directions, assuming you've got them enabled on your devices. However, they don't work in group chats—RCS users on Android can now join group chats, but the experience can be buggy based on reports, and you lose the typing indicators and the read receipts.Emoji reactions are now supported, up to a point—but based on my testing, these only work from iPhone to Android. If you try and send an emoji reaction in the other direction, iPhone users will just get a separate text showing the emoji (it won't appear as a bubble on top of the original message).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRCS on iOS and Android: what you can't do (yet)If you look at everything you can do in iMessage (with other iMessage users) and Google Messages (with other Android RCS users), you'll realize there's a long way to go when it comes to cross-platform support. For example, at the moment you can't unsend messages, or reply inline in a thread, either from Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android.You can edit messages, but only if you're an Android user messaging an iPhone user—and with the caveat that the iPhone user gets two texts (the original message and the edited message, which rather defeats the point). The ability to edit messages on an iPhone simply doesn't appear in an RCS conversation.\n    \n            \n            Message editing is something that doesn't quite work yet.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAnother missing feature is end-to-end encryption for your chats and files shared in them. Apple has promised that support for this in RCS conversations is on the way, though it hasn't shown up yet—not even in iOS 26. This should give you pause when it comes to sharing sensitive information in these chats.Full end-to-end encryption is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which Google is testing in beta and which Apple has yet to adopt. Once this next update finally makes its way to iPhones and Android devices, interoperability will be leveled up again—it should, in theory, bring with it full support for message editing, emoji reactions, and inline replies. Until then, it's something of a half-baked implementation, especially for group chats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        If you've booked a hotel through a platform like Booking.com or Expedia, beware any communication that directs you to confirm your payment details to hold your reservation. Threat actors are targeting the hospitality industry with a phishing campaign designed to steal from travelers. As outlined by security firm Sekoia.io and reported by The Hacker News, the scheme is referred to as \"I Paid Twice\" because hotel customers are eventually conned into handing over their banking information. Scammers contact guests via WhatsApp or email about their booking, saying that they need to verify their payment or risk cancellation. The link goes to a fake landing page that looks like Booking.com or Expedia, where victims are prompted to provide card information. This isn't the first scam to target Booking.com: Scammers have previously spoofed the site to spread malware directly to users via both fake CAPTCHAs and homograph attacks, which exploit similar characters in the URL to redirect to a malicious website. \nThis multi-step campaign actually begins when hackers target hotels themselves with ClickFix attacks, a type of social engineering attack designed to trick users into downloading malware via fake error messages or CAPTCHA forms. (I've covered a handful of ClickFix schemes, such as those spread via AI-generated instructional videos on TikTok and expired invite links on Discord.) The scam runs as follows: Hotel managers receive emails from compromised accounts with phishing links that redirect to a supposed reCAPTCHA page. This is the ClickFix component, as targets are instructed to complete the challenge to \"ensure the security of your connection.\" A couple of redirects lead to the user copy and execute a PowerShell command that downloads a Remote Access Trojan (like PureRAT) to their device. Once the malware has been delivered, it allows threat actors remote access, including control of the mouse and keyboard, data exfiltration, command execution, file uploads and downloads, keylogging, and webcam and microphone capture. Hackers are then able to steal admin credentials to gain access to booking platforms and send the aforementioned phishing emails to hotel guests—or they can sell the information to other cybercriminals. Don't fall for the hotel booking scamYou can't control whether a hotel manager unwittingly hands over access to your booking information. But you can avoid further compromising your personal and financial data by staying vigilant to any unexpected communication about your reservation. A reputable hotel probably won't contact you via a booking platform (nor will the platform itself) to demand payment for holding a reservation you've already confirmed. This sense of urgency is meant to trick you into acting quickly, so if you're not sure what's going on, call the hotel directly using the number on their official website (not from the email or WhatsApp message). Don't click any links, and don't enter any information unless you have confirmed that you are on a legitimate booking platform or hotel website. \n            ",

But even when you know what tasks need to be done, you still need to figure out how to prioritize them, so you can tackle them in the right order while giving each the amount of attention and resources they actually need. Here's where you can use the 3-3-3 method.What is the 3-3-3 method?This technique comes from Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals. He advocates planning each workday around a 3-3-3 model:First devote three hours to deep work on your most important project. Next, complete three other urgent tasks that don’t require three hours of focus. Finally, do three “maintenance” tasks, like cleaning, answering emails, or scheduling other work. Other productivity techniques, like the pomodoro method, call for you to engage in deep work, or completely uninterrupted work with no distractions, so consider tapping into one of those first three hours if you want to make the most of a 3-3-3 approach.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo figure out which of the above categories a task fits into, I recommend a prioritization method like the Eisenhower matrix, which involves using a quadrant system to divvy up your responsibilities by urgency and importance. You'll want to consider not only how timely the things you need to do are, but also how many resources they'll consume. Remember not to overestimate the amount of time your tasks will take you—the longer you give yourself to work on something, the more you'll naturally drag out your work, which hampers productivity. Be firm with yourself when deciding how long to allot for a major, resource-heavy task.If you don't consider yourself a morning person and aren't sure you can jump into a heavy workload right away in the day, it's not necessarily a problem. I've written about the value of eating the frog—or, rather, tackling your biggest task of the day right away when you get up, which is a part of the traditional 3-3-3 structure—and though I've tried it myself, I'm just not that kind of person. It doesn't mean I can't work within a 3-3-3 framework, so don't feel like you can't, either. Play around with the technique, maybe by starting later in the morning and pushing your lunch back. I find this approach helpful because, truthfully, I really only buckle down around 10:30 every day. Because I am a slower person in the morning, I rearrange my 3-3-3s, tackling maintenance tasks earlier in the day, which keeps me feeling motivated and productive—getting things like answering emails out of the way clears my mind so I can focus on my bigger tasks more easily later.The key to succeeding with a technique like this isn't forcing yourself to fit a mold, but molding the method to your own best working habits, giving yourself a little extra structure, within reason. The goal here is to be discerning about what you take on in a day and work in the right order to maximize productivity, but you have a little wiggle room, so try a few approaches to your schedule to see what works.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy the 3-3-3 method worksWhat distinguishes this method from other productivity hacks are those three hours of deep work. Usually, jumping into them first means you’ll be fresh, focused, and more likely to be able to focus on a task without getting distracted. Regardless of if you stick to the traditional structure of doing three hours of deep work first in your day or mess with the 3-3-3 schedule, make sure to keep those three hours free of emails, texts, chit-chat, or other menial duties, to the best of your ability. Deep work yields major productivity, so you’ll get a lot accomplished if you commit to it, but you can’t stay in that mindset forever. You’ll top out after about three hours, so it’s best to have those three other, smaller tasks lined up and ready to go so you can stay productive even while downshifting into less demanding responsibilities. After three hours in the zone, you should find that those tasks are easier.Finally, your maintenance tasks give you a chance to get things done while giving your brain a rest. Use your maintenance time to prepare for the following day’s work, put finishing touches on whatever you were working on during those three hours of intense focus, or, like me, get the most boring things over with so you can think about something else.You can use this technique to tackle seven different tasks of varying urgency levels or to break one major project down into smaller chunks, depending on what your day needs.

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. But it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple Music has been steadily getting useful new features since the release of iOS 26, and the latest changes are especially exciting. Finally, the music streaming service is adding support for offline lyrics, which will officially come in iOS 26.2 when it releases in the next few weeks (although you can try them out now via the iOS 26.2 beta). Meanwhile, in iOS 26.1, users got the ability to swipe on the mini player to go to the next or previous song in their lineup, alongside enhanced AI DJ features and playlist folders for improved music organization. These followed previous additions, such as lyrics translation, a new DJ-like feature called AutoMix, and animated cover art on the lock screen. If that sounds like a lot, I've got you covered. Here are all the new Apple Music features in iOS 26, starting with the most recent.Apple Music lyrics now work offlineWhen I travel, I rarely have access to great connectivity. It always annoys me when Apple Music just stops showing lyrics while I'm offline, which happens whenever I take a flight, or when I'm traveling in the beautiful mountains in my country. Previously, I would download songs from Apple Music to keep me company during these offline periods, but I did miss having access to lyrics. That's about to change with iOS 26.2, which is currently available in beta. Eagle-eyed Reddit users spotted support for offline lyrics in iOS 26.2, so you can expect it to ship to your iPhone soon.Swipe to change songs\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nThis is one of the most exciting additions to Apple Music, and it came in iOS 26.1. When you're listening to music in the app, you can swipe left or right on the mini player to switch to the previous or next song. Previously, you had to expand the mini player to see the previous/next song buttons, but now swapping music is much faster. And even if the player is expanded, you can still swipe on the song's name up top to change the track.\nLyrics Translation for your favorite songsApple Music has had time-synced lyrics for a while now, which works great when you speak the language the song was written in. However, it's not as helpful when you're listening to songs in different languages, and that's where Lyrics Translation comes in. It adds translations below each time-synced lyric line, making it easy to follow a song's meaning, too. I've been seeing translated lyrics for many songs across multiple languages, even when the primary song lyrics are in a non-Roman script.Learn how to pronounce lyrics correctly\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nAnother iOS 26 lyrics upgrade lets Apple Music show you the correct pronunciations for lyrics in foreign languages. Not every song has lyrics in Roman script, so if you can't read the alphabet they're in, this new feature will help you learn how to pronounce those words. It does this by showing you a transliteration from the original script to Roman, which makes it easier to sing along. I've been listening to songs by various Indian musicians, and noticing that Apple Music almost always has transliterations available to help with pronunciation.AutoMix is an AI DJ for your playlistsAutoMix is a new addition to Apple Music's playback controls. You'll see it alongside the Shuffle, Repeat, and Autoplay buttons. When enabled, AutoMix will analyze the audio features of songs and use DJ-like tricks such as time stretching and beat matching to deliver continuous playback. Initially, I did not like AutoMix much because it often made the transitions between songs very jarring. Over time, that has become a lot less noticeable, but I still wouldn't use it with any of my own painstakingly curated playlists, where I've manually matched the sounds at the end of one song with the sounds at the start of the next one. With the release of iOS 26.1, Apple Music has also added AutoMix support over AirPlay. This means that, when using AutoMix while streaming songs from my iPhone to my HomePod mini (or any other AirPlay speaker), the AI DJ will continue to do its thing. Sort playlists into custom folders\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI enjoy Apple Music's editorially curated playlists, but my friends and I have already curated a bunch of playlists for our various moods and occasions. I listen to these frequently, but finding them becomes a bit of a challenge when you've added hundreds of playlists to your account. Thanks to Apple Music's new playlist folders, I've been able to tame this chaos quite easily. Get started by opening the Music app on your iPhone and going to Library > Playlists. Tap the + button in the top-right, and select Create New Folder. The good news is that you're free to create nested folders if you wish, which is perfect for all those obsessed with organization. Pin your favorite playlistsThis is a sweet feature that lets you quickly open your favorite Apple Music playlists. You can press and hold any playlist in the Music app in iOS 26, and pin it to the top of the Library tab. If you've pinned your favorite contacts in Messages, then you'll find music pinning to be a familiar feature. You can pin up to six items at a time in Apple Music, which is ideal for bookmarking your favorites.Animated cover art comes to your lock screenAnimated cover art is one of the more visually appealing features of Apple Music, and now it's coming to your lock screen as well. When you play a song that has animated album art, you can tap the player on the lock screen to see it in a neat full-screen view.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're not happy with having your music on the lock screen alone, you'll enjoy Apple Music's iOS 26 home screen widgets. You can quickly add different sized widgets to any of your iPhone's home screens, and start playing music without even launching the Music app. You can choose widgets that show recently played music, top music in your region, recommendations, or even radio stations. Each home screen widget for Apple Music is available in three sizes, so you can pick one that's best for your current home screen layout.A karaoke feature for Apple TV usersApple Music is also getting a new feature called Sing, which only works if you have an iPhone with iOS 26 and an Apple TV running tvOS 26. With all those requirements in place, you can use your iPhone as a mic and have your voice amplified by Apple Music to have a fun karaoke experience right at home.\n            ",

Spotify is doing its best to fix at least one of those problems, by testing AI recaps for some of its audiobooks.It's the first new AI-powered feature in a while that I would actually use. In fact, I've played a few video games with similar features (not powered by AI, admittedly), and it's always such a value-add that it makes me pine for it in pretty much every other piece of media I engage with.Here's how Spotify's new feature works: First, you unfortunately do need to be using the Spotify app for iOS, so Android, web, or desktop listeners are out of luck, at least during this beta test. Then, you'll need to have listened to a supported English language audiobook for at least 15-20 minutes. After that, you'll see a Recap button at the top of the page that will quickly generate a one- to two-minute-long summary of what's happened in the book so far, which Spotify promises will be spoiler-free for future plot events. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nPreviously on [your book]Spotify's likening it to a \"previously on\" segment on a TV show, although it also says that, \"Recaps do not replicate narration or replace the original audiobook in any way,\" so don't expect to hear actual clips from the book, nor an AI voice trying to mimic the narrator. However, just as TV's \"previously on\" segments will change with new episodes, your AI Recap will be \"regularly updated to match your progress.\"As for any potential issues with the feature, the company says it is \"not using audiobook content for LLM training purposes or voice generation\" and that authors can opt out of having Recaps on their books. Still, there are a few caveats, including the fact that the Recap feature isn't free.On the plus side, it is included alongside the free audiobook hours you get with Spotify Premium, as well as any add-on hours you might buy. But otherwise, audiobooks on Spotify need to be bought on a per-book basis, so for users without Spotify Premium and with no audiobooks in their libraries (that's me), there's no way to try AI Recaps before you buy, which means it's maybe not a convincing reason to swap audiobook platforms just yet.Not all books will get RecapsSpotify's also not being upfront about which books have Recaps, so it could be a bit before you see the button pop up for you. So while I like the idea in theory, I'm probably not going to get to test it anytime soon. (I've reached out to Spotify to ask for a current list of books with Recaps enabled, and will update this article when I hear back.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCould Recaps include hallucinations?Another potential issue with these Recaps: hallucinations. Spotify didn't address accuracy at all in its announcement, which I'd like to think implies the company is feeling pretty confident it won't be an issue. But there is still a potential for an AI to misreport specific details of your story, or accidentally slip a spoiler in regardless of what Spotify claims. One would hope your memory would be jogged enough by a general outline to catch inconsistencies, but still, it might be worth keeping a few notes while you read, just in case.How to get AI summaries for any book (without using Spotify)If you aren't a Spotify audiobook listener or just haven't gotten to try the beta, I'll give you a cheat: You can already ask other AI chatbots for book summaries for free. So long as you remember where you left off, just head over to your AI of choice and ask for a summary up to that point. Here's one for the opening chapters of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt (via ChatGPT)\n                    \n    \nI won't deny that there's real convenience in having a summary feature baked directly into your app, especially one that doesn't require you to cross reference where you left off lest you, I don't know, spoil the Red Wedding for yourself or something. But if you're like me (not a Spotify audiobook customer), at least you're not out of options.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You can (and should) prioritize your to-dos by timeliness and time box your way to a jam-packed, detailed schedule, but there’s more to time management than that. You should also consider dividing up not only your day, but your week overall, to maximize productivity. The trick here is to theme your workdays. Instead of jumping from task to task on any given day, try grouping all the similar ones together and parking them on a specific day, when your schedule allows. By putting similar tasks together on the same day, you’ll stay in that “zone” longer, focusing only on what needs to be done in it. If all the things you have to do have something in common, you’ll stay focused on the central theme of the day’s work as you move from task to task.How to divvy up themed days for productivityFirst, start by thinking about why you want to do what you're doing. I don't mean you need to get all philosophical, but adding a \"why\" to your to-do list is valuable. You don't just want to clean your house because you have to, but because you want a safe, comfortable space or because your mom is coming to say for a week and you want her to feel cozy (and not harp on you about any lingering dust). You don't just want to finish your big project at work because it was assigned to you, but because you want to grow in your career, stay employed, or get a promotion. If thinking this way is a stretch for you, try setting SMART goals around your tasks. SMART goals are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (in accordance with the acronym) and they help you stay focused on why you're doing what you're doing, as well as how you're going to do it.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSet these intentions so you feel like you have something to work toward. That's where the daily themes come in. If you complete similar tasks over the course of one day, you are striving for an intention—meeting whatever goal you’ve set for that day’s theme—and staying focused on it from task to task.Say you have a big project at work. Here's how your first three days could look: Consider getting all administrative-type work done on Mondays. Designate Mondays for responding to emails, sending out new ones, taking calls, or scheduling meetings. Make sure you use this day to request any resources, details, or answers you need from others involved in the project, so you have everything you need for the following days. Creative activities, like brainstorming or designing, could be handled Tuesday, while Wednesday could be for research.You could also theme your days by project, according to Leonard Alexandru, an engineering director at Deloitte who has written about the value of themed days. Instead of dedicating time every day to multiple projects, consider assigning each project its own specific day of the week for work, so a project that requires a big focus on management should take up a whole day while one that requires you to focus on marketing, communications, sales, or whatever else should be on another.Why this works (and what to keep in mind)I do this around my apartment: One day is for cleaning my bedroom, the other is for the living room, and another is for the kitchen. It is that simple—and broadly applicable beyond your job. Hell, if you do strength training, you probably already do arm day, back day, leg day, etc. You wouldn't do a lat pulldown on leg day because it wouldn't make sense to exhaust your whole body, nor divert your focus from your glutes and quads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reason it works is the same reason divvying up gym days works. When you are focused entirely on one thing, you do better at it, which makes you more productive at it. When you throw everything into the metaphorical blender, you lose that focus. Plus, the stress of figuring out what to do at a given time is gone, leaving you open to just get to work. You can \"eat the frog\" (that is, tackle your biggest task first) or work off a system like 1-3-5, which calls on you to take care of one major task, three medium-sized ones, and five smaller ones. With a themed grouping, you don't have to decide what those are; you just go.Try setting each day’s theme as an all-day event on whatever calendar software you use, so you’ll have a reminder at the top of the page about what to focus on each day. Just knowing your Thursdays are for client meetings, for instance, relieves you of the anxiety of deciding what to prioritize that day or when to schedule those meetings. It eliminates decision fatigue and keeps you on-task without you having to think too hard about what activity should go in what slot during your busy week. Obviously, a necessary or urgent meeting could crop up on a day that isn't Thursday. It's fine to take it, of course, but try to keep the general framework of the themed days whenever you can. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Hell, even when you're alone at your desk, are you locked in on that spreadsheet or graphics project for eight straight hours, or might you be sipping a drink or texting your spouse every once in a while? There are simply some hours that aren’t true work hours, even if they occur during the work day. Times like these are known as idle time or downtime—but there’s a difference between the two, and understanding that can actually help you work smarter and be more productive.The difference between idle time and downtimeThese terms don’t just refer to the time experienced by people in the workplace; they also refer to—and come from—the tools we use to get our jobs done. The terms come from the tech world. Essentially, idle time is any time when an asset is waiting to run or isn’t scheduled to run, and downtime is when the asset can’t run, due to an outage or planned maintenance. For example, idle time happens when you’re waiting for your computer to boot up; downtime happens when the computer just won’t turn on. Outside of tech, idle time happens as you wait for a coworker to formulate a response to a question you asked, but downtime happens when they just don't respond and you're waiting in limbo, unable to work without their answer.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSo, for people, idle time is nonproductive time that occurs when there’s a lack of demand or an unforeseen work stoppage. When you have all the tools you need available to you, but no reason to use them, you’re in idle time. If you’re working on a pitch deck, for instance, and need approval from a higher-up before you move forward on it, you’re idle while you wait for that approval, even though you could open the program to work on it. The reason you don't do that isn't that you don't have the tools; it's that you don't want to waste time doing it wrong.Downtime isn’t necessarily bad. Throughout the day, you need to take breaks from working. In fact, taking regular breaks makes you more productive, but that's more if you intend to take them, instead of having them foisted on you by someone or something else's failure to provide the tools you need. You can run into idle time that is caused by what corporate psychologists call “the dead-time effect,” which is when you’re overworked and stop being productive. In the productivity world, this is known as Illich's Law: The more you work without a break, the less productive you eventually get as the quality of your work declines. It’s better to pre-plan downtime than let idle time occur because of burnout. The trick to making idle and downtime work for you and your company is scheduling.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nScheduling around idle and downtimeDowntime can also occur when too many people are away from the office, say, on vacations or out sick. In that case, unlike idle time, a job can’t just be done whenever everything is ready, as the key tools—in this case, the people—are completely offline. To avoid losses from idle time and downtime, you need a solid scheduling plan. First, you should personally schedule around idle time. For instance, if you work in an environment that depends on the delivery of certain assets or products, pad time into your schedule to account for how long that might take. If it should take one day, leave padding for two, and fill up any idle slots with work you can accomplish without the shipment, if any. Use time boxing and time blocking, or the complete filling of your calendar, for this, and set two deadlines: the ideal date the shipment (or whatever you need) will be there, and a flexible time that you could still make work.For scheduling around downtime, make sure that you update your company-wide calendar whenever you’re going to be out and check for others’ outages when you’re making your personal schedule. Others’ downtime could lead to yours if you don’t account for the things you’ll need from them and get those before they’re gone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

On the one hand, these features have the potential to make shopping more convenient—on the other hand, maybe lowering friction isn't the best idea when it comes to spending money. Beyond selling you on convenience, these features all share something else in common—helping businesses up their clickthrough rates.It starts with AI Mode and Gemini, which can now access all the same information as Google Search's shopping tab. That means you'll start to see product cards alongside your AI answers, which you can click on for a bunch of shopping links, or hit a checkmark to compare the selected products. They won't show up on every question, but on about half of the prompts I tried, I got the option to spend money right away.Then, if you're still not sure you want to buy yet, now you can have Google's AI robocall local businesses for you to check on product availability and pricing, as well as any deals or bundles you might not know about. There are a few caveats—businesses can opt out, and Google will avoid calling them at odd hours or too frequently—but the idea is that if you're on the fence, you can have an AI help you know which stores to go to.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFinally, when it comes time to actually purchase whatever you're shopping for, you can have Google's AI check out for you. This feature is an extension of the existing price tracking feature, and will add a \"Buy for me\" button to any price tracking notifications you get from certain participating stores, like Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, or certain Shopify merchants. You'll get a link to the product you'd be buying from your notification, and the price will be pulled from that, so the company says you won't have to worry about the AI getting the price wrong. Instead, it's just supposed to remove any hesitation you might feel from having to enter your shipping or payment details into a checkout form.I won't deny that, when holiday shopping, I usually won't turn down assistance. But a continued refrain I had while hearing about these new features was \"Why?\"Personally, I'm mortified at the idea of sending employees at local businesses robocalls to deal with. And if I'm researching products, while it might be helpful to be able to involve an AI so I could ask specific question, I think I'd still prefer full access to all the filters and hundreds of links available in Google Shopping. The big thing for me, though, is agentic checkout. While I'm actually willing to trust Google that it won't make mistakes (and you do get a reference ID to hand to support in case it does), I'm also not sure why I'd want to go right from getting a price drop notification to having an AI spend money for me. It doesn't take long to fill out a checkout form, and while Google Shopping is a useful price tracking tool, it's not the only one around. I'd probably want to comparison shop a bit more before committing, at which point I might as well fill out the checkout form myself. But if you think about these features from the perspective of a business, the \"why\" behind all of this suddenly becomes a lot clearer. Turning people browsing web listings into actual paying customers has been a problem for about as long as the internet has existed, and all of these features introduce new opportunities for impulse purchases at every step of the buying process, while also erasing the opportunity for users to get caught up on a larger selection of options.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's not a conspiracy. Google charges companies for sponsored slots and ads, and the more people that buy products using a Google service, the more companies will want to pay for those. And for what it's worth, Lifehacker makes money on affiliate links. I won't deny that companies needs money, and that people need to buy gifts.What this does do, however, is reduce the friction that might pop up in between having an idle thought to buy something, and opening your wallet. While it plays at being a research buddy, it takes control out of your hands, obfuscates sources and other options, and instead encourages you to spend your money as quickly as possible, while discouraging skepticism.As someone who writes reviews and best-of lists, I like to think that my readers are a bit more savvy than that. Convenience is great, but taking the extra few minutes it takes to find an actual human opinion from someone who's used the product, or to double check that the price Google is serving you is really your best option, could save you from hours of pain down the line.Like most AI tools, there's potential here. But as much as AI will try to convince you that it's just some neutral buddy, remember that there are business motivations behind everything the companies behind these chatbots do. Keeping your whole shopping search in the same ecosystem as a company that's main profit still comes from ads and e-commerce probably isn't the best way to get your information.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

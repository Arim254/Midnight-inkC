On the surface, it does about what you'd expect, making it easy to browse games and Nintendo news, and even purchase games outright (albeit through an in-app browser window, presumably to avoid funneling Apple hefty commission fees). But hidden in the tiniest, most out-of-the-way button in the app is a detailed tracker for your play activity—finally fixing a feature that Nintendo consoles have dropped the ball on since the original Switch launched way back in 2017.The Switch has its own activity tracker, but it doesn't tell you much\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nOn their own, neither the Nintendo Switch nor Nintendo Switch 2 tell you much about your play history. It's easy to see, at least—you just need to select your profile picture in the top-left corner of the home screen to see your list of recently played games. But scroll down to check out your \"Play Activity,\" and you'll quickly be disappointed. Most of my games don't show an exact playtime number, instead either simply saying I've \"Played for a little while\" or \"Played for X hours or more.\" That's not very useful—and if try to you select a game to get more info, the system will just launch it instead.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt's much less handy than, say, the daily playtime reports the Wii used to show you right on the system, which told you what day you played on and for how long. Thankfully, the new Nintendo Store app brings that detailed info back, and then some.How to view your playtime on the Nintendo Store appTechnically, there was already a way to get detailed Nintendo Switch play activity through your smartphone, but it required setting up parental controls for yourself, a lengthy process that doesn't serve much of a purpose if you're an adult. Now, though, the Nintendo Store app makes it easy, and it's glorious.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nJust download and log into the Nintendo Store app with your existing Nintendo Account—the same one you used when you set up your system—and tap on your profile picture in the bottom-right corner. Scroll down to \"Play Activity,\" and you're all set: You'll see a customizable list of your games, and tapping on any one will show you not just your total playtime, but which days you played on and for how long.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nMy only complaint is that you won't have any idea of your playtime until you tap into a game, although you can sort the games list by total time played if you'd like; that will put games under categories for over 100 hours of play, over 50 hours, over 10 hours, and so on.The app even tracks playtime for the 3DS and Wii U\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe new app's coolest feature? It's not limited to Switch and Switch 2. This data goes way back, and if I scroll far enough (or sort by game system), I can also see my playtime for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U games. There is a catch—I don't seem to be able to see playtime by day for systems older than the original Switch, but I can see my total playtime, as well as how many separate days I played the game for. Again, to see your stats from these older consoles, you'll need to log in with the same Nintendo Account you used when you were playing on them—I've been using mine since the Wii U days.Back then, your Nintendo Account was known as your Nintendo Network ID. If you're a loyal Nintendo gamer, chances are good you linked your old Nintendo Network ID with your new Nintendo Account at some point in the past—but if you haven't, and you used to log in on your Wii U or 3DS with a different account, your play history isn't lost. If you scroll down to the bottom of the Play Activity screen, you should see the option to link the two accounts. Just tap that big red button and follow the prompts (if you can't remember than ancient login, the account recovery options still seem to be working, though the service was discontinued back in 2020.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Joel Cunningham / Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI'm a sucker for these kind of metrics, even if they're not fully representative of my play (I tend to bounce between my profile and my husband's profile a lot, as well as between systems). As embarrassing as it can be to see that I've spent more than 100 hours in Breath of the Wild, playtime data makes it easy for me to remember what I've played without having to keep a Letterboxd style game diary. It also encourages me to spend more time with games I might have just glanced at before or, if I'm feeling guilty after seeing a particularly big playtime number, to put down the system and spend some time outside.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.Researchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

However, sometimes less is more, as I'll get to below. Sadly, it seems Google is less keen on Chromebooks than I am. The last Google-made Pixelbook launched in 2019, and it's been left to the likes of Asus, Acer, HP, Samsung, and others to keep new Chromebooks coming in. If you're reading, Google, it's high time we had a new Pixelbook.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nChromebooks cut down on the clutterThere is the argument that Windows and macOS give you the Chrome browser plus a lot more, but most of the time, I don't really need the \"more\"—unless I've got some detailed image edits to do, or want to play some games. Almost everything I need runs on the web.There are a lot fewer software updates, background programs, app assistants, and system utilities to think about. While ChromeOS does have updates, they're mostly done seamlessly in the background, and applied whenever you next reboot your Chromebook.Another chore I don't have to regularly take care of on my Chromebook is tidying up the desktop or my local folders, because there isn't really anything to download, save, or sync. The laptop file system and internal storage is tidier by default, because I never use it.Chromebooks save everything instantly\n    \n            \n            No save button required.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAll the work I do on my Chromebook is inside a browser, and usually inside Google apps like Google Docs and Gmail. That means everything is instantly saved—should a power cut or a system crash happen, I don't have to worry about losing what I've been working on.I don't need to check for open programs and files in the background that I might have forgotten about, and if I need to jump up and do something else quickly, I can just shut my laptop and I'm done—I'm not clicking through dozens of save dialogs first.Chromebooks put everything on the webWhen you're working inside web apps all the time, without the option of locally installed tools, syncing is seamless. To work on a document that I need to access across Windows and macOS, for example, I need to think about saving, syncing, and app compatibility.When I'm working in Google Docs in a Chromebook, everything syncs automatically. I can even have a document open simultaneously across ChromeOS, Windows, and macOS, and jump between them as needed to make edits—something which saves a lot of time.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChromebooks tie in tightly to the Google ecosystem\n    \n            \n            Android phones and Chromebooks play nicely together.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI can understand that Chromebooks may have less appeal if you're not always using Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Google Docs, Chrome, and everything else Google makes—but for someone heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (like me), they make a lot of sense.If you've got an Android phone, for example, you can use it to set up a Chromebook, share files across both devices, respond to text messages from ChromeOS, and get hotspot access with a click. There's a level of integration you don't get on other platforms.Chromebooks actually work as distraction-free devicesOne of the criticisms leveled at Chromebooks is that they're pretty much useless without an internet connection, but that's only partly true. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and even Gmail actually work perfectly well offline now.If I'm traveling without steady wifi, I enjoy using my Chromebook as a distraction-free device, getting through a ton of writing and email replying without constantly switching tabs. When wifi returns, everything I've done gets synced back to the web automatically. While we're on the subject of ChromeOS being useless when it's not online, I think it's fair to say internet access is almost ubiquitous now (via public wifi or phone hotspots), and that Windows and macOS aren't particularly useful either when the web is cut off.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It all started last week, when Disney pulled its channels from YouTube TV, Google's Live TV service, over fee disputes. Now, Disney seems to be pulling content from other Google services as well. As first noted by 9to5Google, Disney movies are starting to disappear from YouTube's pay-per-view offerings too, and even other platforms like Google TV.For instance, try typing \"Avengers\" into your YouTube search bar right now. Aside from trailers and videos uploaded from individual users, you're more likely to see a rental option pop up for that 1998 Sean Connery and Uma Thurman spy movie than Marvel's superheroes. Meanwhile, Superman, a Warner Bros. movie, has a large \"Buy or rent\" button right at the top of the page.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe same goes for Lilo & Stitch. Currently, YouTube shows no option to buy or rent either the original Lilo & Stitch or its remake, but pay-per-view buttons for Dreamworks family movie The Bad Guys 2 show up front and center at the top of the page, just like with Superman. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nEven movies from Disney subsidiaries seem to be affected. While I was able to navigate to a rental page for Alien, which is now owned by Disney after its acquisition of Fox, I couldn't actually go through with purchasing the movie. Instead, I just saw a message saying, \"This video contains content from Fox. It is not available.\"\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI ran into the same issues trying to find these movies on other Google services, like Google TV (which also offers rentals, much like Apple TV) or the Play Store, but notably, all of the movies listed above are available on non-Google platforms, like Prime Video. Even older \"Disney Vault\" titles, like the original The Little Mermaid, are on Prime, but are nowhere to be seen on Google's services.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI've reached out to both Disney and Google for comment, and will update when I hear back. In the meantime, neither company has made an official statement about this seeming pay-per-view content blockade.My two cents? It's a negotiation tactic. YouTube's pay-per-view offerings are a separate service entirely from YouTube TV, and are thus likely unaffected by that platform's licensing deals. At the same time, in pulling more of its content from Google's other platforms, Disney can exert additional leverage on Google to pay up to stream its channels.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's not the only mind game going on right now, for what it's worth. At time of writing, it's currently the first major election day in the U.S. since last year's presidential election, and yesterday, Disney offered to temporarily return ABC to YouTube TV so viewers could keep up with the news. YouTube rejected the proposal, saying it would \"cause customer confusion\" and instead proposed that Disney \"immediately restore\" ABC and ESPN while negotiations continue, as a sign of good faith.\"Those are the channels that people want,\" YouTube said, implying that it is being overcharged for additional channels that viewers show little interest in. The company then said that if Disney is willing to play ball, it can \"get these channels live in hours.\"That's certainly more heated than we've seen past YouTube TV negotiations, which were largely settled before customers saw any impact, get. While it's possible Disney might actually take YouTube up on its offer, we're probably not out of the woods yet. Luckily for YouTube TV subscribers, YouTube is promising remediation if the situation drags on any further, and some have even started to see it. As someone who doesn't subscribe to YouTube TV but does rent movies through YouTube, though? I have to admit I feel a little caught in the crossfire.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Flight cancellations under the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) government shutdown order have begun, with hundreds of flights and thousands of travelers across 40 U.S. airports affected. This could continue for as long as the shutdown lasts (and potentially impact many more travelers as the busy holiday season approaches). While flight cancellations are never fun, the cascading effect of due to the government shutdown could make dealing with one even more frustrating. Here are four actions you should take right away if your itinerary is cut. Enable alerts from your airlineFlight cancellations often happen with little to no notice, sometimes when you're already en route to your destination, and airlines are certainly scrambling to comply with the FAA's shutdown order. As they continue to pare down their schedules, there's a chance your flight may be cut well before you head to the airport. \nTo keep yourself in the loop, download your airline's app and turn on push notifications so you receive status updates as soon as they're available—and keep an eye on your email and text messages for additional alerts. Check your rebooking options ASAPAirlines will often automatically rebook passengers whose flights are canceled on the next available alternative—so again, make sure you have your airline's app on your phone to quickly view your options. If the airline offers this, you can accept the rebooked itinerary, choose a different one, or reject it and get a refund instead. Going through the mobile app is likely to be much faster than queuing at the customer service counter or trying to get through over the phone. (Though if you do need to talk to an actual person at your airline, we've got a guide for that.)Of course, you should check your airline's guidance specific to shutdown cancellations. Frontier, for example, is waiving change and cancellation fees and allowing passengers to request a rebooked itinerary or refund, but you may not automatically be placed on the next flight. United is offering rebooking options as well as refunds to anyone who chooses not to travel, even if their flight isn't affected. You'll find relevant advisories on your airline's website (for example, Delta, American, JetBlue, and Southwest). Know what you're entitled toIf your flight is canceled less than 14 days before departure and you choose not to travel, you are entitled to a refund—even if you booked a nonrefundable or basic economy ticket. Airlines may offer travel credits or vouchers first, but you can try to request cash if that's your preference. You can look up your airline's standard commitments in the event of \"controllable\" cancellations on the Department of Transportation's Airline Cancellation and Delay Dashboard, but you should also check the policies specific to the FAA flight reduction as outlined above. Consider booking a backupIf your trip is an absolute must, you may want to book a back-up option at a different time, on a different airline, or through an alternative airport. While there's no guarantee that this flight won't also be canceled, it does at least increase your odds of getting to your destination with a confirmed seat while other affected travelers are being rebooked on itineraries hours or days later. You can buy a refundable ticket—knowing you'll either get to where you need to go or get the extra money back if your original itinerary works out—or use points and miles, which are often easily deposited back into your account if you cancel your ticket. Be sure to check the terms and conditions of your rewards program. You can also look into travel insurance, which will usually fully refund your purchase, albeit for a fee\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        November 19, 2025\n    \n            Credit: Justin Pot\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Back in the Windows XP days, when the only search functionality was a cartoon dog in the sidebar of Windows Explorer (not a joke), Google released Google Desktop. If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFinally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There are Chromebooks with OLED screens, high refresh rates, and even light-up keyboards, but no matter how many bells and whistles you slap on a Chromebook, it's still not going to have nearly as much raw processing power as a more traditional laptop.That's where cloud gaming comes in. This lets you stream games from the cloud, if you're willing to put up with a certain amount of video compression and input delay. One of the most popular cloud gaming services is Nvidia's GeForce Now, which lets you play select free-to-play titles and PC games you already own using the company's own data centers. The catch is that you either have to watch ads or pay up—but today, Google's Chromebooks are getting an exclusive new tier of GeForce Now that fixes both of these issues.Called GeForce Now Fast Pass, this version of GeForce Now is sort of like an expanded version of the existing free tier. You'll still be limited to playing at 1080p and 60fps—higher specs will require you to pay—and you won't have access to GeForce Now's \"Install-to-Play\" games, which means the library of compatible titles will be closer to 2,000 than 4,000. But unlike the free tier, you won't have to watch any ads, and you won't have to wait in a queue to start playing. Nvidia says the typical free-tier queue is only two minutes long, but hey, the sooner you can hop into the action, the better.\nStarting today, all new Chromebook purchases will come with a free year of GeForce Now Fast Pass, but there are some caveats. The big one is that you only get 10 free Fast Pass hours per month, although up to five unused hours will roll over to the next month.That means you'll still have to keep track of your time while playing, even if you don't have to watch ads. A Google spokesperson told me over email that once your Fast Pass hours are up, you'll be downgraded to the basic, ad-supported free tier, or you can purchase more Fast Pass hours a la carte. I wasn't told exactly how much these hours will cost, but given that a day pass (meaning 24 hours of play) of GeForce Now with no ads and higher specs than Fast Pass costs just $3.99, I can't imagine they'll be too expensive.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for when your year of Fast Pass is over, I'm still waiting for an answer on how to renew. I'll update this post once I hear back. I've also asked whether users that already have Chromebooks will be able to sign up for GeForce Now Fast Pass.One last bonus for Fast Pass, though, is that you don't have to actually use it on your Chromebook. You'll need a Chromebook to sign up (I'm also still waiting on exact steps for that), but once you've redeemed the offer, you'll be able to use it on any GeForce Now compatible device, like a phone or tablet.Overall, it doesn't exactly seem like something I'd go out of my way to buy a Chromebook for, but it could be a decent way to get good enough performance to play through about one short game per month, all without having to pay for GeForce Now or deal with ads or wait times. Combine that with the free games that sites like Epic give out on a regular basis, and you could essentially game casually for a year without buying anything other than your Chromebook. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I know I have done a poor job of keeping track of media as I have upgraded computers and phones over the years, and I've lost my fair share of photos, videos, and documents along the way, whether on misplaced or damaged external drives or from simply forgetting to back up at all. Here's how to ensure your data is available for years to come. \nYou need multiple backups of your dataOne approach to backing up your data is the 3-2-1 strategy, which says you should keep three copies of your data across two different forms of storage, one of which should be offsite (in case a disaster strikes your home). A simple example: You have your photos and files on your computer, which is backed up regularly to both an external hard drive and a cloud service. That's three copies of your data on two storage types—an onsite physical device and remote cloud storage—the latter of which satisfies the \"offsite\" requirement because it is geographically separate from your other two copies. This approach protects against a single point of failure, such as a primary device dying, losing an external hard drive, or getting locked out of a cloud account. When it comes to backing up your data, redundancy matters. As Reddit users note, there are different interpretations of how to apply the 3-2-1 rule, such as whether your working copy on your primary device counts as one of three and whether the one offsite copy is included in the two forms of storage. And while a strict 3-2-1 strategy, or variations of it, may be more commonly employed at the enterprise level rather than by the average consumer, you could think about it as a general guideline for improving your backup system, especially if you don't have one at all. How to set up backupsYou never know when a device might fail, so it's a good idea to plan frequent backups, whether your data is syncing regularly to the cloud or you set reminders to manually push updates to your external hard drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany users sync their devices automatically to a service like iCloud or Google Drive, but relying on this as your sole backup doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to access all of your files in the future. As HowtoGeek points out, these backups are typically mirroring what's currently on your device rather than historical versions—so once you delete a photo, file, or folder from your computer or phone, it's also deleted from the cloud backup. This is useful for quick access as well as restoring to a new or factory-reset device, but it doesn't do much for the scores of media collected over the years that you don't use daily. You could use a dedicated cloud backup service like IDrive or Backblaze, which come with a lot of storage space for automatic, full device backups. This may be best for users who have large files or a lot of media that is essential to their jobs as well as those who prioritize data privacy. (However, Wirecutter notes that most online backup services leave a lot to be desired.) Others may be fine to manually move files and media to free or low-cost cloud storage, including iCloud, OneDrive, and Google. At a minimum, another backup should live on an external hard drive—and if you're not going to do cloud backups, consider two external drives stored in separate locations. Hardware can obviously be lost, stolen, damaged, or simply degraded over time, so again, you shouldn't rely on a single drive for all of your storage. Apple's Time Machine and Windows File History make it easy to save backups to an external drive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Now, they've initiated proceedings against four more companies—the makers of the Samsung Galaxy Ring, Reebok Smart Ring, Amazfit Helio Ring, and the Luna Ring. Oura announced on their website that they have filed an ITC complaint against those four companies. The ITC is the U.S. International Trade Commission, and Oura says its complaint is \"for the unlawful importation and sale of products that infringe on several of Oura’s patents.\"Oura's previous win against Ultrahuman and RingConn resulted in a judgment that those companies had to stop selling and importing their smart rings. RingConn ultimately came to an agreement with Oura to license their patents and continue selling their rings. Circular and Omate have made similar agreements with Oura.\nUltrahuman no longer sells their ring in the U.S., but is working on a new ring design that would sidestep the alleged patent infringement. You can read Ultrahuman's take on the situation in this blog post, which also includes a promise to continue supporting rings that they have already sold or that people may buy from resellers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe rings in the recent complaint should still be available for a while. Oura says on their blog: \"So what’s next? The ITC process will run its course.\" There's no guarantee that Oura will win their case, although the fact they were able to get such a sweeping judgment against other companies suggests that it's not too much of a long shot. While Oura's communications around this issue use phrases like \"respect for IP\" (that is, intellectual property), as a consumer and a reviewer, I hate to see an exciting tech area get dominated by a single player or, worse, shut down by that player piece by piece. I'm working on a review of the Luna ring, which I've previously noted has some serious potential improvements over other rings on the market.

That means scammers are also busy contacting people, impersonating insurance providers in an effort to collect personal, financial, and medical information.Fraudsters especially love to impersonate representatives from Medicare, targeting older adults and others who qualify for the federal program with unexpected calls. As the Federal Trade Commission warns, scammers may have some of your personal information already and will ask you to confirm your Medicare, bank account, and/or credit card number under the guise of sending you a new Medicare card. In reality, Medicare cards are free and sent automatically, so you should never need to provide payment. Scammers may also target consumers on Marketplace, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans with a similar tactic, claiming that you may lose or be disqualified from health coverage unless you make a payment. \nIn addition to impersonating government officials, bad actors will pretend to represent a legitimate insurer, promising discounted plans (that are available only for a limited time) or enrollment assistance (for a fee). Plans that seem too good to be true probably aren't health insurance at all and may not provide the coverage promised. And you shouldn't have to pay anyone to sign up for a plan.  Note that while scammers may ramp up efforts during open enrollment, health insurance scams can happen year-round. A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) advisory warns consumers about common tactics like calls and texts in which scammers—impersonating government agencies or insurance companies—offer health screening, free gifts, or other promotional benefits in exchange for your personal information. Bad actors can pretty easily spoof phone numbers (so it looks like you're getting a call from a reputable insurance provider like Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield) as well as set up phishing websites designed to steal your credentials and financial information. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInsurance scam red flagsAs always, unsolicited communication that pressures you to take action is almost always a scam. Medicare representatives will never call, email, or text you to verify information or demand payment, nor will legitimate government officials try to sell you anything or threaten you unless you pay up. If someone claims they represent an insurer and asks for money or sensitive personal information, or if they threaten you with legal action, hang up. Don't share any data, including your social security number, bank account number, or medical history with anyone—that is, unless you have contacted the Medicare office or other legitimate agency directly and first and need to verify your identity. (The number for Medicare is 1-800-MEDICARE, and you can reach a Marketplace representative through HealthCare.gov). Always verify a representative's identity using official contact information found on a .gov website, legitimate company page, or an account statement, and never send money via gift card, prepaid debit, or crytocurrency in exchange for anything. You should also ensure your credentials for your insurance accounts (like HealthCare.gov and Medicare.gov) are strong and secure, and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

It saves me a lot of money and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The app picks up on your interests quickly, and before you know it, you're falling down an hours-deep rabbit hole every time you launch it. But the algorithm doesn't always get it right: Sometimes, you end up seeing too much of one type of content, no matter how many times you hit \"Not Interested.\" With the rise of AI-generated content, this problem only gets more frustrating. AI video generators like Sora are empowering people to produce more hyperrealistic AI slop than ever, which means you've likely encountered it on your feeds—whether you know it or not. I've certainly laughed at some AI clips here and there, but for the most part, I can't stand coming across them in the wild. And they aren't just a nuisance, they can be legitimately dangerous—some have even tricked users into installing malware on their smartphones. As this content become more normalized, I worry for our collective ability to spot misinformation across our social media platforms, so whenever you can take a step to reducing or removing this content from your feeds, I encourage you to do so.  \nAnd as it happens, TikTok is now experimenting with a tool to help you control the AI slop on your For You Page. Per a Wednesday press release, the company says it will roll out the new option in the existing \"Manage topics\" menu of the app's settings page. Manage topics already lets you finely tune parts of your individual TikTok algorithm to show you more of one subject or less of another—you can manage things like creative arts, current affairs, dance, fashion and beauty, food and drinks, health and fitness, humor, lifestyle, nature, pets, sports, travel. Soon, the section will add a slider for AI-generated content as well, if the option isn't live for you already. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to limit AI slop in TikTokTikTok says this new option is rolling out \"in the coming weeks,\" which is unfortunately vague. I don't have the option, even after installing the latest version of TikTok. However, that also means it could hit your app at any time. When it does, here's how to use it:Open TikTok, then tap \"Profile\" in the bottom right.Tap the hamburger menu icon in the top right, then choose \"Settings and privacy.\" Under \"Content & Display,\" choose \"Content preferences,\" then choose \"Manage topics.\"When the option is available on your app, adjust the \"AI-generated content\" slider. Move it left to see less AI-generated content, or move it right to see more of this content. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to completely remove AI content from your TikTok feed. Hopefully with this slider in place, however, you'll greatly reduce the amount of AI content you see, to the point where it's effectively gone entirely. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        At this late stage in the streaming era, we're all overwhelmed by more digital subscriptions than we can keep track of, from fitness apps to cloud storage. Still, it certainly feels as though Netflix is one of the subscriptions that people are least likely to ditch—and that's backed up by the numbers.Perhaps it's because Netflix was the first company to really make streaming work, or perhaps it's the vast catalog of content it's amassed, or perhaps it's just because of Stranger Things and Squid Game. Whatever the reason, Netflix's churn rate is impressively low. Subscribers stick with it.Certainly it's always something I've long considered a mainstay on my streaming device. But recently, in the midst of reevaluating all of my monthly subs, I decided to save myself some money and actually cancel Netflix. It has gone so well, I'd suggest you do the same.\nHere's what I've noticed since my life became Netflix-free—and I have a strong suspicion this might be your experience too. (Full disclosure: I will eventually subscribe again, if only to finish Stranger Things, but there are benefits to quitting, even if only temporarily.)I didn't miss it as much as I thought I would\n    \n            \n            Netflix content: There's a lot of it.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI was quite a heavy Netflix user before I gave it up, and would often cycle through the recommended list of shows and movies in the evening and especially on weekends. I've recently binged my way through shows like The Diplomat, Dept Q., Departure, and The Glass Dome. I could always find something to watch on Netflix.But when I stopped being able to access Netflix, I realized didn't really miss it all that much. My viewing switched to other streaming services, and free, ad-supported channels in particular. There's actually more free content out there than you might have realized. I even did some fun rewatches of movies and shows I'd previously purchased on various platforms (because I don't always want to rent something for the evening).I've also been spending less time streaming video in general—more of my time has been put towards gaming and reading since I ditched my Netflix subscription. I've even been to an actual movie theater once or twice (not that you can see anything developed by Netflix on the big screen for the most part). The prices keep going up\n    \n            \n            Need an extra member? That's an extra cost.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nBefore I quit Netflix, I was on the most expensive plan: It's £18.99 a month here in the U.K., and $24.99 a month in the U.S. This gets you the best audio and 4K HDR video quality, spatial audio, four simultaneous streams, and six devices for downloading content. It's actually one of the most expensive streaming packages there is, and prices keep going up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAfter the great password crackdown of 2023, you can't even share the account with anyone who doesn't live with you either—at least not unless you pay an extra fee (£4.99 here in the UK, $8.99 in the US). By any measure, that's a significant chunk of money. If you're paying for the best plan plus an extra member and decide to take six months off Netflix, you'll saving yourself more than $200.There are cheaper plans available of course, if you want to sit through ads and put up with lower-resolution video—but I thought the whole point of paying for streaming was to avoid ads? It's hard to imagine Netflix ever dropping its prices, so this is a problem that's likely to get worse over time.Your account will be preserved for two years\n    \n            \n            Netflix will hang on to all your viewing history for a while.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nOne of the reasons you might be reluctant to cancel Netflix is because you think you'll lose years' worth of your viewing history and your personalized recommendations, and have to start again with a blank slate if you decide to sign back up. But in fact, Netflix stores your account information for 24 months—including ratings, game saves, and other account details.As long as you resubscribe again within a couple of years, you'll find everything as you left it (though you may need to scan some plot recaps for shows you were halfway through binge watching). This suggests Netflix is keen to leave the option to resubscribe open as long as possible. In my experience, it'll definitely send you lots of emails about rejoining in the meantime.I'm going to go back to Netflix someday—there's just too much stuff on there that I want to watch—but after years and years as a customer, it's been an interesting experiment to see what life is like without it. Certainly after this, I wouldn't be worried about taking another Netflix break in the future. When I decide I want to resubscribe, it'll only take a couple of clicks or taps.\n            ",

In macOS 26 Tahoe, Apple's shipped a bunch of ways to customize the look and feel of your Mac's desktop, app icons, and menu bar, among other things. And there's more to it than just tweaking how Liquid Glass looks. If you're the sort of person who enjoys theming and customization, try these tips.Tweak app icons in the Dock\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYour Mac's Dock probably has a bunch of colorful icons. I've always enjoyed those diverse colors, but others might want something more uniform. If you feel like going with a particular tint, or if you just want your app icons to use dark mode, it's just a quick tweak away. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and go to System Settings > Appearance > Icon & widget style. Here, you can change the app icons to Dark, Clear, or Tinted. The Tinted option lets you select a single tint for all your app icons, so choose the color you like the most.Customize the clock in your Mac's lock screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOnce you upgrade to macOS Tahoe, you'll probably notice the new clock on your lock screen. You can tweak this to your liking, too. Just go to System Settings > Wallpaper > Clock Appearance. You can choose one of six clock styles. Don't forget to adjust the slider below the Weight option, which lets you change the font to make the clock look sleeker or more prominent.\nCustomize the Control Center\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWith iOS 18's release in 2024, Apple started letting you customize your iPhone's Control Center. This year, that feature is finally on Mac, starting with macOS Tahoe. To use it, just click the Control Center button in the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen, and select Edit Controls. There are plenty of controls to choose from, so take your time and add what you need. You can drag-and-drop any of the controls to move them around, or you can click the - (minus) button next to any control to remove it from the Control Center. Alternatively, you can tweak your control center under System Settings > Menu Bar > Menu Bar Controls.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nOne of the more controversial changes to macOS Tahoe is the swap to a transparent menu bar. The clear color sometimes makes it harder to read text, but if you don't like that, you can restore a background to your menu bar. This feature is under System Settings > Menu Bar > Show menu bar background.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChange folder icon colors on Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're tired of the default blue color for folder icons, macOS Tahoe lets you tweak this to suit your style. Go to System Settings > Appearance > Folder color and use the drop-down menu to change the color of folder icons. I'd have never thought of myself as a person who uses orange folder icons, but I suppose we all go through a tangerine season at some point in our lives.Switch Mac theme in Settings\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nmacOS Tahoe also gives you limited control over your Mac's theme. If you go to System Settings > Appearance > Theme and pick a color, you'll notice that this color also applies to the cursor in writing apps, and the color of selected items in menus, too. On the same menu page, you can also choose a different color for highlighted text, which is a nice additional level of customization. It ensures that if I pick a particularly bright color for my overall theme, I can still choose a milder color for text selection. That helps me stay focused while I'm working, which is something I value a lot.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

However, you can still give a nice gift to someone who wants to do their own home maintenance or build their own shelves—you just have to know what to look for. Here are some of the best tools you can give for under $100, from someone who personally loves to wield a power drill.Best cordless tools under $100Cordless tools can be some of the most expensive for a home tool set because they need batteries and chargers in addition to the tool. Having batteries that work with multiple tools can be a big advantage because then you don’t necessarily need to have a different battery for each tool. Here are a few good deals on quality cordless tools that have battery platforms that work with hundreds of other tools and are durable as well.The Ryobi 18-volt driver set is $55.94 at Home Depot right now. The drill comes with a 1.5-amp-hour battery, a charger, and a 30-piece bit set, so it’s a good gift from someone starting a DIY tool kit because it has everything you need to start using it right out of the box. The Ryobi 18-volt battery platform includes over 300 cordless tools, so beginning with this battery set allows you to expand your kit in many directions.The Dremel 12-volt cordless multitool starter set is a good gift for a DIYer who is interested in metal smithing, wood carving, or even trimming a dog’s nails, and it’s $99 right now at Home Depot. The cordless feature makes a Dremel more portable, and easier to control because you don’t need to worry about dragging an extension cord around behind you. The starter set comes with a battery, a charger, and a small set of accessories, so it’s a good set as a gift because it’s ready to use right out of the box.The Ryobi 18-volt cordless brad nailer is a good gift for someone who is interested in installing trim or making woodworking projects like a birdhouse, and you can get it for $99 right now at Home Depot. It has a depth control and a built-in LED light that makes it more convenient in my experience when you’re working in tight spaces. While battery operated nailers used to be a little underpowered, improvements in battery technology and engineering have made them more functional in the last few years. This is a good gift for someone who already has an 18-volt Ryobi battery set or if you plan to buy batteries separately because it doesn’t come with a battery or a charger.Quality hand tools like wrenches and pliers are an essential part of a home DIY set, and you might not even realize how important they are until you’re partway through taking your kitchen sink apart and you realize you don’t have the right wrench. Hand tools are a good gift for a DIYer because in my experience, you can never have too many. Here are a few quality tool sets you can give your favorite DIY home improvement expert for under $100.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA set of Craftsman slip-joint pliers is a good gift for anyone who does vehicle maintenance, DIY appliance repair, or any DIY projects with mechanical parts, and you can get it on Amazon for $22.48 right now. I’ve used my slipjaw pliers on sink repair and also to fix wheels on rolling chairs. This set comes with one pair of 10-inch and one pair of eight-inch slip-jaw pliers with rubber handle grips for a more comfortable grip.The Klein 9-piece screwdriver set is a good quality starter set of drivers and a good gift to give someone interested in any type of DIY, and it’s $66.99 right now on Amazon. Klein screwdrivers are known for their durability, and are a popular choice for construction trades because they’re made with good quality steel and durable components. This set comes with eight flathead and Phillips head drivers in a range of lengths and a magnetizer/demagnetizer tool to allow you to magnetize your screw tip to hold hardware, or demagnetize it for work around sensitive electronic parts.The Craftsman 20-piece ratcheting wrench set is a good gift for anyone who works with mechanical parts, nut and bolts, auto-repair, or appliance repair. These wrenches are especially handy because they can fit in a much narrower place than a socket wrench would, so they can be indispensable for fitting into tight spaces. They’re $66.99 on Amazon right now, and the set includes ten SAE and ten metric wrenches in various sizes.\nBest bits and accessories under $100Bits, blades, and accessories for a tool set are sometimes the difference between being able to finish a project or not, but they can be more expensive than you might expect. If you’re shopping for someone with DIY dreams, bits and other accessories are almost always a useful choice because these things tend to be expendable, as they can wear out over time. I’ve never been sad to have extra bits in my tool kit. Here are a few of the best bits and accessories gifts under $100.The Bosch 15-piece router bit set is a good gift for a woodworker who likes to shape their own trim with a router. These bits are good quality, and made by one of the most popular router manufacturers around. They can be used for edge-trimming as well as cutting a molding profile or adding a decorative edge to shelves or cabinet doors. You can get this set for $94.99 on Amazon, and it comes with a wrench for swapping out the adapters and a carrying case.The Milwaukee 120-piece impact bit set is a good gift for anyone who uses a drill or impact driver for home repair or DIY projects, and it’s $29.88 at Home Depot right now. This set comes with a variety of driver bits as well as some drill bits and an extension bit holder. These bits will work with either an impact driver or a drill, so they’re versatile and interchangeable for convenient use. I like to use this type of bit because they tend to be more shatter resistant when you’re driving fasteners into tough material like the 110-year-old plaster walls in my house.The Milwaukee 23-piece impact compatible drill bit set is a good gift for anyone who installs shelving, builds home woodworking projects, or wants to hang storage in their home. It comes with drill bits that are cross compatible with a drill or impact driver in a variety of sizes, and you can get it for $29.97 at Home Depot right now. These bits are stranger than your average drill bit to accommodate the extra force that an impact driver exerts, and I find that they tend to be durable for woodworking projects.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

I was like that for a long time, too, but I noticed that every time I worked on a project involving lots of hammering, my arm would get fatigued quickly, and the last half of the work would be a misery. I recently fell down a bit of a rabbit hole regarding hammers—the different weights and types-and decided it was time to splurge a bit and buy a titanium hammer (specifically, this one). It was one of the best purchases I’ve made recently.Titanium vs. steel hammerMost hammers are made from steel, with either a fiberglass or wood handle. They get the job done—steel is an excellent material for a hammer, and it will last a long time. I still have an old steel hammer handed down from my father; it has a nail bent over the head at the top to hold it in place, but it still works. And steel hammers are pretty cheap—this 16 ounce model from Estwing is just $25 as I write this. You can’t beat that price for a tool that will probably last decades.\nThe problem with cheap steel hammers is the strain they put your body through. If you use your hammer once a year, you’ll never notice. But when I started doing work around the house on a regular basis, I began to feel it: My arm would get tired, and my elbow and shoulder would ache a little after a few hours. Steel doesn’t absorb the impact of each strike very well, and transmits it to your arm. You can minimize that impact a little with anti-vibration wraps or grips, but it’s never going to go away completely.\nFed up with suffering through every project, I did some research and splurged on a titanium TiBone 10-Oz. Trimbone hammer—and it’s worked out amazingly well. The TiBone is just 10 ounces, but because it’s titanium, it has the same striking force—the force it delivers to the nail—as a much heavier steel model. In other words, whatever weight hammer you’re used to swinging, you can go much lighter with a titanium hammer. That’s less weight to swing, and less strain on your arm.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Trimbone has a few other features I like—you can swap out the face and grip easily, so it will last longer and is more flexible for different jobs, it has a side nail-puller and a magnetic nail starter, and the grip is comfortable. But it’s mainly the lighter weight without sacrificing performance that I (and my shoulder) like. It’s specifically a framing hammer, but I find it’s terrific as a general-purpose hammer for most jobs.The big downside is cost. It’s currently $370.49, which is, you may notice, almost 15 times more expensive than the perfectly good steel hammer I referenced above. You might be able to find it cheaper somewhere with a little effort, but it will still be an order of magnitude more expensive. For me, it was worth the cost—I haven’t needed to take a bunch of ibuprofen after working all day since I bought it. If you’re also struggling with arm fatigue with your current hammer, it might be time to consider the upgrade.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

This feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it pretty easily and start keeping track of the text, photos, and other files that are in your clipboard. The catch is that you need to be running macOS 26 Tahoe to use the built-in clipboard manager, which isn't an option for those with older Macs. Also, Apple's implementation of the clipboard manager is pretty basic, and if you need more features, you're going to have to use third-party alternatives. With that in mind, here is how to pick the best clipboard manager for your Mac.Spotlight search: The best clipboard manager for most people\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nNot everyone needs an advanced clipboard manager. For most people, an app that does the basics is good enough, and it's even better if that app ships with your Mac. As long as your Mac is running macOS 26 Tahoe, you can use the built-in clipboard manager. I wrote about using Spotlight as your clipboard manager recently, and it's been super convenient. You need to enable it by going to System Settings > Spotlight > Results from Clipboard, but after that, you're all set. Spotlight will log everything you copy, except sensitive information such as passwords. You can then access all of your clipboard entries by pressing Command-Space (or clicking that magnifying glass in your Mac's menu bar) and then Command-4. \nThis feature is good enough to get started with clipboard management, but it doesn't sync clipboard history across devices or support features like categorizing copied items by type. If you need advanced features to speed up your workflow, you'll have to rely on third-party apps. It's also worth noting that if you use Spotlight alternatives such as Alfred or Raycast, those apps ship with clipboard managers, too. You don't have to switch back to Spotlight just for this feature.Maccy: A simple, free clipboard manager for older Macs\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you can't install macOS Tahoe on your Mac, or if you use an older Mac that isn't supported any longer, you can download Maccy to get a fast, free, and open source clipboard manager that's just as good as Apple's built-in feature. Maccy is a lightweight menu bar app that displays clipboard history when you click its icon. It also lets you quickly search through your clipboard entries and functions reliably without getting in the way of your work. Plus, you can set up a list of applications to ignore, which means that you can stop it from storing data when you copy from sensitive apps such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, among others. Download: Maccy (free via GitHub, also available for $10 on the Mac App Store, or for $5 via Gumroad).PastePal: A great paid clipboard manager\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI bought PastePal a year ago, and it has served me well ever since. This app is available as a one-time purchase at a reasonable price, and it has pretty much every feature you could ask for. In addition to basic clipboard management, it lets you automatically remove tracking URLs from links, or transform text between upper case and lower case. I also love that it lets you edit items you've copied, which makes life a lot easier when you've accidentally copied a few extra characters with your text.PastePal also supports sequential paste, which means that you can copy a bunch of items and paste them one-by-one. This is great for speeding up repetitive tasks such as copying from one window and pasting in another. My only complaint with this app is that its interface is not super intuitive. If you like your apps to be pretty, you will be disappointed here. While PastePal has all the features you need, you'll have to spend some time digging through settings to make the most of them. That's an acceptable compromise for me, but it may not be for others. You have the option of buying PastePal direct from the developer or from the Mac App Store. The App Store purchase also unlocks the app on iPhone, iPad, in addition to Mac.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDownload: PastePal ($15 via Mac App Store or a direct purchase)Paste: Pricey, but the best clipboard manager overall\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI think Paste is the best clipboard manager for Apple devices overall. It's feature-packed and has the best interface that you could ask for in this kind of an app. It reliably handles your clipboard history, lets you choose which apps to exclude from its tracking, allows you to organize and pin items, and supports advanced features such as extracting text from images and sequential pasting.It also uses a rather simple and intuitive keyboard shortcut (Command-Shift-V) to open or close the clipboard history panel. Plus, there are extra touches, such as letting you view a preview of a webpage when you've copied a link to it. This makes it easy to check if a link is working before you paste it into an app. It's an overall neat and thoughtful app that's well worth recommending.Paste is available on the Mac App Store, but its premium tier requires a subscription fee. This unlocks the app on all devices and lets you sync your clipboard history easily. I think it's a bit pricey, but if you want the best clipboard manager that money can buy, this is it.Download: Paste ($4/month or $30/year; one-time purchase fee is $90)\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

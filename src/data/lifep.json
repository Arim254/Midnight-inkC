Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies. See personalized, AI-powered snapshots Gmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.AI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\" \nGet AI Overviews via Gmail searchGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI will proofread your emailsFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise. Like AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts. If you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)To pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning. \nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app: Gesture navigation: Swipe up and hold2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + OverviewNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.POP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.How to keep your third-party accounts working in GmailIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.Use IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.The IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The third (and newest) generation comes with OTA updates that the AirPods Pro 2 also get to enjoy—but considering the second and third generations are the same price right now, why not go with the newer version? The AirPods Pro 3 are down to $199 (originally $249.99), which they briefly hit back in December during the holiday sales—the lowest price yet, according to price tracking tools.\nThe AirPods Pro 3 improve on already great premium earbuds with new features (like a heart rate sensor) without increasing the list price. You'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" (this also works for answering or denying calls). Apple added a live translation feature to both the second- and third-generation AirPods Pro when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year. You'll also get features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSince these are in-ear earbuds (as supposed to regular earbuds like the AirPods 4) the ANC is much better since it naturally blocks out the noise with a tight seal, but the ANC technology itself has also improved—as has the sound quality, thanks to the new H3 chip, as PCMag detailed in its \"exemplary\" review, calling them the best earbuds your money can buy. You can expect about eight hours of juice, depending on your usage, and another 24 hours from the charging case. \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

California residents have gained more control over their personal data than those in other states since the passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in 2018, and they now have a one-stop shop for requesting that their information be removed from hundreds of data brokers registered with the state (and any that do so in the future). California isn't the only state to enact stronger consumer privacy laws in recent years, but its Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) is the first of its kind. The tool is live now, though brokers won't begin processing submissions until August. Here's what to do now if you live in California—and some options for removing your information from data brokers if you don't. How to sign up for California's data removal platformTo get started with DROP, you'll need to confirm that you are, in fact, a California resident by verifying personal information via California Identity Gateway or signing in with Login.gov credentials. To be eligible, you must either live in California or be domiciled in the state even if you live elsewhere temporarily. (This is based on the location of your primary residence, where you are registered to vote, and which state issued your driver's license.)\nYou will then be able to create and submit a deletion request. You'll need to provide some personal data, which will be used to match your request with records held by data brokers. Data types include names, date of birth, zip codes, email addresses, phone numbers, Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs), and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). You can enter multiples of everything except your date of birth and update your request at a later time—if you get a new car or change your email, for example. While you can begin submitting requests now, know that data brokers won't actually begin processing them until August 2026 and could take up to 90 days from then to delete your data. If they find a match, they are required to delete all of the information they have about you, though there are some exceptions, such as data available through public records or provided directly to a business. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nOnce processing begins later this year, you'll be able to track the status of your request on the DROP platform. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAlternatives for deleting your dataIf you don't reside in California and qualify for DROP, all is not lost—though you will have to invest a bit more time and/or money to remove your information from data broker sites than simply mass deleting via a single request. To start opting out of data collection, download Consumer Reports' donation-based Permission Slip app, which tracks where your data can be found and follows up on removal requests. You can try to manually opt out by identifying data brokers and going directly to their sites, but this can be tedious, and there are a handful of other paid services that will do it for you. (None are perfect, nor do they guarantee 100% success.) We also have a guide to blocking companies from tracking your online activities, which can help mitigate the problem somewhat before it begins. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you let someone else use your device—whether you're showing a friend a collection of photos or allowing a stranger to make an emergency call—there's a lot you don't want them to be able to see. If you're an iPhone user, there are several features you can enable to prevent others from snooping around your device. Use Guided AccessIf you don't want someone using your device to see anything else on it, you can turn on Guided Access, which limits them to a single app (such as Phone or Photos). This essentially locks down your screen and prevents navigation outside of the specific features you make available. \nFirst, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle the feature on. Tap Passcode Settings to set up a specific passcode or flip the Face ID toggle to use biometrics to end Guided Access sessions. To start a Guided Access session before handing over your phone, open the app and triple click the side button. You can circle specific areas of the screen you don't want to respond to touch (such as swipes through Photos). Tap Session Settings at the bottom to set a time limit, disable the keyboard, and manage button press options. Then tap Start. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nTo end a Guided Access session, triple-click the side button and enter your passcode or double-click and authenticate with Face ID. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can also lock or hide specific appsSome mobile apps, like financial apps and password managers, already require you to log in or authenticate with your username and password combo or device biometrics every time you open them. You can also lock down other individual apps on iPhone so Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode is required for access. To lock an app from your home screen, touch and hold the icon until the quick actions menu appears, then tap Require Face ID. Alternatively, you can hide apps so others cannot see them on your device (let alone open them) unless you authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. To hide an app, tap and hold the icon on the home screen and tap Require Face ID in the quick actions menu. Tap Hide and Require Face ID > Hide App. If you need to open a hidden app, swipe left on your home screen to reach your App Library, locate the Hidden folder at the bottom, and tap and authenticate to unlock the folder followed by the app. (Note that some native iOS apps, including Calculator, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Find My, Maps, Shortcuts, and Settings, cannot be locked, and system apps that come preinstalled cannot be hidden.)\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons. The new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCurrently, there's a waitlist to sign up for ChatGPT Health, and over time it will roll out to all users. At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Justin Pot\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        There are a lot of apps on the market that claim to \"clean up\" your Mac—for a price. Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.The free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.To get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.The third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.It's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can read more on the project's Github page.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Of course, a water dispenser should ideally do one thing: dispense fresh water for your pet. The Eversweet Ultra water dispenser, however, adds a number of smart features to the mix, some of which actually seem particular useful for owners of multiple cats.The Eversweet's camera tracks your cats' drinking habits I first learned about this water dispenser last week when Petkit officially announced it, and some of the specs and features are the same on paper as they are in person: This smart dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, as well as a 1080p camera with a 140-degree-wide-angle view. That allows you to see your cat approach the dispenser, as well as monitor their drinking habits. You can either choose to tap into a live stream to watch them as they drink, or check out prerecorded clips saved to the app. Petkit tells me the app even chops up clips for you to post to your socials automatically—if you think your friends and family want close-ups of your cat taking a drink. One of Petkit's selling points here, however, is the health tracking. The clips aren't just for posting to stories; instead, the camera can track how your pet drinks over time, noting any discrepancies or changes. You can see daily, monthly, and even yearly drinking trends, so you know whether your cat is drinking an abnormal amount of water for January. I'd want to consult a veterinarian before definitively stating whether this type of tracking is effective, but I can imagine it might be useful to know whether your cat changes its behaviors—something you might not notice if you aren't diligently watching them drink. \n\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThat doesn't change if you have multiple cats, either. The Eversweet's camera uses machine learning for facial recognition, and can identify individual cats in your home. That health tracking can apply to specific cats as they drink water, so you shouldn't have results mixed between your various pets. If you really want to know when one cat is drinking water over another, this should help you keep track.Eversweet's water featuresWhile some water dispensers recycle the water, the Eversweet disposes of the water after a set period of time. I knew about this from the press release, but it was fun seeing the machine dump the water in real time: The pump that serves to keep the water running cuts out, and the entire mechanism lifts up to reveal a drain. The water dumps out, and a spout refills the tank, only to dump the water again. This is an attempt to clean out the tray, and remove any bits of hair or debris that might've been left behind. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPetkit also made a point of showing me that the dispenser's pump is always running, which turns the Eversweet into a bit of a water feature—not that you should buy one just for decoration. The idea is, cats are a bit more attracted to the moving water than still water, which encourages them to drink. I don't have a cat, so I can't speak to that, but it's an added aesthetic perk—until the water dumps out, of course. Petkit says it's aiming for an April release for the Eversweet, which will be available on both Amazon as well as through Petkit's official site.\n            \n    ",

When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.When it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Soundcore\n                    \n    \nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Because they come with batteries and chargers, they’re a great way to get everything you need to use a new tool set right away, and they can be more economical than buying each tool individually. Milwaukee tool sets are often more than $1,000, but you can get a few of these bundles for under $700 right now at Home Depot.Why I recommend Milwaukee toolsI’ve been using Milwaukee cordless tools for over a decade on a variety of professional and personal projects, including projects around the house as well as large scale decking installations. These tools tend to be reliable and the batteries routinely last more than ten years, even working on outdoor projects, exposed to rain and dirt. Durability is a big consideration when I buy tools; the longer they last, the more economical they are. Because all of the current tools are backwards-compatible with all of the 18-volt batteries I have, it's easy to add tools to my set as new ones come out that I want to try, and as my needs expand. Milwaukee tool bundles on saleThe Milwaukee 18-volt, nine-tool combo kit is on sale for $649, 46% off its regular price. It comes with a drill, a ¼-inch impact driver, a ½-inch impact wrench, a 6 ½-inch circular saw, a one-hand reciprocating saw, an angle grinder, an oscillating multitool, a mini blower, a work light, two 5-amp-hour batteries, a charger, and tool bag. This is a good set for larger projects, and it has many of the tools included that I used for building a large outdoor deck. Two larger capacity batteries is a good place to start, although if you plan on using multiple saw simultaneously, you’ll need to add another battery or two to keep a fresh battery ready on the charger.\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \nThe Milwaukee 18-volt five-tool combo kit is on sale for $299, 50% off its regular price. This set includes a drill, a ¼-inch impact driver, a 6 ½-inch circular saw, a one-hand reciprocating saw, a work light, a five-amp-hour battery, a 1.5-amp-hour battery, a charger, and a tool bag. This set has everything you need to get started doing DIY projects, and it includes all the basic Milwaukee tools I use day-to-day for woodworking and smaller building projects like building shelves. This is a good starter set to build on, and it's very similar to the one I began with more than a decade ago.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Milwaukee 12-volt sub-compact drill and driver set is on sale for $199, 50% off its regular price. This set includes a 12-volt drill, an impact driver, a powered ratchet, two batteries, a charger, and a tool bag. While 12-volt batteries are often underpowered for larger projects, these smaller tools can be quite useful for projects like furniture assembly, putting up shelves, or doing appliance repair, as you often don’t need more than an hour or so of battery life to accomplish many of these tasks with your tools, and the smaller size makes them easier to fit into tight spaces.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.What is the RICE method of prioritization?RICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for: Reach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impactImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctlyConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factorsEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources requiredA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started. \nHow and when to use RICEI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nStart by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit. Next, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But there's a big problem that makes this a lot harder (and more expensive) than it should be: battery incompatibility. By design, you can’t simply pop a Ryobi battery into a DeWalt tool and expect it to work. Engineering decisions aside, using proprietary batteries allows companies to create a sort of obligatory brand loyalty, forcing you to stick with their line of tools unless you want to invest in a whole new set of batteries for every new tool you buy.If you've been building your cordless tool collection for some time, you may wind up with four or five different chargers and multiple batteries cluttering your workspace. And that clutter can be expensive, because you wind up buying more chargers and batteries than you might not need if batteries were interchangeable.But it turns out they are, sort of. You can actually swap batteries between brands—you just need the right adapters.\nAdapters let you swap tool batteries between brandsThere are two kinds of battery adapters to consider:Inter-brand adapters allow you to use one brand’s batteries in another brand’s tool (like DeWalt batteries in Milwaukee tools).Voltage adapters allow you to use a different voltage battery than the tool expects (say, a 20-volt battery in a 18-volt tool).These adapters are a fairly simple solution to the problem of incompatible battery systems. If you have a lot of DeWalt tools, for example, you can purchase a Milwaukee tool without a battery (which will be cheaper) and just use an adapter to plug in one of the DeWalt batteries you already have.\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nOf course, these batteries weren’t specifically designed for these tools, so there can be some trade-offs. While tool performance has been found to be broadly similar (and some tools even performed better when using batteries from different brands), for some tools (like grinders and some circular saws) there’s a dropoff in power and performance when using an adapter. That said, you might not notice it if you're just looking to tackling simple DIY projects around the house. Another caveat to consider: You might lose some features. Some tools are designed to communicate with the battery to modulate power draw in order to extend the life of the battery, and using an adapter will remove this functionality. But again, if you’re simply using a power drill for basic maintenance tasks, this might not be a huge issue for you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUniversal adapters are a good solution if you own a bunch of brandsIf you’ve got a bunch of disparate tool brands, of course, buying multiple adapters might not seem like much of an improvement over your collection of batteries and chargers. If this is you, consider something like the Ceenr PDNation Universal Battery System, which provides an 18-volt battery and a series of adapters that allow it to be used in a wide range of power tools, including major brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, and DeWalt.For example, you can buy a battery with an adapter for DeWalt tools, then buy a second adapter for the same battery that will work with Makita tools. This means you can standardize on one battery system for pretty much any tool you buy (it’s not a truly universal system, since you’re dependent on the range of adapters they offer, but it’s probably close enough for most people).As with other adapters, there can be some performance loss using a universal adapter, but by and large, it’s probably not a big issue if you’re doing work around the house, as opposed to working professionally on a job site.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

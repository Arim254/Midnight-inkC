I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. A number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Windows RE offers a series of functions to help you root out whatever is ailing your machine. Using it, you can choose to reset your computer, run an automated diagnosis and repair tool, adjust settings to see if any are causing the issue, uninstall previous updates that might be tripping up Windows, and restore to a previous back Windows backup, among other potentially helpful options. It's a necessary feature of the operating system, meant for times when a simple shut down and restart doesn't help your PC get back to normal operations. So it's not ideal when Windows ships with a bug that not only breaks part of the OS, but also breaks the part of the OS designed to help fix your PC.As spotted by Tom's Hardware, a bug in Windows 11's October update, KB5066835, hinders your ability to access Windows RE. The recovery environment can still load if you need it, but you'll find you won't be able to select any of the options it offers to try to fix your PC. That's because this bug breaks USB device functionality specifically in Windows RE. Simply stated, your mouse and keyboard will not work in Windows RE, preventing any navigation within the recovery environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is obviously bad news for anyone who wants to use Windows RE to fix a problem with their PC—including, ironically, this Windows RE-specific bug. But you might think that so long as your particular issue with Windows isn't prohibiting you from actually using your computer, you could live without Windows RE for the time being. As Tom's Hardware points out, however, it's not so simple: When your PC has trouble starting up, it will automatically boot into the recovery environment. That's normally a good thing, since you'll have the tools to help diagnose and solve the issue. However, when Windows takes you to a screen where you can't use your mouse and keyboard, or interact with any elements whatsoever, you're kind of stuck. Microsoft has issued a patchThe good news is a fix is officially here. Microsoft had called out the bug as a known issue in Windows 11, version 25H2, and said it was working on releasing a fix \"in the coming days.\" That fix came sooner than expected. The new KB5070773 update restores USB device functionality in Windows RE, so you should update as soon as possible. If you have normal access to Windows, all you need to do is head to Start > Settings > Windows Update, and install it when it appears.However, if your PC is stuck in Windows RE, it's a bit trickier to solve. As Tom's Hardware explains, Microsoft recommends users to use their touchscreens or PS/2 ports if available. If not, you may need to rely on a USB recovery drive to get your PC back up and running.  Windows is experiencing other issues, tooWindows is going through it this month. This same October update also broke localhost functionality, which impacted any apps that connect to services running locally on your PC. (Luckily, Microsoft did issue a fix for that bug.) Then, last week, the company also officially ended support for Windows 10, and though it still offers Extended Security Updates for any user that wants to enroll their PC in the program, it puts the security of roughly half a billion PC users into question.   This Windows RE bug is just one more critical issue PC users have to deal with. Hopefully, Microsoft's next Windows 11 build introduces only fixes, and no additional bugs.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.There are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

While it's supposed to show me what the next big game is ahead of time, the truth is, there are just too many games and too many types of players out there for it to keep up anymore. My tastes probably aren't the same as yours, and limiting the highlights to a small selection of popular picks could bury smaller titles some players might be more interested in. That's why I'm so excited about Steam's new Personal Calendar page.Released last night, it's technically an experiment, but it's already looking great. Essentially, rather than showing you a generic list of ten games like the Popular Upcoming tab (I have no idea how Valve picks those games, by the way), this instead shows you a personally curated selection of recently released and upcoming games, organized on a daily calendar, and up through the next eight weeks. The specifics depend on how you customize it, but already, it's far more useful for me than the Popular Upcoming tab.To check it out, either click here for the web version or open your Steam desktop client, and next to the search bar, navigate to Special Sections > Steam Labs > 016 Personal Calendar.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhen you first open the calendar, you'll see 100 games, split across titles released last month, titles released in the last seven days, and titles that aren't out yet. At time of writing, I currently see suggested games through Dec. 12, which gives me a pretty good window of what to look forward to. If you're eagle-eyed, you might notice that the Personal Calendar excludes weekends, which Valve says is because most games don't release on weekends. If a game Valve wants to suggest does release on a weekend, it'll instead show up on the following Monday.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nAs for the curation, I'm satisfied. Unlike the Popular Upcoming tab, the Personal Calendar uses a combination of your wishlist and your playtime in certain games to decide what to show you, making for a list that's catered to your tastes. Lately, I've been playing a lot of platformers and RPGs, and low and behold, my Personal Calendar opened right up to suggestions like Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles and Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake. These are bigger titles, but there are smaller choices I might have otherwise overlooked peppered in, and it already seems like a great way to make sure I don't miss out on a game I'd like. I even appreciate the heads-up about recently released games, which are easy to think about once and then forget.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe one criticism I have is that the default of 100 games looks a little overstuffed to me. Luckily, you can slim down your suggestions to anywhere from ten to fifty games (at the top of the page, under Game Count), which also has the benefit of narrowing down the algorithm to only show you what it thinks you'd enjoy most. Or, if you want to see as many options as possible, you can also have the calendar display 250 or 500 games. There are also controls to only show games with specific tags, and also to exclude games you've wishlisted or already own.Essentially, the Personal Calendar feels like a personalized and easy-to-check version of those \"Biggest Game Releases of the Month\" videos, except you don't need to constantly rewind or pull up the video again whenever you're looking for what to play next. Valve says your Calendar's algorithm gets re-trained daily, though, so don't expect to always see the same games on it every time you check it. If you see a game you're interested in but aren't ready to pull the trigger on yet, wishlisting it is still your best bet.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        To the disappointment of Judgment Day fans, The Rapture did not happen as predicted at the end of September, but keep your fingers crossed for November, when aliens are expected to invade. This one's a way more concrete prediction than the Rapture. Unlike Jesus, we can actually see the alien starship in our telescopes, cleverly disguised as an interstellar comet. And it's not just conspiracy theorists or Joe Rogan Podcast guests sounding the alarm—a Harvard astrophysicist kicked off the whole thing. So hold on to your butt!The ballad of 3I/ATLASBack in July, NASA spotted 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet about the size of Manhattan, passing through our solar system on its journey from God knows where. This is only the third interstellar comet we've ever spotted, so it's a big deal. In September, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb (who had a long, legit career until recently) published \"News on 3I/ATLAS: Lack of Non-Gravitational Acceleration Implies an Anomalously Massive Object\" which posits that the comet could be a giant spaceship that is going to fly behind the Sun on Oct. 21 (hey, that's the day I'm posting this!), and while it's shielded from our view, the \"potentially hostile\" comet/spaceship could do all kinds of aerial maneuvers, release a squadron of X-wings, or really anything. Then he appeared on a bunch of podcasts and news shows to talk about his \"it could be aliens!\" idea and it spread in mainstream press.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe cranks took over from there, connecting Loeb's observations with the prophecies of \"Baba Vanga\" (a blind, Bulgarian fortune teller that cuckoos love), lies about NASA, Loeb's own invocation of the \"Dark Forest\" theory (where hostile aliens lurk silently waiting to strike), and everything else you could image, then they used AI to make videos about the invasion. So many AI videos about the invasion. So are aliens landing in November?I wouldn't bet on it. If you read Loeb's papers or listen to interviews with him, it's clear he's careful to never make any predictions. He says things like 3I/Atlas \"could be on a mission to release mini probes meant to invade Earth,\" or \"If it’s a technological object, then it might maneuver itself.\" Oh, it could be on mission? It might do something? I could be about to grow 17 heads, and I might release mini probes too. Loeb is not wrong, technically, nor is he lying, but he's not being entirely honest either, because he doesn't follow up his statements with \"...but it's so unlikely, it's barely worth considering.\"And this isn't the first time he's done this.What's the deal with Avi Loeb?Remember 1I/ʻOumuamua? That cigar-shaped interstellar object people thought was an extraterrestrial probe in 2017? Loeb started that, too. He co-authored a paper suggesting it could be a lightsail—a thin, artificial sheet propelled by starlight—sent by an alien civilization. A possibility, but surprise! it turned out to be a comet. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThen there was the meteor. In 2022, Loeb claimed that a meteor that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in 2014 was interstellar in origin and possibly technological. He  dredged up fragments from the ocean floor, and held press conferences about the \"spherules\" that might be alien technology. After sighing heavily, other scientists responded with: \"Sure, it might be alien technology, but it isn't,\" and I hope they added, \"why don't we put some money on the next 'space probe?'\"It's a pattern: Loeb makes a qualified outrageous claim, gets the headlines (\"Harvard Scientist: Comet Could Be Alien Spaceship!\") while hedging enough to say \"I never said it was aliens\" when the prediction fizzles. He seems to be trying to raise awareness about how we think about extraterrestrial life and push against the knee-jerk scientific dismissal of the subject, but the way he's doing it is questionable.Science isn't sexy enoughIn 2025, \"We should carefully study this unusual object\" doesn't land you a book contract and media blitz like \"Could this be an alien invasion fleet?\" does, but it also doesn't corrode public trust in science, and legitimate scientists studying interstellar objects, searching for biosignatures, and working on SETI get drowned out by the noise. And what happens in November? Our Venusian Sky Brothers might descend upon Earth with cake and ice cream for all, but I'm putting my money on the cranks moving on to flat-Earth theories or weather machines, while Loeb generates headlines in a few months with another \"this time, it really might be aliens!\" object. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

I attended MIPCOM in Cannes, France this year for the first time, and as someone who doesn't use generative AI in my daily life, let alone my writing or storytelling, the message to me was clear: Get on board or be left behind. AI is coming for television whether I like it or not. MIPCOM, the long-running annual global trade show for television and digital media, celebrated its 40th year last week in partnership with YouTube, furthering the bridge between the creator economy and traditional TV shows. Many influencers have already made the jump to our living room TVs—MrBeast, Lilly Singh, and others have leveraged YouTube fame as a springboard to more mainstream TV shows—and it's clear the industry sees them as light bearers for acquiring YouTube talent with built-in audiences. But AI feels different. While the gates are opening for content creators to reach wider audiences, AI can play a different kind of numbers game: Like a podcast company churning out 3,000 episodes of AI-generated content per week, most episodes can fail and it could still be a worthwhile return on the investment. One talk I attended, titled \"Infinite Creativity: Storytelling in the Imagination Age,\" put it this way: Even if 99.99% of AI-generated videos are poorly received slop, the remaining .01% is still more content hours than Hollywood can produce each year. Other panels echoed the same sentiment, with session titles like \"Monetizing Content in the Age of AI,\" \"Next in AI: Creative Innovation Showcase,\" and \"Nurturing Future Creative Leaders With AI.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nOne company, LoglineAI, described as an \"AI-led creative studio,\" invited me in an email to \"explore the future of storytelling.\" Their value proposition is using AI to \"deliver character consistency, multi-lingual dubbing with adaptive lip-sync, and emotion-aware visual storytelling, enabling faster, smarter, and scalable content production.\" I would have considered it bunk had I not attended so many sessions highlighting the success of AI-generated content. Like me, you may not know that \"slopcore\" content could be so popular.Vertical video—that is, anything meant to be viewed on a smartphone, like TikTok or Reels—is where AI-generated content has seen most of its success, and vertical micro dramas are already taking off in international markets. These short series typically run one to two minutes, with fast-paced drama often meant to be over-the-top and easy to digest. In one example, I saw a screening of a Turkish series called \"Legacy of Blood,\" a 300-style AI-generated micro drama that followed an obscenely ripped Spartan training his son to be a warrior. Another example, \"Nine-Tailed Fox Demon Falls for Me\" lives in the pre-mainstream gray area where it's both unknown and extremely popular: I had never heard of it and would bet you haven't either, but it's racked up over 200 million views. The plot is incomprehensible, but its nonsense is part of the appeal. In other countries like Colombia, micro dramas have become the most-watched form of TV, beating out both traditional television and streaming services.Whether AI-generated content will reserve its lane in vertical video or bleed into traditional TV is yet to be decided. You may remember Quibi as an example of micro dramas failing to gain traction, but numbers suggest that dismissing vertical videos would be a mistake. The trajectory of micro dramas in the Chinese market challenged many of my own assumptions: Vertical dramas bring five billion dollars in annual revenue, driven initially by middle-aged and older audiences before expanding in popularity on its way to catching up with the standard box office. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Jordan Calhoun / Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nSo should we expect a fall TV lineup to one day feature an AI-generated Spartan falling in love with a nine-tailed fox? How soon until we see AI slop served on our HBO or Netflix homepages? While micro dramas and AI-generated content will increasingly flood our phones, what I expect for TV is more indirect. The TV industry is relying on content creators telling stories, and many content creators are increasingly relying on AI.As TV networks continue to leverage online creator content as a sourcing pool for fresh programming, a growing number of creators are leveraging AI tools to keep up with the churn needed to be consistent and competitive. \"Storytelling in the Imagination Age\" means AI platforms are able to create videos of practically anything, and even if 99.99% of those videos are incomprehensible nonsense that fails, networks may rely on the remaining .01% that gains mainstream attention, like when Hollywood hoped to capitalize on Emojis or Angry Birds. The difference is that AI-based storytelling may not be so obvious. The future of TV won't be nonsensical AI slop, but it may be AI-inspired, and certainly AI aided. And I won't be surprised when I see a trailer one day from something as silly as the nine-tailed fox falling in love, and you shouldn't be either. Maybe the best we can do, then, is learn to recognize AI-written stories. Or learn to care less. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

On Tuesday, the company announced Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration. At the moment, it's Mac-only, but I wouldn't recommend even my Apple friends jumping on board immediately—at least not without understanding the underlying risks. Atlas' AI web browsing\nIf you've already used other AI browsers, like Perplexity's Comet, Atlas is going to feel familiar. In fact, that's also likely true if you've used any web browser before: Atlas is built on Chromium, the engine that powers browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. That means the core mechanics of Atlas are fairly standard; there's nothing particularly revolutionary happening here when it comes to sorting tabs or the browsing experience itself. The same is true when it comes to some ChatGPT interactions. As with other AI browsers, ChatGPT is assigned to the sidebar of the browser window. You can call it up by clicking on the \"Ask ChatGPT\" button, where you can ask it questions about the content you're currently browsing. You can also ask ChatGPT for writing assistance any time you enter an open text field in the browser. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLike Comet, Atlas has an agent mode, but the latter's is built off the existing ChatGPT agent. The idea is that you can task Atlas with performing functions on your behalf. So, rather than pulling up DoorDash's website and ordering yourself dinner, you could ask Atlas to order dinner for you. You can even watch Atlas get to work, and see its thinking behind each decision. OpenAI has other ideas for how to use Atlas' agent mode, including giving the browser a recipe to shop for, or asking the bot to run through team documents at work to generate a brief. Deeper ChatGPT integration is what might set Atlas apart from the competition. If you're a regular ChatGPT user, you'll probably appreciate it having that contextual awareness of your past conversations—if you've already asked ChatGPT about a topic, and you're currently researching it in a browser window, you can pick up the conversation and assume ChatGPT will remember what you've already talked about.        \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAi\n                    \n    \nSimilarly, Atlas will track your browsing and activity history and call upon it in future sessions. Perhaps you'll open your browser to find personalized suggestions on which sites and topics to explore next. Does that sound creepy? Absolutely. But if you're someone who doesn't mind the privacy trade-off, there could be some benefits there. In OpenAI's announcement, it suggested asking Atlas to pull up all the job postings you looked at last week, and produce a summary of industry trends to use in interview prep. If you find that these memories are a bit too much for you, you can disable them from the browser settings. (OpenAI says deleting your browsing history also deletes associated browser memories, and the browser's incognito window logs you out of ChatGPT.)The company includes a setting called \"ChatGPT page visibility,\" which lets you control whether ChatGPT can actually see the webpage you're visiting. If you choose \"Not Allowed,\" you can block the bot from seeing what you're doing, which is good. But then again, doing that defeats the purpose of Atlas a bit. If you don't want ChatGPT seeing what you're doing, you might as well use a browser that doesn't have ChatGPT built right into it. (The company does promise it won't train ChatGPT on your browsing data unless you opt into it, but why would you do that?)Is Atlas safe to use?\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nI'm of the opinion that if the safety of a browser is in question, it's best not to bother with. That's the case with Atlas, as well as other AI browsers. The main issue with browsers that incorporate AI agents is that they are susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks. Brave has done a lot of research on this subject, particularly with Comet. In short, bad actors can potentially hide malicious instructions on websites that the AI agents see as no different from a typical user request. Because the browser is designed to act on your behalf, these malicious instructions can command the AI to do things you definitely don't want it to do. You might ask Atlas to summarize a webpage, but because a bad actor hid a command to do something involving your email, bank account, or corporate intranet on the site, it does that instead. To OpenAI's credit, the company has compiled a list of safeguards to mitigate risks with Atlas. Atlas cannot run code directly in the browser, nor can it download files or install extensions. The browser has no way to access other apps on your Mac, nor its file system. If agent mode needs to access sensitive sites, like your bank, it'll pause to make sure \"you're watching.\" To that point, you can use Atlas' agent in logged out mode, which limits its ability to access sensitive data or take actions \"as you\" on websites. But even OpenAI admits that after thousands of hours of testing, their safeguards \"will not stop every attack that emerges as AI agents grow in popularity.\" The company says it'll patch new vulnerabilities as it finds them, but if bad actors find them first, they might trick these AI agents into doing some terrible things.To me, the risks currently far outweigh the benefits. I don't yet see much reason to have a bot in my browser do things on my behalf, but even if I did, I wouldn't use it just yet. The risk that someone injects a website with a malicious command and derails my AI agent—and my digital life—is too great, especially when I can book those flights or order that delivery on my own without issue.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Other times, the company simply drops the news on a random Wednesday morning. This Wednesday morning is one such example: Following a preview on social media, Apple has announced the M5 chip, as well as three products that will kick off this new era of Apple silicon: the M5 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pros, and Vision Pro.    The M5 chip The big news that unifies all updated Apple products today is the M5 chip. As the name might imply, this is the company's fifth generation of Apple silicon, its custom system on a chip (SoC). \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple is selling M5 as a chip optimized for AI. The company says the new 16-core Neural Engine delivers both performance and efficiency boosts for AI processes. That means Apple Intelligence features should be faster and more accurate, though I'm not sure that's enough to get me to use it. In addition, the chip's 10-core GPU has a dedicated \"Neural Accelerator\" in each core, which offers over four times peak GPU compute over the M4 chip, and six times the compute of M1. Apple specifically touts the improvements for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, which can now take advantage of \"accelerated processing\" for AI tasks, like running diffusion models and large language models. In other graphics gains, M5's GPU and enhanced shader cores can be up to 30% faster than M4 and up to 2.5 times faster than M1. It comes with Apple's third-gen ray-tracing engine, which offers a boost for any process that uses ray tracing to calculate lighting effects. Those improved graphics means the new Apple Vision Pro can render 10% more pixels as well as handle refresh rates up to 120Hz. M5's unified memory now has a bandwidth of 153GB/s, a nearly 30% jump over M4 and over 2x boost over M1, according to Apple. All devices running M5 can access the entire memory pool at once, which Apple says makes it possible to run larger AI models entirely on-device. That's great news for privacy for anyone using AI on these MacBooks, iPads, or Vision Pro. Users can configure M5 to come with up to 32GB of RAM.MacBook Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nApple did something interesting with its M5 kickoff for the Mac: It started only with the 14-inch MacBook Pro. If you want a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M5, you'll need to wait. This new 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with all the new performance gains that Apple advertises for the M5 chip, with some unique benefits as well. Apple says this machine has up to 24 hours of battery life, which, if true, would be huge: You could work two full 12-hour days before needing to find a charger for your MacBook. M5 also brings upgrades to the SSD in this MacBook Pro, which Apple says will help in professional workflows like importing RAW images to exporting huge video files.  Other than that, this is the same 14-inch MacBook Pro that you otherwise know by now. You get the Liquid Retina XDR display with a 12MP Center Stage camera, HDMI port, SD card slot, and three USB-C ports, in either silver or black. It even starts at the same $1,599 price as the M4 MacBook Pro, for the model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. iPad Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nLike the new MacBook Pro, the iPad Pro looks unchanged, save for the new M5 and its performance gains. But there's a little more under the hood here than just the new chip. Apple says the cellular iPad Pro models get the company's C1X modem, which can offer up to 50% faster cellular data performance. If you opt for the cellular iPads, that's good news, though I always opt for the wifi-only model, and use my iPhone as a hotspot. To each their own. In addition to the C1X, these new iPads also get the N1 chip, which supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Apple says N1 supports better performance on 5GHz networks, and boosts performance of features including AirDrop and Personal Hotspot. Apple says the 256GB and 512GB iPad Pros here start with 12GB of RAM. That's 4GB more than the M4 iPad Pros, which started at 8GB each. You'll also notice faster charging speeds on these new iPads: Apple says with the right adapter, such as the company's new dynamic power adapter, you can reach 50% battery in about 30 minutes. These iPads also now support external displays running at up to 120Hz.Vision Pro\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nThe M5 chip is even coming to a refreshed Vision Pro. Apple's mixed-reality headset might not be the success story the company wanted, but it hasn't abandoned the device, either. To the contrary, this Vision Pro has a few upgrades here in addition to M5's performance, efficiency, and AI gains.As mentioned above, the new Vision Pro can now render 10% more pixels across its micro-OLED displays than the previous generation can. It can also boost the refresh rate to 120Hz when needed, which should help sell the virtual reality illusion, including when working with virtual displays.  But it's not just about the technology, here. Apple has upgraded the Vision Pro's headband—specifically, the Dual Knit Band. Apple says this band should be more comfortable, with \"3D-knitted\" upper and lower straps. The lower strap in particular provides a counterweight, which should help take some of the pressure off the user when wearing it. Unfortunately, this strap is a separate $99 purchase. Like the current Vision Pro, this model starts at $3,499 for 256GB of internal storage.All of these devices are available for pre-order starting today, and will be available in stores on Oct. 22.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

What are you putting all this time and effort (and money) into if it's not preparation for the future? One way you can do that is by using “elaborative interrogation,” a technique that helps you learn more effectively by challenging the facts you’re going over. Even if you do only want to pass a test, this can help you understand how the material's concepts relate to one another, which can help you remember them better ahead of exam day.What is elaborative interrogation?Inquiry is an important part of learning, which is why it’s fundamental to some of the best study methods, like SQ3R and KWL. Using those techniques, you outline what you may already know before you start studying, take a quick scan of the material to formulate questions that can guide your reading, then answer your own questions as you go. They're great techniques for making sure you stay engaged and curious, both of which help you focus and actually learn.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWith inquiry in general, not only do you have to memorize what’s presented to you, but you have to dig in and understand it by asking questions. Like I said, when employing SQ3R or KWL, you ask questions before you start reading, so you can find the answers. When you try elaborative interrogation, you ask the questions as you go.Asking questions helps you find answers and establish connections that aren’t immediately apparent in the text, letting you more thoroughly understand what you’re going over. This concept makes sense: When your friend is telling you a wild story, you ask follow-up questions, right? When you ask questions, you're automatically more involved in the process of receiving information and you remember what you take in better because you're getting answers to the parts you were curious about.How to study with elaborative interrogationTo make this work for you, you need to assess the facts of your material. Say you’re studying accounting. One fact you’ll learn is that you journalize debits before credits. You can get by and do well enough on tests just by knowing that fact without thinking any deeper about it—but if you really want to understand the material, it would be helpful to figure out why you journalize debits before credits. When doing elaborative interrogation, you ask yourself these kinds of questions after looking at your facts, so you fully grasp the meaning of it all. Here, your elaborative interrogation is, “Why do we journalize debits before we journalize credits?” Your next question can be, “Why do we record debits as a positive number?” The reason it’s done this way is to reflect incoming money more easily on the credit side.You can even go deeper by working backwards: Why do accountants journalize? What do accountants journalize? Who sees the accountant's journal? What is included in an accountant's journal entry? What are debits? What are credits? Why are they journalized? When are they journalized? The more you understand about the core concept, the more questions you can ask, and the more you can grasp the primary fact, which is that you journalize debits before credits. Eventually, the reasoning for why debits are journalized before credits will be so obvious that the fact itself will be more than obvious. Of course that's the order you do it in, and if that order is all you need to know for your test, you're golden. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo, start by identifying the basic facts you need to know. You can do this easily by writing them down as you go through your text, notes, or lecture. Any assertion or basic fact makes the cut. You can also try using AI, like Google's NotebookLM or ChatGPT, to generate facts. As a test, I just asked ChatGPT, “What are some basic facts to study for accounting?” It gave me 16, almost all of which are great for elaborative interrogation. For instance, the software told me that the International Financial Reporting Standards are used in many countries for financial reporting. That’s probably an answer to a question on a test on its own, but to really understand the point of it all, I could ask, “Why do countries need a set of accounting standards? Which countries use the IFRS?” If you're using ChatGPT or similar, just make sure it’s giving you actual facts; look them up to be sure they’re true. Better yet, use the other tool I mentioned, NotebookLM, because it pulls only from material you provide. Upload your course materials—slide decks, chapter scans, handouts from the professor, whatever—and ask it to pull out the key facts. You can also use the software to generate flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and informational podcasts, but those are for different study approaches entirely. (Try them out when you're done elaborately interrogating!)On a separate paper, write down these questions about your facts, then set to work investigating the answers. The answers may come from materials outside your class lecture, notes, or texts, so don’t be afraid to dig deep. For the most part, though, do try to stick with what you've been provided unless the professor has instructed you to look elsewhere on your own. Ultimately, getting the answers to these questions will help you establish the  connections you need to truly grasp the material and remember it well. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Unfortunately, this is very much a scam.  As BleepingComputer reports, these promo emails were sent from addresses on b.grubhub.com, a legitimate Grubhub subdomain, so they appear verified in recipients' inboxes. Two examples of senders include [email protected] and [email protected]. Beyond that, there are some pretty clear red flags. The subject line reads \"30 minutes left - We'll 10x your Bitcoin!\" to promote a sense of urgency and an offer too good to be true (but also too good to ignore). The body includes the recipient's name and instructions on how to participate in Grubhub's \"Holiday Crypto Promotion\" with a bitcoin wallet address. While Grubhub has acknowledged the problem, they haven't released any details as to what facilitated attackers sending emails using a company address. The company did suffer a major security breach earlier this year, resulting in the leak of some user data (including names and email addresses). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are several varieties of the crypto reward scamThe Grubhub email promotion is a pretty typical example of a cryptocurrency scam. The Federal Trade Commission outlines several variants, including get-rich-quick schemes guaranteeing big returns on your investment and celebrity-promoted \"giveaways\" that claim to multiply any funds you send.If you fall for crypto fraud, there's no way to track or get your money back, and even if victims are few and far between, scammers can score big paydays. That's why you should be especially wary of anything and everything requiring a crypto transaction, especially if the offer sounds urgent or provokes a sense of either excitement or fear. And remember that no legitimate organization—government agency, law enforcement official, utility company, or prize promoter—will ever ask for payments in cryptocurrency.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It was the first time people could wander around a store and pick their items from a shelf instead of handing a list to a clerk who would gather everything for them—typically without any choice of brand or style. Grocery shopping remains a daily or weekly ritual for most people, and it can be a real chore—especially if you’re shopping for a large family. My own grocery lists aren’t all that long, but I still find myself juggling my phone and a scrap of paper as I walk around the store, checking for digital coupons and trying to do quick math. So when I read that one of the local grocery stores (a ShopRite) was rolling out Smart Shopping Carts powered by artificial intelligence (AI), I was intrigued. I’m naturally dubious about a lot of AI tools, but grocery shopping seemed like a place where a little digital help might come in handy. So I headed out to see whether these fancy new carts would offer real benefits or just a lot of targeted advertisements.What are caper carts?The carts in question are Caper Carts, which is owned by Instacart. They’re pretty large and tank-like, and kind of heavy to push.\n\n    \n            \n            The Caper Carts are pretty big and heavy.\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nYou need to have an account with ShopRite in order to use these carts, as they use your phone number to track your purchases; you can choose to store a credit card or other form of payment in there for convenience, but it’s not required. When you walk in the store, the Caper Carts are right there in the entrance area. When you pull one out, the screen lets you enter your phone number, then offers you a (mercifully brief) tutorial.\n    \n            \n            The welcome screen on the AI shopping cart.\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            The log-in screen\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nThe carts have barcode scanners mounted on both sides of the back of the cart, and the cart itself is a scale, which is both how it ensures you’ve scanned everything in the cart and how it calculates the cost of loose produce. If you’ve ever used a self-checkout in a grocery store, it’s kind of similar: You hold items up to the scanners and then drop them into your cart. For produce, you look up what you’re buying and then drop it into the cart, where it’s weighed and added to the total. Along the way, the cart will look for potential coupons or deals you might be interested in. The carts can import your shopping lists from the store’s app, if you want, and will keep track of your loyalty points and rewards as well.How to use a Caper CartThe first Caper Cart I selected didn’t work; nothing would scan no matter how I held things up to the scanners. This wasn’t a big deal—I let the store folks know, logged out of the cart, and grabbed another. The second cart worked perfectly.\n    \n            \n            The  Caper Cart screen while shopping\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nThese carts are pretty heavy, and the second cart I used had a loose wheel which made it rumble loudly as I walked the aisles—you aren’t going to be racing these carts and jumping on for a quick glide. When I dropped an item in the cart without scanning it, the cart politely showed me a video of me placing the item (creepy) and asked if I wanted to fess up to adding something to the cart. It did, however, give me the option to declare a “personal item,” which is a solid feature.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            A video pops up if you try putting an un-scanned item in the cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nI forgot to put my shopping bags in the cart, because I am frequently dumb. You’re supposed to bag as you go, which saves you time; I had to bag after checkout, which did not save me time. On the other hand, I don’t always shop in bagging order, so bagging as I go might result in some of my items getting crushed under heavier groceries, or me having to re-arrange everything in the middle of the shopping experience. I kind of like bagging at the end, when I can make decisions about how to arrange everything optimally.If you change your mind about an item, you just remove it from the cart. The Caper system will notice and remove the item from your bill.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen you’re done, you just tap “Checkout” and head to the Checkout Area.\n    \n            \n            Checking out with a Caper Cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nThis will be different depending on the specific store you’re in—some stores don’t have checkout lanes for the Caper Carts, but this ShopRite did. There was only one lane for Caper Carts, and I had to wait behind someone as they checked themselves out. Then I scanned a barcode on my screen with a gun and tapped my card to pay while a security guard loomed nearby, presumably to discourage folks from making a run for it.\n    \n            \n            Barcode for checking out with a Caper Cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            Scanning the checkout barcode on a Caper Cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nOverall, the AI shopping cart experience was a slight upgrade from typical grocery shopping. Bagging as you go is convenient, and checkout is a little easier because you scan a single barcode instead of two dozen. I didn’t receive many personalized coupons or recipe suggestions because this was my first time using the system, but I can see how that could become very useful if the cart is able to dig up coupons or offers that I missed.A few specific notes:The cart can accidentally scan a barcode if you get close to a shelf, which can cause confusion, though the cart will quickly delete it if the weight doesn’t change.As noted above, the carts are pretty heavy. If you’re going to be buying a lot of groceries all at once, this could become a real workout.Adding produce can be a little complicated: You have to locate the “price look up” (PLU) code for the specific produce you’re adding, then scan or type it into the screen before dropping it into the cart. That means sometimes hunting for those little stickers and tapping a bunch of numbers into your cart over and over again.Seeing your total spend add up in real time is useful, especially if you’re tracking costs. If an item costs more than expected, you see it immediately, and if the overall cost is more than anticipated you have time to adjust your selections before you hit the checkout.Because you have to go through a checkout lane as usual (and there was only one dedicated lane for Caper Carts), during busy times you might wind up waiting a long time to get out of the store, which kind of cancels out the convenience factor. Of course, as more people use these carts, ShopRite might add more dedicated Caper lanes.Depending on how you shop for groceries, these AI shopping carts might be worth a try—but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.\n            \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Jeff Somers\n                                \n                                            Jeff Somers is a freelancer who has been writing about writing, books, personal finance, and home maintenance since 2012.\n                                    \n                Read Jeff's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Jeff\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

When that happens, you can might yourself getting distracted and missing important messages—at least, that's what happens to me, unless I have some kind of plan in place.There are a few different approaches you can consider to prevent this, but the \"OHIO\" technique is the one to try if you need extra help being decisive—though it's important to note that while it can ease your decision paralysis, it does have a few limitations worth considering. What is the OHIO method of time management?OHIO is an acronym for “Only Handle It Once” and you'll hear it crop up in a variety of productivity-based conversations, like ones around tidying up. Proponents say it helps you avoid unnecessary dawdling, delays, and indecision, as it calls for you to handle any task, email, message, or assignment just one time. It's definitely a habit you need to build up to, but it's one that pays off the longer you work at it.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nYou can broadly apply it to what you’re working by assessing your entire inbox, to-do list, or other group of tasks all at once. Prioritize the tasks in order of importance using a system like the Eisenhower Matrix or ABC method. (If the workload isn’t too complex, feel free to prioritize them quickly on your own without a fancy system, but I'm a big fan of customizing hyper-specific productivity techniques to meet my needs.) Then take immediate action on each, starting from the top. Either delete them, delegate them, do what they say, or defer them, using the 4D method.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe OHIO method works great for emails, too, but it can suck you into time-wasting if you’re not careful. Only handling each email once is a solid way not to spend too much time on it, but you have to plan what you’re going to do. Otherwise, you may end up clicking every new email that comes in and trying to manage it in real time.Emails are harder to prioritize than a to-do list, so you may struggle to determine which one you should jump on first. Instead of implementing the OHIO method in the moment every moment, set aside time every morning and afternoon to go through your messages and, of course, only handle them once. (You can use time boxing and time blocking to make sure you do this at the same time every day, plus a 3-3-3 to-do list to make sure you have time to prioritize the task.) Try a half hour at the start of your workday, a half hour after lunch, and 15 minutes just before clocking out. If you base your approach on time, rather than a prioritized list, you’ll still be able to open each message and handle it, but won’t be swamped by having to do that every time you get a new alert. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There are exceptions for third-party addresses, like work emails tied to a company's domain, but for the typical @gmail.com account, no dice. Personally, I've had a number of loyalty programs and store accounts tied to an embarrassingly edgy email from high school for decades now, but finally, it seems like I'll be able to change it.A recently updated Google support page says the company is now \"gradually rolling out\" the ability to change your Gmail address, with some limitations. Oddly, the page is only available in Hindi for the moment, so I've reached out to Google for clarification about where and when the feature will be available and will update when I hear back. Still, the support page does say (through a machine translation) that the feature's coming \"to all users,\" which implies it'll see a global release at some point.For good measure, I checked if I could change any of my personal gmail addresses, but no luck. But once the feature rolls out to you, here's how you'll be able to do it.On a computer or mobile device, navigate to myaccount.google.com/google-account-email.At the top of the page, click or tap \"Personal Information.\" On mobile, this may show up as \"Personal Info.\"Click or Tap on \"Google Account Email.\"From there, click or tap on \"Change Your Google Account Email Address\" and enter your updated email address.Note that these instructions were filtered through a machine translation, so exact wording may differ depending on region. I'll update with official English instructions when available, but the process does seem simple enough.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThere are a couple of wrinkles, however. The big one is that emails sent to your old address will still be sent to your new one, and that your old email may still show up instead of your new one in some cases, like on Calendar events created before you changed your address. That's because your former name will be listed as an alias for the account, rather than deleted. That could be a pain if you're trying to leave old contacts behind, but it'll also ensure important contacts don't get lost in the shuffle, and it'll keep anyone else from registering a new account with that email address. You'll also still be able to use your old gmail address to sign into any accounts associated with it, and regardless of which name you sign in with, you'll still have access to all of your messages, photos, and other files. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can also revert to your old address at any time, but as for changing it to a new address, you can only do it once a year, and only three times total. So no changing it to a wacky new address every Halloween and then back to normal come November.Still, it should be a major quality-of-life upgrade, and should help Google's email service better catch up to more permissive email providers like Proton. No more sounding like an edgelord every time I talk to the checkout clerk at Sephora.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This scheme, dubbed GhostPairing by researchers, uses WhatsApp's device linking process to allow fraudsters to access all of your messages, impersonate you in chats, and perpetuate the scam to your contacts. Here's how threat actors are hijacking WhatsApp accounts—and how to defend yours. GhostPairing manipulates WhatsApp device linkingWhatsApp allows users to link their desktop or browser to their account without needing to enter login credentials in one of two ways: scanning a QR code and approving the session or confirming a numeric pairing code in the mobile app. While the GhostPairing scam could theoretically manipulate users in either approach, researchers found that the latter is much more common. The fraud begins with a short message sent from a contact with a link that purportedly goes to a Facebook photo or some type of Facebook content. If you click through, you'll be directed to a spoofed Facebook login page to enter your phone number—a familiar confirmation flow for Meta platforms. The next screen will likely show a numeric code with instructions to enter said code into WhatsApp to confirm the login (again, this may feel like a familiar two-step verification). If you're not paying attention, you may not realize that this didn't do anything on your end but instead registered the attacker's browser as a linked device to your account. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe danger in this scam is that everything will seem normal on your device and in your account, as attackers haven't hijacked your credentials to lock you out. However, they can do anything and everything in WhatsApp that you can, such as reading chats, receiving messages, viewing and downloading media, collecting information from your contacts, and forwarding the same phishing link. As they learn more about you and the people you know, they can potentially use that for ongoing scams. How to protect your WhatsApp accountAs always, be wary of links received via messaging platforms, even if they seem harmless or you think you know and can trust the sender. Threat actors frequently use social media and direct messaging to spread phishing lures. If you do click a link in WhatsApp (or any other communication), read all prompts carefully before providing or verifying any information to identify scams. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo protect your WhatsApp account specifically, you can set up two-step verification, which will also prevent attackers from adding or changing a connected email address. Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN and add an email address when prompted. You can also check to see if there are any suspicious devices paired with your account under Settings > Linked devices and remove any you don't recognize or regularly use.Finally, if you have been targeted by this scam, let your WhatsApp contacts know, as threat actors may spread the malicious link by making it look like it came from you. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You need a plan. You need acronyms. One such acronym is RAFT, which will literally keep you afloat in the sea of emails you receive every day. You can combine it with others, like LIFO and 4D to maximize its benefits, but first you need to know what to do with it on its own.What is RAFT email management?RAFT stands for the following: ReadActFileTrash.Easy! With this management system, you take the time to read an email first, then act on it however you need to—if you need to, that is—before either filing it away somewhere or deleting it. That’s basically all there is to it, but it works because it requires you to focus on each individual email and make an assessment right away, so you don’t miss anything.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nLike the one- and two-touch rules, this one does require you to open your emails as they come in. For me, that's the hardest part because it's a habit you need to build. This approach reminds me of a more broadly-applicable productivity technique I use often, which is the two-minute rule. When you think of something or are prompted to deal with it, handle it right away. Again, it's a habit that needs to be built up, but I like this approach for all kinds of productivity needs—and with RAFT, you have a clearly outlined series of next steps after you open it up. How to get the most out of RAFTTo maximize the benefits, you should combine this with another system or two. For instance, combine RAFT with the LIFO—last in, first out—method, which calls for you to answer your most recent emails before older ones. If you do this, you’ll always be acting on the most urgent needs instead of playing endless catch-up with things that you let slip by. If something from the past is truly important, you’ll get a follow-up email and you can RAFT then. Otherwise, stick with your most pressing, recent messages and read them, act on them, and file or trash them after that.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes to the acting part, you can call on the trusty 4D method to help you out. The four Ds are delete, do, delegate, or defer, and they refer to the four things you can do with any email. (Delete here is redundant, since “trash” is part of RAFT, but it’s good to reinforce the notion that useless emails should be nuked.) Either do what the email says or delegate it to someone who can, but keep the process moving swiftly. If you don’t end up forwarding it to someone else, delete it or defer (file) it. The main rule of RAFT is you have to do something with every message, not ignore it. As for the filing component of RAFT, make sure you have a great file system in place in advance. If you use Gmail, consider using labels as a more organized archive system, to make whatever you choose to file away more easily accessible. You can label these mini-archives by date, by project, or by whatever makes sense for your retrieval, but be consistent about it so you’re not just banishing all your dealt-with messages to an email limbo. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n    \n        \n        New Year’s resolutions are all about improving ourselves, right? The same goes for your best buddy—your dog. While your dog can’t physically tell you what they need to feel their best, there are simple things you can do to help set them up for success. Right now, you can save 50% off your first box of human-grade The Farmer’s Dog pet food, so that’s a great start. Check out these pup-centric resolutions and help keep their tail wagging into 2026—and for years to come. \nMake the switch to fresh dog foodSay goodbye to kibble this year by getting a subscription to The Farmer’s Dog.

Start by putting doggie toothpaste on your finger and letting your pup lick it off to get them used to having your finger in their mouth. Eventually, replace your finger with the toothbrush.Teach your dog some new tricksWhile daily walks with your dog are key for physical fitness (for both you and your pup), training your dog is a fantastic way to provide them with intellectual stimulation. Teach your dog to sit or some ‘Gram-worthy tricks like playing Bach on the piano, as long as you give them positive affirmation, your pet will feel like the good dog they are. When you’re making resolutions this year, don’t forget about your pup.

Not only do endless emails bog you down and keep you stuck in a loop of endless replies, but the stress of even having to wade through both the important messages and the junk is enough to make you avoid your inbox altogether. There's a reason \"answer emails\" is always the example I use for a tedious-but-important task when I'm explaining more complicated, detailed productivity techniques.But there are smaller techniques you can apply directly to email management, too. To stay on top of your work, school, and personal correspondence, you need a productivity plan, but it doesn't have to be intense: You can try the simple “touch” rules of inbox management.Start reframing how you think of every email you get and consider them each an immediate priority. Crucially, I only mean the email itself is a priority; if you think too hard about this, you'll get overwhelmed fast. You don’t have to do whatever task is outlined in it the moment it arrives, but you do have to open it. The “one-touch” rule is similar to the “two-minute” rule of productivity in that way: A task that takes less than two minutes to complete should be done right away.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nOpen the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. This method works best for people who get a lot of emails that aren’t necessary to respond to, like all-staff updates. The goal is to touch it once instead of coming back to it repeatedly and deliberating if and when you’ll respond or deal with it or instead of procrastinating, never opening it, and being unaware of its contents (or even existence) when you actually need to know what it said. Open it, take in the information, send feedback if necessary, and be done with it.The two-touch ruleIf you tend to have a lot of emails that need a response and the one-touch rule isn't working well, you can move on to a “two-touch” method to clear your mind and be more productive. On the first touch of the email, decide if you need to respond to it right away (making it one-touch) or it’s something that can or should be responded to later in the week.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse your email service’s flagging or snoozing functions to categorize it, so it is available to you easily when you’re ready to respond. Your first touch is still opening it right away—that’s key. Letting emails pile up is overwhelming, but opening them right away will help you maintain peace in your inbox. Designating a specific time to respond to non-urgent messages will also free you up to be more productive, as you’ll know you’ll get it done and won’t feel it weighing on you. Make sure you schedule time into your week to circle back on the flagged emails. Try building a 3-3-3 list to manage your to-dos, designating one of your three medium-sized or small tasks to opening all those saved messages.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Skinny is officially back in—not that it ever really left, if you ask me. Between \"what I eat in a day\" videos and before-and-after transformations, there's always been this undercurrent of weight loss anxiety masquerading as wellness. \"Weight loss\" is assumed to be synonymous with \"healthy,\" but that's never been the whole story. And during this time for reflection and goal-setting, I urge you to think bigger than simply making yourself smaller.If you've struggled to identify health goals beyond weight loss, you're not alone. We've been conditioned to believe that smaller bodies are the ultimate achievement, when in reality, health is so much more expansive, personal, and interesting than that. Here are the resolutions I'm making for 2026—and how to reframe your own goals around what truly matters.Move in ways that feel goodThe weight-loss version: I need to burn calories. Exercise is punishment for eating. Even if I hate working out, I have to do it anyway because discipline.The reframe: What if movement was about feeling capable in your body? About the rush of endorphins after a dance class, the meditative quality of a morning walk, or the satisfaction of getting stronger over time?My resolution: Find three types of movement I genuinely enjoy and do them regularly—not because I \"should,\" but because they make me feel alive. Maybe that's swimming, hiking with friends, or finally trying that aerial yoga class. The goal isn't to torch calories; it's to build a relationship with movement that's based on joy rather than obligation.How to measure success: Can I do things I couldn't do before? Do I feel energized rather than depleted? Am I actually looking forward to moving my body? These are the metrics that matter.Eat foods that make me feel energizedThe weight-loss version: Good foods versus bad foods. Restriction as virtue. Guilt when you inevitably \"fall off the wagon.\"The reframe: Food is information for your body. Am I making choices based on the moral value of different foods, or am I actually listening to what my body wants and needs?My resolution: Notice how different foods actually make me feel, without judgment. Keep a simple log—not of calories, but maybe of energy levels, mood, digestion, and satisfaction. Do I feel better when I include more vegetables, not because they're \"virtuous,\" but because they genuinely help me feel my best?How to measure success: Am I making food choices based on how I want to feel rather than what the scale might say? Do I have stable energy throughout the day? Can I eat without guilt?Stay hydratedThe weight-loss version: Water fills you up so you eat less; it's a diet hack.The reframe: Proper hydration affects everything from your cognitive function and mood to your digestion, skin health, and energy levels. You deserve to drink water because your body literally needs it to survive and thrive.My resolution: Drink enough water that I'm not constantly tired, headache-prone, or confusing thirst for hunger. Keep a bottle with me and actually notice the difference in how I feel when I'm properly hydrated versus when I'm running on empty.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nHow to measure success: Are my headaches less frequent? Is my brain fog lifting by mid-afternoon? Do I have more energy? Build confidence through competenceThe weight-loss version: I'll like myself when I'm smaller. Confidence is contingent on appearance.The reframe: Confidence comes from doing hard things, from developing skills, from taking pride in how I'm moving my body.My resolution: Set a goal that has nothing to do with how I look and everything to do with what I can do. Maybe it's learning to cook five new recipes, or finally achieving my lifelong dream of doing the splits.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to measure success: Do I feel proud of myself? Am I challenging myself in ways that feel meaningful? Is my self-worth becoming less tied to my appearance?Develop a nighttime routine that actually works for meThe weight-loss version: Eating at night makes you gain weight. It's all about willpower, baby.The reframe: Maybe you're eating at night because you're bored, stressed, or genuinely didn't eat enough during the day. Or maybe you're staying up too late scrolling, and food is just something to do.My resolution: Create an evening routine that actually addresses what I need—whether that's genuine hunger (in which case, I'll eat something nourishing without guilt), stress relief (maybe a bath, stretching, or reading), or better sleep hygiene (setting boundaries with screens).How to measure success: Am I sleeping better? Do I feel more rested? Am I addressing the root cause of nighttime habits rather than just restricting them?Feel strong and capable in my bodyThe weight-loss version: I need to earn the right to wear certain clothes. My body is a before photo.The reframe: Your body is the vehicle through which you experience your entire life. What if the goal was to feel powerful, mobile, and pain-free rather than small?My resolution: Focus on functional fitness. Can I lift my suitcase into the overhead bin? Hike without getting winded? Play with kids or pets without my back hurting? These are the markers of a body that serves me well.How to measure success: Am I stronger than I was last month? Can I do daily activities with greater ease? Do I feel capable and comfortable in my body?The bottom linePerhaps the most important resolution of all is this: Stop putting your life on hold until you reach a certain size. Don't wait to buy clothes you love, try new activities, take photos, or simply exist without constant self-criticism.What would your health goals look like if weight loss wasn't part of the equation? I'm willing to bet they'd be more interesting, more sustainable, and far more meaningful than anything a number could tell you. This year, I'm measuring success by how I feel, not how I look. \n            ",

While many gift card scams involve thieves demanding payments—for everything from taxes and fines owed to outstanding utility bills—via prepaid cards, there's a less obvious type of fraud known as gift card draining. How gift card draining scams workIf you forget how much money is on a gift card you received a while ago, you're likely to check the balance online. You'll typically need to enter your card number and PIN or security code, but some websites that claim to provide gift card balances are actually collecting that information to use it later. Always use the official site listed on the back of your card, or better yet, call or visit the retailer directly to confirm the balance. In another version of this scam, fraudsters have set up sites offering to pay you for gift cards you don't want or won't use. They may claim to purchase your $100 card for $90—which sounds better than no money at all—but are simply out to steal the card information and drain the funds, and you'll never actually see that cash. Sites promoting that type of deal are typically not legitimate. When you purchase or receive a gift card, keep the receipt, note the starting balance, and register it with the retailer or transfer the funds from the gift card to your existing account if those options are available. If possible, change the PIN, and spend the funds sooner rather than later. Gift card scams begin in the storeIf you're considering buying physical gift cards in the future, be sure to check for signs of a scam. Fraudsters will tamper with cards in stores by adding stickers over the barcode, so when you check out, the funds you pay go to their account rather than the card itself, which means the balance will be zero when the recipient goes to spend it. Scammers can also record the card number and activation PIN or security code, then reseal the packaging and replace the card on the rack—once the card is paid for or activated, they use the information to spend the funds. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInspect gift cards purchased in-store carefully for added stickers, damage to the packaging, or scratch-off coating that has been removed. You can avoid some risk by purchasing gift cards online directly from the merchant's website (as gift cards sold at steep discounts on social media or deal sites are often scams). And if you do end up with a scam card, you can file a report with the gift card issuer, though your mileage may vary in terms of recovering funds. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a list of fraud contacts for some of the most popular card retailers, including American Express, Visa, and Amazon. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It’s also one of those tools you tend to collect multiple examples of, in different sizes.Typically, you use a C-Clamp to, uh, clamp stuff together, like two pieces of wood, or to clamp something into place while you work on it (I use them a lot to cut lumber so I can have both hands on the saw, as I am allergic to emergency rooms.) But the C-Clamp is actually a very versatile tool that can be deployed in a number of creative—but useful!—ways. Here are some of my favorite ways to repurpose those old C-Clamps.A carrying handleIf you need to carry something that’s bulky, heavy, and awkward, having some temporary handles always makes the job easier. If you have a few C-Clamps, you’re golden: Just clamp a couple onto whatever you’re transporting and you have instant handles to make the haul a little easier. They can also be used as handles for rolled-up materials, like rugs or mats—just thread the roll through a pair of C-Clamps, tighten them closed, and carry on.A quiet hammerIt’s happened to all of us: You need to drive a nail somewhere, but there’s no room to swing a hammer, or for some reason you’re reluctant to make a lot of banging noise. The solution is your trusty C-Clamp: Just place the clamp over the nail head and tighten. The clamping action will inexorably (and silently) drive that nail into place. This isn’t an efficient way to drive a lot of nails, of course, but in a tight spot, it’s brilliant.An emergency wrench\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nNeed to tighten or loosen a connector, but you don’t have a wrench at hand? Tighten a C-Lamp around the bolt, cuff, or connection point so that it’s gripping tightly, then slowly turn it in the direction you need. Make sure the clamp is tight enough to prevent slippage, and you might want to use something (a handy piece of cloth works) to protect the connection from damage as you work.A cord organizerWhether it’s corralling all those extension and power cords on a workbench or work site, or organizing computer cables on your desk with an industrial vibe, C-Clamps can keep all those wires under control and out of your way in a pinch. Just gather the cords at the edge of the desk or table and clamp them down. This is a perfect temporary solution, as the cords can pass freely through the clamps without risk of damage, and the clamps can be removed when the job is done.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBookendsNeed a couple of bookends to hold stuff in place on a shelf? A pair of C-Clamps attached to the outer edge and clamped in as deep as possible will work. This could even be a permanent design choice if your taste runs toward the rustic or industrial.AnchorsC-Clamps are ideal devices when anchor points are needed, but you don’t want to attach anything permanent that would require fasteners and drilling into a structure. Need a clothesline to dry your laundry when the dryer breaks? Two C-Clamps and some rope or twine are all you need. Need to hang tools, clothes, or anything else? C-Clamps attached to a shelf of any kind, combined with a hook, will work a charm. Need to hold a tablecloth or other covering in place? Nothing clamps stuff down to a horizontal surface better than C-Clamps.Spool holderWhether you’re spooling filament to your 3D-printer or feeding twine or wire to yourself as you work on a project, sliding the spool over a C-Clamp and then clamping it into place gives you a sturdy holder that you can pull from. This means you won’t have to juggle your spool every time you need more slack, and you can easily unclamp and reposition the spool if you’re on the move as you work.\n            \n    ",

In this day and age, though, your \"workspace\" isn't always (or, in some cases, even) an office or desk. Your phone and computer are your workspace. That's where you spend most of your work day looking and interacting—and when it's cluttered, you can feel discombobulated, the same as you might with a messy cubicle. It's time to stop thinking only about decluttering the physical world and make a better plan to keep the digital one in good shape. Take stock of your desktop, your tabs, your inbox, and your home screen: How many different windows do you have open right now? They are not only bogging down your mental energy, but your device’s energy, too. Let's fix that—and find a solution that sticks.When to declutter your devicesAim to start each week with a digital decluttering. It doesn’t have to take more than 15 minutes, but you’ll be more productive when it’s done, so it’s a good investment of your time. Approaches like this work best when you actively take the time to schedule them out, so fall back on time boxing and time blocking, and consider using a specialized to-do list system like 3-3-3, then designating the weekly decluttering one of Monday's three small tasks. How to digitally declutter (easily)On your desktop, create folders that can store whatever you need, whether those are documents for work or screenshots for your side business. Each Monday, go through whatever docs or pics have accumulated on the desktop and stick them in their respective folders so the whole thing looks cleaner. Do the same thing with any new apps you’ve put on your phone. There’s no reason to scroll through pages and pages of apps to find the one you need when you can stash it in a folder and keep your home screen organized. Only keep the necessary, daily-use folders available on your desktop and home screen. The rest should be banished somewhere invisible, but searchable.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nClose all open windows you’re not using—and all the tabs left over from your last browsing session. If you genuinely need something available, bookmark it. Get in the habit of closing tabs whenever you’re done with them. (Check for minimized browser windows, too; I always have at least two that need to be closed, but I rarely realize they're running in the background.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNext up is email. I've recommended the “one-touch” method of inbox management before, and an adaptation of it works great here: Open every email you’ve gotten in the last week and either delete it or archive it, depending on whether you anticipate needing it later. Anything you archive, be sure to set aside time to respond to later in the day or week. (Again, time box and time block this, plus add it to your to-do list so it's a real, scheduled task, not just a good idea you may or may not get around to.)Perhaps most importantly, delete as you go. This is the the one I struggle with most, but once you get in the habit, it's easy. If you downloaded an app for a single purpose and don’t use it anymore, delete it. If you have docs in your files from an old class or work project, delete them. Stick to doing this for the first 15 minutes every Monday (or whenever you start your week) to dramatically reduce your digital clutter and any related stress. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I make a handful of new, curated, choreographed ones for the spin classes I teach every week and otherwise meticulously maintain quarterly playlists designed to represent the overall vibe of specific, three-month periods in my life. I only edit those during the 12 weeks of the quarter, then leave them alone so I can revisit them and relive the era. This means I am constantly fiddling with the present playlist to make it just right, searching for songs that feel precisely aligned with however I'm feeling. It's actually a time-consuming hobby—but I stumbled across a feature the other day that has made creating spin playlists and soundtracking Q1 of 2026 easier than ever. The best way I can describe the feature I stumbled upon is that it's like Tinder for songs. If you're listening to a song within the app, scroll down. Go past the buttons for Play and Next, past the About the artist section, past the lyrics, and stop when you see Explore [artist name]. Then, you'll have three options like Similar to [artist name] and Similar to [song name], but these can differ slightly. Tapping one of those opens up the new feature. Say you choose Similar to [song name]. You'll be given 30 seconds of a song that Spotify's algorithm considers \"similar\" to the one you were just listening to, plus the artist's name, how many Spotify followers they have, and a three-dot menu that will let you add the song to your likes, add it to a playlist, go to the artist's page, and more. If you like the 30-second clip, you can add the song to your playlists. If not, you can keep swiping downward to hear a new one. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSee how it's like Tinder? You make fairly snap decisions based on the quick preview and few details you get, then swipe away if you don't like it. I found a community forum post on Spotify's website about it, but otherwise, not much chatter. All I can tell is that it's been out since about May. Why I like the featureI prefer this to the other music-discovery options on Spotify because it gives you a quick preview of the song and makes the finding process simple. I am, of course, a big fan of the pre-generated Discover Weekly playlist or New Releases playlist Spotify makes for me every week, but it's time-consuming to listen to all the songs in them and it's not intuitive to find other new songs based on the finite playlists themselves. The 30-second quick hits and easy, swipeable dismissal of the new feature help me figure out if a song is worth my time, either for spin class or personal use, add it to the appropriate playlist if so, and keep moving. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat I especially like is the three hashtags under the artist's name. They are genre descriptions that match up with whatever song you're previewing and I've found them helpful because I have a hard time describing what kind of music I even like. Apparently, per the new feature, I like something called \"speed garage.\" Tapping the #speedgarage hashtag that appears in the song previews brings me to another scrollable preview pane full of, exclusively, more speed garage—whatever that actually is. I still can't define it, but I learned I like it, and that alone is more beneficial than a year's worth of Discover Weekly playlists. I used this feature during my Uber ride to the airport the other day and, by the time I was through TSA, I had 29 new songs in my Q1 playlist. I listened to them on the plane, weeded out ones that didn't match the quarterly vibe well enough, then sent it to my friends, who all gave the collection rave reviews like, and I quote, \"this slaps.\" \n            \n    ",

These horrors will visit you at all hours of the day, making it harder to spot the truly important messages in your inbox—and it gets worse once you've gotten fed up enough to disable push notifications and they start to really pile up. It’s time to banish these buggers. And, if you're using Gmail, there’s an easy way to do it.Use filters to manage mailing list emails in GmailYou can use a third-party add-on to go through your mailing lists and unsubscribe, saying goodbye to newsletters and e-blasts. But you know what’s easier and less expensive? Setting a filter in Gmail. Open up one of your mailing list emails and click the three dots in the menu bar. You’ll see “Mark as unread,” “Mark as important,” and a few other options, but the one you want is “Filter messages like these.”\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Gmail\n                    \n    \nFrom there, you’ll see a dialog box asking how you want to filter your messages. You can filter by sender, recipients, and subjects, but also by anything that “has the words…” In the “has the words” row, type “unsubscribe.” \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, any email containing the word “unsubscribe”—which reputable email blasts almost always do—can be filtered out of your inbox without you having to do anything. Once you type “unsubscribe” there, hit the “create filter” button. The following dialog box will ask how you want these filtered. You can choose to have them archived, marked as read, starred, forwarded, or immediately deleted.Things to consider when creating Gmail filtersI recommend archiving over deleting in case you ever want to find them again, but if you are sure you’ll never want to open another mailing list, newsletter, or sales blast, feel free to check the box next to “delete.” Note that if you choose to archive but later want to delete them, you’ll have to do so manually. Personally, I am happy to pay for extra Google storage to keep a record of messages instead of inadvertently lose something I need, but I know that's needlessly neurotic. If you do end up archiving those, the next step needs to be actually unsubscribing from the messages you truly don't want to receive. Gmail has recently made this a lot easier: You can usually click an unsubscribe button up at the top of the offending email. The Google-run email service also rolled out a Manage Subscriptions service this past summer, so once you take a gander at the archive full of junk and notice what you're not exactly needing or opening up, you can head over there and nuke your subscriptions quickly and easily. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        Having previously been tested as an experimental flag, Google Chrome's Split View feature is now rolling out in the stable version of the browser (version 142). It doesn't seem to be live for everyone at the same time, but some people are seeing it. (I've got it in Chrome on my Mac, but not yet on Windows.) To check you're on the latest version of Chrome, click the three dots (top right) in a browser tab, then choose Settings and About Chrome. If an update is available, it'll be downloaded, and you can restart your browser to apply it.If you're running the latest version of Chrome and still don't see Split View, you can either wait for the feature to reach you or switch the flag on. Type \"chrome://flags/#side-by-side\" into your browser address bar and hit Enter, then enable the feature and restart your browser. You should then have Split View.\nIt works exactly as you might guess from the name: Split View enables you to have two sites or apps open in the same tab, so you can, for example, dive deep into a Lifehacker article while also keeping an eye on social media. It works much better than just having two Chrome windows up side-by-side in Windows or macOS.How to create a Split ViewThere are a couple of ways to create a Split View. One is to right-click on a tab header and then choose Add tab to new split view from the menu that pops up: The selected tab takes up one half of the Chrome window, and in the other half you can choose another open tab (if there aren't any other open tabs, you'll see the New Tab page).The other method is to click and drag an open tab (using its header), or a web link, to the far left or far right of another tab—you should then see a small space open, with a Create split view label. Getting the dragging and positioning right can take a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty straightforward.\n    \n            \n            Look for a new Split View feature in Chrome.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAfter that, the split tab works more or less like any other normal tab. You can drag it into a different position or into a different window, and you can right-click on it to access the tab options (for muting or pinning, for example). The split view tab will have two small \"x\" icons on it, for closing either half of the tab separately—to close them both, right-click on the tab and choose Close.Whenever you're in a split tab, you'll see a new icon on the Chrome toolbar, which you can click to access related features: You can separate the two views, close the left or the right view, or swap the views over from this toolbar button. The same options are available if you right-click on the Split View tab header.How you can use Split ViewSplit view can help any time you need two webpages or web apps on screen at once. One of Google's own suggestions is keeping a document open while you're on a video call, so you can make notes more easily.It's going to work well for any kind of research or note-taking where you're looking something up and then having to write about it. It may also be less than ideal for our attention spans, because you can load up a video on one half of your Split View, and then scroll through social media on the other half.\n    \n            \n            Two sites open in Split View.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can adjust the sizes of each pane by dragging the divider in the middle, though you are limited overall by the size of the Chrome window. You're also able to switch to different websites within a Split View by typing into the address bar as normal—just make sure you've selected the right half of the pane first.The same sort of effect has long been possible in Windows and macOS by snapping two Chrome windows to each side of the screen, but there's something more convenient and straightforward about having two pages up in the same tab. I can see this being something I make use of a lot, especially on an ultrawide monitor.\n            ",

It's slow, buggy, and lacks the razor sharp focus on albums that I sometimes desire.On my iPhone, I often turn to the excellent Albums app to scratch that itch, which is why I'm excited to say that the same app has recently arrived on the Mac as well. I'm always looking for excuses to avoid opening the Music app on the Mac, and Albums has arrived at exactly the right time for me to make the switch. While I do enjoy listening to individual songs or playlists, I am going through an albums phase right now. For this, the Albums app is perfect. Its sole focus is on playing whole albums from your Apple Music library, rather than mixing and matching songs for you. It goes without saying that this app requires an active Apple Music subscription, but I far prefer it to the official Music app.Play whole albums from Apple Music\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nAlbums is available as a free download from the Mac App Store, but it does have a premium tier that unlocks some of its best features. On the free tier, you can search for and listen to albums. When you open the app, it shows a randomized grid containing all the albums in your Apple Music library. You can click any album to start playing it, and you can also queue other albums to play after the current one ends.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAlbums Premium is available either as a subscription ($2/month or $19/year) or a one-time purchase ($90). If you join the premium tier, you get access to a whole bunch of power user features, such as listening stats, a release feed that tracks upcoming albums from artists in your library, and an \"Insights\" section for you to find curated lists of music albums you've listened to before. You only need to subscribe or purchase the app on one device to unlock it on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.Stats and insights in Albums for Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nThe Albums app's Insights section is a fascinating way to discover music. It gives you the choice to enter your date of birth and generates a full list of collections based on that. Some examples of these collections include \"High School,\" \"Late Teens/Early 20s,\" \"My 30s,\" and so on. If you open any of these collections, it shows you albums (from your Apple Music library) that were released during that stage of your life, which is a great way to take a walk down memory lane.Most collections in the Insights section don't require your personal information, though. Albums will also look at your Apple Music data, and create useful collections such as \"Only Listened Once,\" \"Never Played,\" etc. I also like the \"Today In History\" section here, which highlights albums released on the day you're listening on, but in previous years. Once you open a collection, you can either choose an album you want to play, or use the shuffle option to automatically queue other albums after the current one finishes playing. This is also a nice way to stick to the app's core principle of focusing on whole albums, while still including a \"shuffle\" feature. The Albums Premium tier also lets you create custom collections. You can create a collection of albums by a specific artist, music from a particular decade, or even albums of a particular runtime. For instance, if you're only in the mood for short albums, you can use the app's collection filters to group all albums under 15 minutes long. This is how I learned that the longest album in my Apple Music library is a 666-minute epic (Beethoven: Piano Sonatas, by Daniel Barenboim). I might actually play that start-to-finish when I start writing an epic fantasy novel.Power user features in Albums\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you're looking for different ways to discover and play albums, this app does a great job. It's also perfect for people who love customizing a UI. You can edit the sidebar to reorder various sections, add collections, or even opt for a minimalist look by picking just one element for each section in the sidebar. Albums also supports bulk actions that let you quickly add notes to a bunch of albums or add a set of albums to a new collection. And there are useful sorting options that let you order albums based on release date, title, time spent listening to them, etc. In fact, some of you may complain that Albums has too many customization options, since they can make the UI a bit confusing. For instance, I noticed three different gear icon buttons on the same screen in the app. One of them opens app settings, the second is for collection settings, and the third one is for now playing settings. Power users may enjoy this degree of customizability, but it can also be overwhelming for someone who's just looking for the right button to change their collection's sort order. I also spotted a minor UI bug that displays search results on top of sidebar elements, which makes both hard to read.Still, other than these minor complaints, Albums is a great app that brings some much-needed improvements to Apple Music. It is much faster than Apple Music's own Mac UI, loads songs flawlessly, and does its one job of curating all your albums very well. On the surface, Albums may look like a one-trick pony, but the moment you start exploring it, you'll realize that it has a lot of amazing features for you to enjoy.The developer is clearly is an album enthusiast, and it's nice to see such care still being put into listening to music in the order the artists intended.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The update rolls out a major multitasking redesign that introduces macOS-like windows, a macOS-like menu bar, and a macOS-like file management. The iPad even has the Preview app, for crying out loud—though, to be fair, so does the iPhone.  Apple has toed the line with its tablets over the years, introducing features and functions that make the experience more like using a computer, while never really committing to the bit entirely. To that point, iPadOS 26 probably won't replace your MacBook, but it comes pretty close. If your major concerns have to do with things like window and file management, this update is likely up your alley. But even as this new iPad era seems all about a more traditional computing affair, Apple is going backwards a bit, but in a very good way: The latest iPadOS update brings back a fan-favorite multitasking feature: Slide Over. Slide Over makes window management easierPrior to iPadOS 26, Slide Over had been a cornerstone of multitasking on Apple's tablets for years. While you could have multiple apps open at once in varying window sizes, Slide Over let you designate an app window that kept more of an iOS shape—specifically something long and vertical. As the name implies, this window could slide over from the ride side of the display whenever it was needed, and could easily slide back when it wasn't. It was perfect for keeping a social media feed or a messaging app at hand while working on something else: Imagine having two windows open on your iPhone, one for Safari and one for Google Docs, but whenever you needed to send a text, you could pull a Messages window out from the right side of the screen, and swipe it away when it was time to get back to work. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe Mac has no equivalent to this, of course, as it relies on standard window management. Perhaps Apple thought that if iPadOS 26 also had more of a standard window management, it no longer needed Slide Over. As such, the company removed the feature as part of its big iPad update this fall. It's not clear whether Apple received negative feedback about this omission, or whether the company decided it missed the feature as well, but regardless of the reasoning, Slide Over is back as of iPadOS 26.1.Slide Over is a little different with iPadOS 26.1\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThat said, t feature doesn't work exactly the same as it used to. In order to use it, you need to be using your iPad in Stage Manager or windowed mode, which you can choose from Control Center, or from Settings > Multitasking & Gestures.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFrom here, open an app for which you want to use Slide Over. Long press on the window controls in the top-left corner of the app window, then choose \"Enter Slide Over.\" The app will squish into an iOS-like window on the right side of the display, and you can dismiss it by swiping it away. You can also resize the window into whatever shape or size you want, while still retaining that Slide Over ability. In the image above, you'll see that I shrunk my Apple Music window into more of a square, but you can make it as big as you want—though that might defeat the purpose of setting it as a Slide Over window. How to update to iPadOS 26.1 (and beyond)If you haven't yet done so, you can install the 26.1 update right now from Settings > General > Software Update. In addition to Slide Over, you'll find some other neat features and changes, like the ability to control how Liquid Glass looks on your iPad. If you're a beta tester, you'll skip right over iPadOS 26.1, as Apple is currently testing iPadOS 26.2. The public beta is currently available, and lets you add alarms to reminders for the first time.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I love my M1 iMac, but I worry that Apple's first version of this new update isn't quite optimized for the five-year-old chip, and have been waiting to see if a future version of Tahoe performs a bit better. As it happens, that next version is now here—and does seem improved, at that. Apple has been beta testing macOS Tahoe 26.1 alongside iOS 26.1 since September, and officially released it on Monday, Nov. 3. The update only just dropped, but thanks to the beta testing period, we know what features Apple has in store for Mac users who decide to install 26.1. This is a much smaller revision than macOS 26, but the update does bring some interesting new features for users to explore. Control over Liquid Glass' appearanceBy far the most striking difference between this year's Apple updates and last year's is Liquid Glass. This new design language is Apple's most drastic UI change in years, and while some people love it, others hate it. I've enjoyed the new look on my iPhone, but I understand why some users dislike how some elements let the background shine through, in some cases reducing visibility.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple seems to have taken the criticism to heart: With macOS Tahoe, as well as iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1, the company now gives users the option to control how Liquid Glass looks, at least to a degree. The new toggle, which you can find in System Settings >  Appearance, has two options: \"Clear,\" which retains the original look of Liquid Glass, and \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of your system's UI elements. With Tinted, you won't see as much of the background poke through, and whatever does come through doesn't take over the overlayed element as much. If you find Liquid Glass in macOS Tahoe too clear and \"glassy,\" this might be a good option to try. Expanded support for Apple Music AutoMix Apple's latest round of updates introduced a new DJ-like feature to Apple Music. AutoMix will automatically build a transition between songs, fading one song into another. It's a cool feature (when it works well), and can make transitioning between dissimilar songs a lot smoother.With macOS 26.1, AutoMix now works over AirPlay. Previously, you lost this feature when beaming your music to an AirPlay device.Better FaceTime audio qualityApple says that Mac users updating to 26.1 should experience improved FaceTime audio quality in low-bandwidth conditions. The company doesn't elaborate, but this is good news on its, uh, face: If you're calling someone in a low-signal area, or with a weak wifi connection, you should be able to hear each other better.Communication Safety and Web content filters for child accountsIf your Mac has child accounts (made for ages 13 through 17), Communication Safety and Web content filters will be enabled by default for those accounts after updating to this latest version. These filters are designed to limit adult websites, protecting underage users from content they shouldn't be accessing. A new Network iconAs spotted by the MacOSBeta subreddit, Apple has updated the Network icon for macOS 26.1. The new icon looks great, in my opinion, sporting a blue theme with glow effects:\nA new Macintosh HD iconSimilarly, the Macintosh HD icon gets a small refresh. The original Tahoe icon was a major redesign over the previous, iconic icon. Now, Apple has removed the additional elements to simplify the design. (I still miss the original.) \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nA few security updates, probablyApple hasn't announced security updates for macOS 26.1 yet, but in all likelihood, they will. Apple doesn't often issue true security patches like other companies, barring an emergency patch. Instead, the company usually bundles its security patches within point updates like 26.1. Once the official update drops, expect Apple to update its security release notes to include details about these patches.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But what do I know? The company has announced it is holding its first U.S. awards show later this year. It seems the Oscars-ification of short form video is here.In a blog over on the TikTok site, the company said the show, fittingly called the TikTok Awards, will be held in the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles on Dec. 18, 2025, and will \"honor the creators who have inspired, entertained, and connected communities across the country.\"To that end, the site also says it will invite users to \"vote for their favorite creators\" starting on Nov. 18. So, how will all of this go down?\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWho is nominated for the TikTok Awards?TikTok says it will have announce nominees in 14 categories, including Creator of the Year, Video of the Year, Breakthrough Artist of the Year, and Muse of the Year, whatever that means. But don't assume you can put forward any old channel for an award.Towards the end of its announcement post, TikTok included a \"Meet the Nominees\" section that makes it clear the company has already chosen the competitors—and it might not be anyone you recognize. As someone who has spent a total of 13 hours on TikTok over last week (the things I admit for this job), I only recognize one of them.To be fair, the company says there are \"more to come,\" so it's possible someone I recognize will get added to the list of options. Regardless, it seems like the nominees are being chosen by some internal board, so your mileage may vary on whether you agree with the picks. Personally, I'll admit that a lot of my favorite channels are journalists, spicy comedians, and political commentators, so it's possible they're not showing up here due to an effort to appear apolitical and family friendly. (Justice for Dave the cat, though).You can vote Voting for the TikTok Awards will start on Nov. 18, and the company says you can cast your votes using the in-app TikTok Awards hub. While it's currently unclear how you'll find the hub, my guess is it will show up as a pop-up over your feed when you first open the app, as it did with prior TikTok giveaways. I'm sure nominated creators will also be quick to link users to the hub.It's unclear at the moment how many votes users will get to cast. Some sites, like Crunchyroll, like to let users vote on their awards once per day, likely to encourage engagement or discourage dummy accounts. Whether TikTok will implement a similar system remains to be seen.How to watch the TikTok AwardsIf all you want to know is who wins, then you'll be able to watch the TikTok Awards themselves live on Dec. 18 starting at 6 p.m. PT, with a \"red carpet livestream\" starting an hour before. If you're comfortable watching from your phone, you'll be able to tune in via the TikTok app, but for better TV integration, TikTok says Tubi will also host the program. If you happen to show up late, Tubi will also have an archive of the Awards available to watch on demand \"the next day.\"Can I go to the TikTok Awards In Person?While TikTok is promising \"an immersive IRL experience with interactive moments,\" it's not posting any links to purchase tickets, which means the event is likely invite-only. That's probably important for creator safety, but a bummer for anyone looking to help bring \"the For You Feed to life,\" as TikTok puts it.Are these really the First TikTok Awards?While 2025 is the first year the U.S. has had TikTok Awards, prior years have seen them come to countries including Korea, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. Likely, the delay has been due to the app's uncertain future in the U.S., but with a final deal now reached transferring control of the company to U.S. entities, it's likely TikTok is looking to make up for lost time by amping up its presence in the country.So, will you be watching the TikTok Awards? Personally, I'm not sure they jibe with what I like most about the app—there's a whole category celebrating people who sell via commission with the TikTok shop, something I immediately scroll by whenever I see it—but it could be a funny way to spend an evening, I suppose. So, basically the same approach I take with the Oscars—and at least it should make for some good hot takes on the accounts I do watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Last night, I was testing a pair of soon-to-be released display style glasses that blast out 1,200 nits of light. That’s roughly car-headlight-bright, squeezed into a postage-stamp-sized image projected on glass about a half inch from my eyes. I thought to myself, “Wait, am I frying my eyeballs?” So I called up Dr. Sunir Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at Wills Eye Hospital, and asked him point blank: What am I doing to my eyes with this stuff? “We think not much,” Garg replied. “If the light is not physically causing you to look away—if it’s a bright screen but it’s not uncomfortable—we don't think that that's going to cause any harm to the eye.”There’s not a ton of research on the long-term effects of VR headsets on vision, but the data out there isn’t raising alarms among eye professionals. According to the AAO, ophthalmologists agree that there is no reason to be concerned that VR headsets and/or smart glasses will damage eye health, function, or development. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo close the case, I asked Garg whether he’d ever seen or heard of any eye injuries from virtual reality, and he said, “The only scenario [in which] we've seen eye injuries is when people were doing something like boxing and tripped over the coffee table and fell down and hit their head.”How young is too young for using virtual reality? “But what about the children?” you might be asking (you hand-wringer, you). Good news there too: Virtual reality headset manufacturers may have age-based guidelines for their products—Meta recommends a minimum age of 10 years for its headsets, and Apple says its Vision Pro should not be used by children under 13—but they aren’t based on research about eyesight. “There’s not a lot of data that suggests that the VR headsets are problematic for kids,” Garg said. “I think we'll have to kind of hit [Meta and Apple] up for where that justification is coming from,” Garg said, ”because it's not something that we are really concerned about, per se.”There’s also no reason to think virtual reality helmets cause long-term vision problems in kids, but if a child is inside all day using VR, it could lead to nearsightedness. It’s not from the VR though—it’s the \"being inside\" part. “Something about being outside with natural sunlight seems to help regulate the growth of the eye and helps to reduce the amount of near-sightedness that people could be at risk of developing,” Garg said. So it seems there's some truth to the old trope of bookworms wearing glasses. Exactly why being an indoor-kid correlates with nearsightedness isn’t clear though; more research needs to be done. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nVirtual reality can cause eyestrain, thoughEven if VR gear and smart glasses don’t damage your eyes, they can still cause uncomfortable eyestrain. According to Garg, when you’re using VR or staring at any digital screen, your eyes are not moving much and you tend to blink less, so your eyes dry out, and that can lead to irritation and eyestrain.  “The fix for that is either moving your eyes around consciously, blinking a bit more consciously, or following the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s ’20/20/20 rule.’”  That is: When using any kind of screen, every 20 minutes you should look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.Motion sickness and dizziness in virtual reality Along with eyestrain, common pitfalls of using VR can include headaches, dizziness, and nausea. While your vision might have something to do with these things, the main cause of general VR sickness seems to be the inner ear, not the eyes. “Some people are just really sensitive to the motion component of virtual reality,” Garg said, “It's less clear to me how much of it is from the eyeballs.” Your eyes can handle 1,200 nits because they are toughTo sum up: Available evidence suggests your eyes will not be damaged if you go crazy with the VR, as long as you take breaks every once in a while and blink enough to avoid discomfort. It’s too late for us to save our 20/20 vision by soaking up more sunlight as a child, but at least we're not frying our eyeballs—and it’s reassuring to know that the biggest health risk from using virtual reality is barking your shins on the coffee table.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Contactless payment, also known as tap-to-pay, has become a fast, easy, and relatively common way to complete a transaction using your smartphone or credit card. It relies on Near Field Communication (NFC) to transmit data between your device and a payment terminal when the two are in close proximity, up to an inch or two away.While NFC technology does provide some additional security—transmitting a virtual account number instead of your actual card details, for example—scammers have found a way to capitalize on tap-to-pay to steal money from unsuspecting targets. These \"ghost tapping\" schemes may exploit both cards and mobile wallets. How tap-to-pay scams workAccording to the Better Business Bureau, ghost tapping takes advantage of a potential victim's proximity and lack of attention to detail. They suggest it is possible for a scammer to bump into you in a crowded public space, getting close enough to trigger a contactless transaction without your knowledge. (It's not clear how common a close brush with a tap-to-pay machine actually is.) \nBut other versions of ghost tapping rely on you to actively engage while missing the warning signs of fraud. For example, scammers might appear to be selling goods or collecting small donations for charity using tap-to-pay, but they are actually charging your card for a much larger amount to a fraudulent business. They count on you not to look closely at the transaction details before tapping, or they rush you through the process and fail to offer a receipt.  In one instance reported to the BBB's Scam Tracker, individuals were targeted by a door-to-door salesman who claimed to be selling chocolate for a charitable cause. The transactions were for hundreds of dollars, which the victims didn't see before tapping. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with any scam, vigilance is key. Tap-to-pay is easy enough to feel automatic, and you may be less likely to pause and check the details than you would when swiping or entering your credit card. Always slow down and confirm the merchant name and transaction and tip amount before pulling out your phone or card (again, close proximity is enough to trigger tap-to-pay). Beware of any vendor who tries to rush you, hide the screen, or avoid giving you a receipt. You may also want to set up transaction alerts with your bank or credit card company so you can catch any suspicious charges immediately. If you get a notification about a \"test\" charge, that is also a scam red flag. Finally, while scammers probably aren't going around secretly scanning tap-to-pay en masse, you could protect your cards using a radio frequency identification (RFID)-blocking wallet or sleeve. You can disable NFC on your Android in Settings (type \"NFC\" into the search bar). On iPhone, you have to turn on Airplane Mode to block NFC. \n            ",

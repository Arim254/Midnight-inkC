    "body": "\n        \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Intricuit\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Plenty of people have been asking for a MacBook with a touchscreen display, and now that is possible with the Intricuit Magic Screen, according to an announcement at CES 2026. It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.When it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Soundcore\n                    \n    \nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts. If you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)To pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning. \nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app: Gesture navigation: Swipe up and hold2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + OverviewNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It was the first time people could wander around a store and pick their items from a shelf instead of handing a list to a clerk who would gather everything for them—typically without any choice of brand or style. Grocery shopping remains a daily or weekly ritual for most people, and it can be a real chore—especially if you’re shopping for a large family. My own grocery lists aren’t all that long, but I still find myself juggling my phone and a scrap of paper as I walk around the store, checking for digital coupons and trying to do quick math. So when I read that one of the local grocery stores (a ShopRite) was rolling out Smart Shopping Carts powered by artificial intelligence (AI), I was intrigued. I’m naturally dubious about a lot of AI tools, but grocery shopping seemed like a place where a little digital help might come in handy. So I headed out to see whether these fancy new carts would offer real benefits or just a lot of targeted advertisements.What are caper carts?The carts in question are Caper Carts, which is owned by Instacart. They’re pretty large and tank-like, and kind of heavy to push.\n    \n            \n            The Caper Carts are pretty big and heavy.\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nYou need to have an account with ShopRite in order to use these carts, as they use your phone number to track your purchases; you can choose to store a credit card or other form of payment in there for convenience, but it’s not required. When you walk in the store, the Caper Carts are right there in the entrance area. When you pull one out, the screen lets you enter your phone number, then offers you a (mercifully brief) tutorial.\n    \n            \n            The welcome screen on the AI shopping cart.\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            The log-in screen\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nThe carts have barcode scanners mounted on both sides of the back of the cart, and the cart itself is a scale, which is both how it ensures you’ve scanned everything in the cart and how it calculates the cost of loose produce. If you’ve ever used a self-checkout in a grocery store, it’s kind of similar: You hold items up to the scanners and then drop them into your cart. For produce, you look up what you’re buying and then drop it into the cart, where it’s weighed and added to the total. Along the way, the cart will look for potential coupons or deals you might be interested in. The carts can import your shopping lists from the store’s app, if you want, and will keep track of your loyalty points and rewards as well.How to use a Caper CartThe first Caper Cart I selected didn’t work; nothing would scan no matter how I held things up to the scanners. This wasn’t a big deal—I let the store folks know, logged out of the cart, and grabbed another. The second cart worked perfectly.\n    \n            \n            The  Caper Cart screen while shopping\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nThese carts are pretty heavy, and the second cart I used had a loose wheel which made it rumble loudly as I walked the aisles—you aren’t going to be racing these carts and jumping on for a quick glide. When I dropped an item in the cart without scanning it, the cart politely showed me a video of me placing the item (creepy) and asked if I wanted to fess up to adding something to the cart. It did, however, give me the option to declare a “personal item,” which is a solid feature.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            A video pops up if you try putting an un-scanned item in the cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nI forgot to put my shopping bags in the cart, because I am frequently dumb. You’re supposed to bag as you go, which saves you time; I had to bag after checkout, which did not save me time. On the other hand, I don’t always shop in bagging order, so bagging as I go might result in some of my items getting crushed under heavier groceries, or me having to re-arrange everything in the middle of the shopping experience. I kind of like bagging at the end, when I can make decisions about how to arrange everything optimally.If you change your mind about an item, you just remove it from the cart. The Caper system will notice and remove the item from your bill.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen you’re done, you just tap “Checkout” and head to the Checkout Area.\n    \n            \n            Checking out with a Caper Cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nThis will be different depending on the specific store you’re in—some stores don’t have checkout lanes for the Caper Carts, but this ShopRite did. There was only one lane for Caper Carts, and I had to wait behind someone as they checked themselves out. Then I scanned a barcode on my screen with a gun and tapped my card to pay while a security guard loomed nearby, presumably to discourage folks from making a run for it.\n    \n            \n            Barcode for checking out with a Caper Cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            Scanning the checkout barcode on a Caper Cart\n                                        Credit: Jeff Somers\n                    \n    \nOverall, the AI shopping cart experience was a slight upgrade from typical grocery shopping. Bagging as you go is convenient, and checkout is a little easier because you scan a single barcode instead of two dozen. I didn’t receive many personalized coupons or recipe suggestions because this was my first time using the system, but I can see how that could become very useful if the cart is able to dig up coupons or offers that I missed.A few specific notes:The cart can accidentally scan a barcode if you get close to a shelf, which can cause confusion, though the cart will quickly delete it if the weight doesn’t change.As noted above, the carts are pretty heavy. If you’re going to be buying a lot of groceries all at once, this could become a real workout.Adding produce can be a little complicated: You have to locate the “price look up” (PLU) code for the specific produce you’re adding, then scan or type it into the screen before dropping it into the cart. That means sometimes hunting for those little stickers and tapping a bunch of numbers into your cart over and over again.Seeing your total spend add up in real time is useful, especially if you’re tracking costs. If an item costs more than expected, you see it immediately, and if the overall cost is more than anticipated you have time to adjust your selections before you hit the checkout.Because you have to go through a checkout lane as usual (and there was only one dedicated lane for Caper Carts), during busy times you might wind up waiting a long time to get out of the store, which kind of cancels out the convenience factor. Of course, as more people use these carts, ShopRite might add more dedicated Caper lanes.Depending on how you shop for groceries, these AI shopping carts might be worth a try—but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.\n            \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Jeff Somers\n                                \n                                            Jeff Somers is a freelancer who has been writing about writing, books, personal finance, and home maintenance since 2012.\n                                    \n                Read Jeff's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Jeff\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

Its products offer unique features and designs, and the prices are competitive. Right now, Nothing's latest budget over-ear headphones, which were released in October, the CMF Headphone Pros, are just $79 (originally $99), the product's lowest price ever, according to price-tracking tools. This is a great option for anyone looking to get budget over-the-ear headphones that punch above their weight.\nVery much like Nothing's CMF Buds Pro 2 earbuds, the CMF Headphone Pros are budget headphones that punch above their weight. They are an affordable alternative to the popular Headphone 1 (which will cost you $299), and are the first to seamlessly integrate into the Nothing/CMF ecosystem, including smartphones, watches, and other audio products. There is a companion Nothing X app that allows you to customize action buttons, among other things, but the cool thing about these headphones is the control you get without needing the app.There is a multi-function roller on one side of the headphone that you can roll to adjust volume or press to control the ANC modes, which include adaptive ANC (adjusting cancellation/transparency in real-time) and Spatial Audio (creates an immersive, 3D soundstage for music/movies). On the other side, you'll find an \"Energy Slider,\" which tunes your sound in real-time, instantly adjusting the treble and bass balance. You get an impressive 100 hours of playback on a single charge (reduced to up to 50 hours with ANC turned on) as well as AAC, SBC, and LDAC support. They have an IPX2 rating for resistance against sweat, and there is a 3.5mm audio jack for wired listening.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNothing is well known for its minimalistic design, but these headphones go a bit further by allowing you to mix and match the earcups with different colors (they sell for $25). These are a good option for those looking for a bold style budget over-ear headphones that have great battery life and punch above their price point.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Over the last few months, I've noticed an uptick in people discussing something called \"cognitive overload,\" citing it as a potential reason for a decline in output. The phrase stuck out to me as one of those buzzy terms that has the potential to be overused until it's meaningless—but at its core, it certainly has a real, clear definition that can be helpful tool in maximizing productivity. Basically, cognitive overload is what happens when you're inundated with more information than your brain can process, so your brain just gives up altogether, making hard to focus on anything at all. Here's what to know about it and what to do once you identify it. What causes cognitive overload?You know all those jokes on social media about how a single news item or food product from modern times would kill a person born just a few centuries ago? They're funny and hyperbolic, but they're grounded in the fact that while the ways in which we produce things and share information have advanced wildly, the human brain has basically remained the same. We say it all the time but it bears repeating: We're just not cut out to handle the onslaught of stimuli we get on a daily basis.\nThink of how many times your phone lights up on a given day. I just checked my screentime app and discovered that though it's only early afternoon, I've gotten 150 notifications straight to my lock screen already today. It's only Wednesday, so I'm averaging 213 a day, which my phone assures me is down 20% from last week and I'm quite sure I'll pick back up by the time Sunday rolls around. Considering that a few months ago, I redid all my phone settings so not all of my notifications got blasted to my lock screen, this is concerning. That's just a lot of information to constantly see. As it turns out, text-based info is the main cause of cognitive overload, at least according to one study. Emails, Slack and Teams messages, texts, calendar notifications—the never-ending stream of these bad boys is a major contributor to the overall feeling of being unable to process or do anything. If you think about an average day when you've felt too zapped to work, it probably included plenty of those. Audio-visual stimuli are less debilitating, according to the study, so a Zoom or phone call or a manager stopping by your desk may not trip you up as badly. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nBeyond feeling like you can't even think straight or like you're too overwhelmed to take action on any one task, you may be able to recognize cognitive overload from other signs. If incoming messages make you feel frustrated or detached, for instance, no matter what they say, this could be happening to you. That's actually the symptom I experience most often, for what it's worth. When I'm overwhelmed by too much information, I find myself thinking, \"What do you want?!\" every time my phone lights up, before I even see who is reaching out. (Sorry, Mom.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow I'm battling cognitive overloadAs I was going through the study and thinking over cognitive overload, I realized I've already been implementing a few tricks that may have been helping me avoid it. As mentioned above, I banned my least-used apps from sending me notifications a few months ago. For years, I've also tinkered with my MacBook settings so I don't get any form of push notification on my computer. My phone is next to me at all times; there's no good reason for the top right corner of my laptop screen to be whacking me with the same notifications the phone is already showing me. A few other tried-and-true productivity approaches came to mind for me once I got a good grasp of what cognitive overload actually is. The one-touch rule of inbox management could be useful for you if you find that messages get you worked up. With that, you open each message as you get it and make an instant decision about what to do with the contents. It might seem counterintuitive to face each incoming message head-on if you're trying to avoid feeling burned out by the sheer volume of them, but I've found that when I see a message preview at the top of my screen and do nothing about it, it nags at me all day. Addressing it instantly helps me clear my mind and keep working. Otherwise, the way you go about battling this is going to be pretty subjective, although I do have one more recommendation: If you're not familiar with the Pomodoro technique, get familiar now. With it, you work for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) before taking a small break (usually five). When you're in those focus sessions, you should be completely distraction-free, putting your devices in Do Not Disturb mode or even using specialized apps to block other, distracting apps. Knowing you have to work seriously for a certain amount of time can help get you in the zone and push you away from information and decision paralysis while knowing you eventually get a break can help you stay relaxed as you go. \n            \n    ",

Because they come with batteries and chargers, they’re a great way to get everything you need to use a new tool set right away, and they can be more economical than buying each tool individually. Milwaukee tool sets are often more than $1,000, but you can get a few of these bundles for under $700 right now at Home Depot.Why I recommend Milwaukee toolsI’ve been using Milwaukee cordless tools for over a decade on a variety of professional and personal projects, including projects around the house as well as large scale decking installations. These tools tend to be reliable and the batteries routinely last more than ten years, even working on outdoor projects, exposed to rain and dirt. Durability is a big consideration when I buy tools; the longer they last, the more economical they are. Because all of the current tools are backwards-compatible with all of the 18-volt batteries I have, it's easy to add tools to my set as new ones come out that I want to try, and as my needs expand. Milwaukee tool bundles on saleThe Milwaukee 18-volt, nine-tool combo kit is on sale for $649, 46% off its regular price. It comes with a drill, a ¼-inch impact driver, a ½-inch impact wrench, a 6 ½-inch circular saw, a one-hand reciprocating saw, an angle grinder, an oscillating multitool, a mini blower, a work light, two 5-amp-hour batteries, a charger, and tool bag. This is a good set for larger projects, and it has many of the tools included that I used for building a large outdoor deck. Two larger capacity batteries is a good place to start, although if you plan on using multiple saw simultaneously, you’ll need to add another battery or two to keep a fresh battery ready on the charger.\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \nThe Milwaukee 18-volt five-tool combo kit is on sale for $299, 50% off its regular price. This set includes a drill, a ¼-inch impact driver, a 6 ½-inch circular saw, a one-hand reciprocating saw, a work light, a five-amp-hour battery, a 1.5-amp-hour battery, a charger, and a tool bag. This set has everything you need to get started doing DIY projects, and it includes all the basic Milwaukee tools I use day-to-day for woodworking and smaller building projects like building shelves. This is a good starter set to build on, and it's very similar to the one I began with more than a decade ago.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Milwaukee 12-volt sub-compact drill and driver set is on sale for $199, 50% off its regular price. This set includes a 12-volt drill, an impact driver, a powered ratchet, two batteries, a charger, and a tool bag. While 12-volt batteries are often underpowered for larger projects, these smaller tools can be quite useful for projects like furniture assembly, putting up shelves, or doing appliance repair, as you often don’t need more than an hour or so of battery life to accomplish many of these tasks with your tools, and the smaller size makes them easier to fit into tight spaces.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.Hardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.I suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field). \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear. What is CES?Billing itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future. Where and when is CES 2026?CES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9.  The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas. \nWhat brands are attending CES 2026?Most major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:Samsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.LG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.Sony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility. It's unveiling the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) and showcasing the AFEELA electric vehicle Prototype.TCL: It's not CES without new TVs, and TCL is showing off a gigantic set with a SQD-Mini LED display. Panasonic: Under the banner \"The future we make,\" Panasonic promises it is \"leveraging the power of AI to amplify the impact of our human-centric technologies, services and solutions.\"NVIDIA: The chip-maker is showcasing its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer platform, the Alpamayo reasoning model for self-driving vehicles, and more.AMD: AMD is unveiling the Ryzen AI processors for PCs and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming.Intel: Intel launched its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed \"Panther Lake.\"Uber: Transportation firm Uber wants you to know about its new robotaxi.The LEGO Group: Lovable toy makers LEGO announced \"Smart Bricks,\" packed with a tiny processor that \"brings play to life.\"Ikea: Making its first appearance at CES, Swedish furniture retailer Ikea unveiled 21 new smart home products. In fact, so many brands exhibit at CES, it's more notable which ones aren't there. This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon. The biggest stories of CES 2026 so farAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far. At its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla. HP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor. Hyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.  Broadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.

    "body": "\n        \n        There are many good reasons to get a VPN (Virtual Private Network) app installed on your phone or laptop: They make it harder for anyone else to track your browsing, they keep your data safe when you're on public wifi networks, and they even let you spoof your location so you can access geolocation-locked content.You'll also find plenty of choice when it comes to VPNs. Our own guides to the best paid VPNs and the best free VPNs show the wealth of impressive apps out there, and even when you narrow down the criteria, you've still got lots of options to pick from—see our recommendations for the best free VPNs for Android.So what exactly should you be looking for when it comes to choosing the right VPN for you? These are the features and selling points that you'll see mentioned when you're browsing VPN comparisons, and what they mean (and once you've built up a shortlist from these criteria, then you can look at the prices and extras).\nBrowsing speedOne of the downsides of loading up a VPN is that your browsing speed can suffer, while your data gets pinged around multiple servers across the globe. Ideally, you want all the protection that a VPN offers, without too much of a hit on download and upload rates (no matter how many other people are using the same VPN).Unfortunately, this isn't really something you can gauge just by looking at VPN listings and ads, as most VPNs will claim to be the fastest. Either read benchmark tests put together by publications and authors you trust (watch out for sponsored content), or make use of as many free trials as you can and do some testing yourself.Server locations\n    \n            \n            Even VPN service will tell you how many servers it has, and where they are.\n                                        Credit: ExpressVPN\n                    \n    \nYour VPN of choice needs to reroute your internet traffic somewhere, and how many servers a particular VPN has around the world can make a substantial difference to speed and availability. It's also going to determine where in the world you can pretend to be of course, if you want to jump to another country virtually.Broadly speaking, the more servers the better, though as with VPN speeds you may have to do some testing of your own to check reliability and transfer rates. Look for server locations close to you (for speed), and outside of heavily censored or surveilled countries (for privacy), and check any technical specs that are given for them.Split tunneling and kill switchesSomething else to look out for is split tunneling, or the ability to send only some of your internet traffic through a VPN. This means you get better speeds (and less security and privacy) on data that's not so important, if you're just reading the news or learning a language. It's a feature that many of the best VPNs now offer.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nAnother feature worth checking for is a kill switch. It sounds rather dramatic, but it's simply a feature that shuts down your internet connection if the data encryption somehow fails—cutting you off from the internet, but preventing your connection and data from being exposed. Again, this is now fairly common, but not every VPN offers it.No logs or zero logs\n    \n            \n            Mullvad VPN lets you pay by cash, if you don't want to enter payment info.\n                                        Credit: Mullvad VPN\n                    \n    \nYou should only consider VPNs that have clear no-logs policies (no browsing data is permanently retained) or zero-logs policies (supposedly even stricter, covering more data). Don't take the VPN's word for it. though: Look for third-party audits from independent security companies, carried out regularly, to verify these claims.If these logs are retained, they might be sold to data brokers, or pulled by law enforcement agencies—so check the individual privacy policies for details of what happens when you're connected to your VPN. Some VPNs go above and beyond when it comes to letting you stay anonymous: Mullvad VPN lets you pay by cash through the post, for example.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nVPN protocolA VPN protocol is the way that the VPN connects to the internet at large: It makes a major difference to speed and security, and you'll often see it mentioned in VPN listings. However, as important as it is, it's not something that's easy to compare across different VPN services—most VPNs will simply say their protocol of choice is the best.Once you've got a shortlist of VPNs together, do some background reading on the protocols they use: Look for independent assessments of their security and transparency, technical benchmarks, and protocols that have been open sourced so they can be analyzed. OpenVPN and WireGuard are two well-regarded protocols, for example.Location and reputation\n    \n            \n            Where a VPN is based is important, as well as where it connects to.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nVPN companies are bound by the laws and regulations of the country that they're based in—so it's a good idea to look for ones based in places where surveillance regulation and government monitoring is less strict. If necessary, check the VPN's policies on how it deals with data requests from the authorities and law enforcement in its local region.It's also worth weighinga VPN company's reputation: How does it make money? What other services does it offer? What's its record with data breaches? This is much more important with a VPN than it is with your streaming music provider, for example, because you're trusting it with all of your online data while you're connected.Trials and money backGenerally speaking, it's worth paying for a VPN, as you're giving it so much responsibility in terms of your online access and security. The paid options are almost always going to give you a faster and more reliable service, and if you regularly make use of a VPN then the monthly fee is well worth the investment.It is, however, worth looking for services that offer free trials and your money back if you're not satisfied (usually after 30 days). Not only does it reflect well on the VPN company, it means you can see if the VPN suits your needs—and check how fast its servers are—before signing up for any kind of payment plan.\n            ",

As a dog owner, I know I don't. But fires do happen, and pets can't follow your family fire plan. Rescue Retriever wants to change that. I spoke with the company during CES' Pepcom event, and learned how it's working to make it easier for firefighters to find your pets in the event of a fire. (Rescue Retriever first launched back in March of 2024. The company was started by two brothers—one of whom is a former firefighter.)During a fire, pets tend to run to where they feel safe—maybe that's under the bed, or somewhere tucked away in a room. That makes it difficult for firefighters to locate pets during an emergency: In a situation where seconds count, they don't have the ability to search every corner of a burning home. Unfortunately, as a result, pets sometimes don't make it out. Rescue Retriever wants to change that.Rescue Retriever's smoke detector is installed near your pet's safe spaceIn an attempt to solve that problem, Rescue Retriever's smoke detector works a bit differently. It isn't supposed to be placed where your current smoke detector is; rather, the idea is to place it where your pet is most likely to go when scared. If you know they like to hide under your bed, for example, you can place the detector there. Once the device detects smoke during a fire, a bright light begins to strobe inside, spread out by a mix of holes placed throughout the device. (Even under the bright lights of Pepcom, the strobe looked intense to me.) That way, firefighters can look out for the strobing lights when trying to locate pets in your home. There's even an accompanying sticker you can place on your home's window, so firefighters know you have a pet to look out for.\n\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe device is silent, so as to not scare your pets away from their hiding space. It wouldn't do any good to have a beacon for firefighters to locate your pet, only to have them scurry off because of an alarm. The Rescue Retriever Fire Tag lights up in an emergency\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNew from the company this year is the Fire Tag, which brings the strobe light from the main unit to a small tag you can place on your pet's collar. The tag syncs up to the main unit using RFID. When the main unit detect smoke and starts strobing, the Fire Tag will pick up the signal and follow suit. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's great that the main unit doesn't make a noise to scare your dog, but that doesn't guarantee they will go to the spot where the smoke alarm is installed—maybe the house smoke alarm scares them again or they don't follow their usual pattern and hide somewhere away from where you placed the main unit. Having a Fire Tag on their collar would give firefighters a better shot at locating the pet, wherever they may be in the home. Rescue Retriever tells me these tags have a range of up to a quarter mile, so if your dog runs away from your house, their collar might still light up. Even still, the Fire Tag opens up, allowing you to place a tracker like an AirTag inside, so if your dog runs out of that quarter mile range, you can still track them if they come within Bluetooth range of a device within the Find My network.  Rescue Retriever says the Fire Tag is ready for production, and, when available, can be purchased either individually ($29.99), or as part of a larger bundle with the main Rescue Retriever unit ($89.99). The main unit can be purchased now for $39.99, but it also comes in bundles with accessories for varying prices.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove. iGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.Why this is aging-in-place techA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on. \nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.The device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.Why radar is involvedA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.I’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00. Other monitoring and safety featuresBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running. The device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.While a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.Update 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove. \n            \n    ",

There are exceptions for third-party addresses, like work emails tied to a company's domain, but for the typical @gmail.com account, no dice. Personally, I've had a number of loyalty programs and store accounts tied to an embarrassingly edgy email from high school for decades now, but finally, it seems like I'll be able to change it.A recently updated Google support page says the company is now \"gradually rolling out\" the ability to change your Gmail address, with some limitations. Oddly, the page is only available in Hindi for the moment, so I've reached out to Google for clarification about where and when the feature will be available and will update when I hear back. Still, the support page does say (through a machine translation) that the feature's coming \"to all users,\" which implies it'll see a global release at some point.For good measure, I checked if I could change any of my personal gmail addresses, but no luck. But once the feature rolls out to you, here's how you'll be able to do it.\nOn a computer or mobile device, navigate to myaccount.google.com/google-account-email.At the top of the page, click or tap \"Personal Information.\" On mobile, this may show up as \"Personal Info.\"Click or Tap on \"Google Account Email.\"From there, click or tap on \"Change Your Google Account Email Address\" and enter your updated email address.Note that these instructions were filtered through a machine translation, so exact wording may differ depending on region. I'll update with official English instructions when available, but the process does seem simple enough.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThere are a couple of wrinkles, however. The big one is that emails sent to your old address will still be sent to your new one, and that your old email may still show up instead of your new one in some cases, like on Calendar events created before you changed your address. That's because your former name will be listed as an alias for the account, rather than deleted. That could be a pain if you're trying to leave old contacts behind, but it'll also ensure important contacts don't get lost in the shuffle, and it'll keep anyone else from registering a new account with that email address. You'll also still be able to use your old gmail address to sign into any accounts associated with it, and regardless of which name you sign in with, you'll still have access to all of your messages, photos, and other files. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can also revert to your old address at any time, but as for changing it to a new address, you can only do it once a year, and only three times total. So no changing it to a wacky new address every Halloween and then back to normal come November.Still, it should be a major quality-of-life upgrade, and should help Google's email service better catch up to more permissive email providers like Proton.

At a press event, I met a woman with macular degeneration, Liz Baker, who uses them daily—and I got to try them myself. What eSight Go is, and how it works\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nThe device is called eSight Go. It’s a headset with little screens in front of your eyes, sort of like a VR headset, but small enough to perch on your nose. The device’s battery pack sits around the back of your neck, so that you don’t have to support the weight of the battery on your head. The glasses are bulky, but the battery pack design made them comfortable for me to wear. The device is designed for people with central vision loss, which includes conditions like macular degeneration. In these conditions, the middle of the person’s visual field isn’t clear—things they look directly at appear blurry or simply aren’t visible, but their peripheral vision is still clear.\nRegular eyewear can’t correct this issue, since the information in the center of the visual field just isn’t there. But the eSight device works by zooming in so much that the person’s peripheral vision is able to process what they’re seeing, and that central “blind spot” essentially disappears. The company’s studies show that people gain seven lines of improvement on vision charts—that’s huge.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nIt’s hard for me, as a sighted person, to know exactly what that’s like, but Baker gave me a few examples. With the device, she can read ingredient labels and see people’s facial features; without it, those things are literally a blur. She told me about noticing her daughter’s freckles when looking through the eSight device, and using it to shop without help. (Previously, small text at stores was impossible to read; she says she kept buying shampoo when she meant to buy conditioner.) Practical use\n    \n            \n            The battery pack, left, sits over your shoulders and attaches to the headset with a short cable.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nThe device has a dizzying array of features that I wasn’t able to master in my short time with it. To name a few: You can zoom in and out with buttons on the arm of the headset, or with a handheld remote. You can increase the contrast of whatever you're looking at. You can freeze-frame, zoom in, and then move your head to read the enlarged image as if it were a giant billboard in front of you (even if it’s something small or far away, like a brochure in your hand or a menu on a restaurant wall.) The device costs $4,950 and is not covered by most insurance. It comes with access to a “coach” who is themselves an eSight user with vision loss who can talk new users through learning the features or helping them to figure out how to do specific tasks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe battery life on the eSight Go is about four hours, so I asked Baker how she keeps the device charged throughout the day. She says she doesn’t wear the glasses continuously, which saves battery life. She keeps them around her neck (essentially in a sleep mode) when she isn’t actively using them to read text or look at a specific thing in detail.Director of sales Roland Mattern says people who test the glasses sometimes zoom all the way in and note that the image can be pixelated, but most users don’t need the max zoom level, and those who do tend to find that it’s still an improvement over what they can see without the glasses. The hefty price isn’t usually covered by insurance, although the Department of Veterans Affairs will cover it, and Mattern says a few users with other insurance companies have sometimes managed to get coverage. Sometimes other programs can cover it, like state-run vocational rehabilitation programs that help people with disabilities return to work. \n            \n    ",

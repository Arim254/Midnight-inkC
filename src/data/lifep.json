Sora</a>, OpenAI's AI video generator. Sora's initial rollout promised hyper-realistic videos that, while exciting to some, terrified me. While AI fans see a future of AI-generated movies and shows, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">I see a future where no one can tell what's real or fake</a>. To me, the only destination for this technology is mass disinformation.</p><p>In the year and a half since, these AI-generated videos haven't only become more realistic; they've also become more accessible, as companies like Google <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-veo-3-ai-tool-videos\" target=\"_blank\">make their tools readily available to anyone willing to pay</a>. That's the situation we find ourselves in with OpenAI's latest announcements: <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Sora 2</a>, a new AI model for generating video with audio, as well as a new Sora app for creating and sharing your AI-generated products. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"sora-2\">Sora 2</h2>\n<p>OpenAI is marketing Sora 2 as a massive upgrade over Sora—comparing the two to GPT-3.5 and GPT-1, respectively. The company says the new model can generate complex videos that earlier models could not. That includes, specifically, an Olympic gymnastic routine; a man performing a backflip on a paddleboard that \"accurately\" models water physics; as well as a skater performing a triple axel with a cat on their shoulder.  </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1973083840689156207\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-know-if-the-video-youre-watching-was-made-with-ai\" target=\"_blank\">One common flaw with AI video models</a> is their lack of understanding of real-world physics. The visual might look realistic, but elements may morph together randomly, while others may disappear and reappear without rhyme or reason. OpenAI says Sora 2 doesn't make these mistakes as often. A basketball that misses the hoop won't magically reappear there; it will, instead, bounce off the backboard as you'd expect it to. The company warns the model is still imperfect, but is improved. Building on this, the model is better at continuity across different shots: Taking OpenAI at their word, your videos should maintain consistency between takes, and you should be able to dictate different types of styles, including \"realistic,\" \"cinematic,\" and \"anime.\"    </p><p>Perhaps the biggest leap with Sora 2 is the ability to add real world elements into the model, a feature OpenAI calls \"Cameo.\" You can put real people into the Sora 2 model, and ask the AI to generate them into any video you want. OpenAI shows a number of examples of their staff adding themselves to various videos, and while the quality is inconsistent, it's a gargantuan leap from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfOBL95qISc&list=PL0_pG0RoJ9h4e1JGm3um4MIYnIKrUImll\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the days of JibJab</a>.   </p><p>Like Google's Veo 3 model, Sora 2 can generate video with realistic audio. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaoWKvcJP0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">The announcement video</a> shows this off: An elephant roars; a skater swooshes on the ice; water splashes on the ground. But, more impressively (and concerningly), people <em>speak</em>. An AI-generated Sam Altman explains the new model and app in this video, and while it's rather obvious to those of us in the know that this is AI, I can imagine <em>many</em> people would have no idea this isn't the real Altman in the clip. </p><h2 id=\"sora-app\">Sora app</h2><p>OpenAI says the Sora app came about as a \"natural evolution of communication.\" The company sees this as a way for people to create and remix other users' AI generations, especially with the ability to upload your own face and likeness to the model.</p><p>At the moment, the app is invite-only, though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sora-by-openai/id6744034028\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you can download it for free from the App Store today</a>. You can get a sense for the experience, however, from both the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzneGhpXwjU\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">demo video</a> OpenAI dropped on Tuesday, as well as posts from the people who already have access.</p>\n<p>This first example OpenAI demos is of a dual Cameo of OpenAI research scientist Bill Peebles and Sam Altman. The video contains an establishing shot of the two men having a conversation, which cuts to a close up of Peebles speaking rapidly about the app's revenue, then to a close up of Altman taking in the rant, before closing on the original establishing shot. On the surface, it's the type of video you might expect to scroll past on a TikTok or Reels binge—but this video is entirely AI-generated.</p><p>The OpenAI staff show off a series of other pre-generated examples, including a Cameo that turns into a cartoon, another that switches the effect to anime, and another that generates a \"news\" report of one of the staff member's addiction to ketchup. (That last one is quite gross, I might add.) They also demonstrate remixing videos you find in the feed, as you're able to prompt Sora to adjust the video however you want. One video shows Peebles in an \"ad\" for a Sora 2 cologne, but others have remixed it to be of toothpaste instead, or entirely in Korean. </p><p>These videos are quite realistic: In one, you think you're simply watching a clip of a tennis match, but it turns out to be a Cameo with OpenAI's Rohan Sahai. After \"Sahai\" wins the match, the video cuts to his \"interview,\" in which he thanks the haters. Others are more obviously AI—though, again, not enough so that most people scrolling by may notice. </p><h2 id=\"safety-and-security-according-to-openai\">Safety and security, according to OpenAI</h2><p>Cameos sound like a privacy and security nightmare, though OpenAI has some protections in place. You can't simply use anyone's face for any videos, and you're only able to upload your own face to the platform. Setting up the Cameo feature on the app is straightforward, if not extremely off-putting. The app will scan your face, sort of like setting up Face ID on an iPhone, and will then send the data to OpenAI's \"systems,\" for \"tons of validation\" to block impersonators, or users who might want to create Cameos of you without your consent. Once approved, you choose who can create Cameos of yourself, including all users, friends, users you specifically approve, or just you. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>As for videos themselves, the Sora app applies a visible watermark to any clip exported out of the app. If you've seen any of these videos on the internet already, you'll notice a small \"Sora\" stamp on each, similar to the watermark you see on TikTok clips exported to other platforms. There are also reasoning models under the hood to block users from generating \"harmful\" content, especially with respect to Cameos. </p><p>If you're a teen using the Sora app, you won't be able to scroll forever. After scrolling for a while, there will be a cooldown period to keep you from spending hours scrolling through these AI videos. While adult accounts won't have this restriction, the app will \"nudge\" you to take a break.  </p><h2 id=\"who-asked-for-this\">Who asked for this?</h2><p>With all due respect to OpenAI and its safety team, this app sounds like it's going to be a disaster, for so many reasons. </p><p>For one, OpenAI has made it as easy to generate hyper-realistic short-form videos as it is to ask Siri about the weather. I appreciate that these videos all come with watermarks, but it won't take much skill to edit those out—at least in a way that most people won't notice. As soon as this is widely available, all of our social media feeds will be plagued with this content. And, seeing as much of it comes with video <em>and</em> audio that are quite realistic, a lot of people are going to be fooled by a <em>lot</em> of content. </p><p>It's bad enough when that involves silly videos, <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/bunnies-jumping-trampoline-viral-video-ai-concern-rcna223637\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">like bunnies jumping on a trampoline</a>. But what happens when it's \"politicians\" saying something egregious, or a \"celebrity\" stealing something from a store? One viral Sora video <a href=\"https://x.com/GabrielPeterss4/status/1973120058907041902\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">shows Sam Altman trying to run off with a GPU at Target</a>, before being stopped by a security guard. How many more Sora videos will show Sam Altman, and anyone else who approves of their Cameos being remixed, committing crimes, or simply doing something embarrassing? Those with enough power or fame may be able to debunk the videos, but by then, it'll be too late: Most people who saw it will take it as fact. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabrielPeterss4/status/1973120058907041902\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To that point, it's great that there are security measures in place to stop people from remixing other users' Cameos without permission, but the risk here for abuse is <em>supreme</em>: What happens if someone figures out how to \"scan\" someone's face from a video, or crack the settings that block others from using their original face scan? If they can bypass OpenAI's security measures, they can then remix that person's face into any video approved by the platform.

preferred source for tech news</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>At its fall hardware event today, Amazon announced a new lineup of Kindle Scribe devices, less than a year after the release of the second generation of its writeable e-reader. All three of the devices sport a new design with smaller bezels and a larger 11-inch screen, but the key takeaway is that the same display tech that powers the Kindle Colorsoft is coming to the digital notebook—along with a hefty price tag.</p><h2 id=\"three-new-kindle-scribes-are-on-the-way\">Three new Kindle Scribes are on the way</h2><p>At the event, Amazon revealed plans for an overhauled Scribe lineup that includes three different devices: The standard Kindle Scribe (starting at $499) with front light and the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft (starting at $629) will both be available later this year, while a third version without lighting (starting at $429) will arrive \"early\" in 2026. None of them are available for pre-order just yet.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Given Amazon launched the Kindle Colorsoft e-reader last year, it's unsurprising they are bringing their best-in-class color screen stack to the Scribe—though competitors like Boox have offered color digital notebooks for years. (The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QVEb73?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%24530%20Boox%20Note%20Air%204C&short_url=QVEb73&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Famazon-is-releasing-a-color-kindle-scribe&event_label=%24530%20Boox%20Note%20Air%204C\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">$530 Boox Note Air 4C</a> is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-digital-notebooks-you-can-buy-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">currently my pick for the best all-around digital notebook for most people</a>.) But I find the addition of a Scribe without a front light to be a tad confusing: While it's true that adding a lighting layer puts additional distance between the tip of the stylus and the inner display, which can make the writing experience feel less \"paper-like,\" the 2024 Kindle Scribe (with a great front light) already performs extremely well in that regard. Honestly, I'm surprised Amazon thinks there is a large enough market for a version without lighting, especially given the fact that, at $429, it costs more than the current model <em>with</em> lighting.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-design-and-new-features\">A new design and new features</h2><p>Amazon promises that these Scribes offer an improved experience, whether you opt for color or not: <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-amazon-kindle-scribe-color\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">In a press release</a>, the company touts a new front light system with more uniform lighting, new textured glass that feels better to write on, a new display stack that reduces the distance between the outer glass and inner display, plus a faster processor and more memory. </p><p>The three Scribes all look the same, save for different colored bezels; gone is the offset chunky bezel of the current generation, replaced with thinner, uniform bezels on all four sides of the screen. Without a case, they'll weigh in 400g, 34g lighter than the older model. </p><p>It's hard to say what all that means in terms of practical use—for example, Amazon touts that the new Scribe is \"40% faster for writing and page turns,\" but Kindle page turns are already lightning fast, and as I noted when <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/amazon-kindle-scribe-review\" target=\"_blank\">I reviewed the 2024 Scribe earlier this year</a>, that model already had a great writing experience. The jury is out on whether these updates justify the price increase, whether you're upgrading or buying for the first time. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Hardware aside, Amazon also talked up software changes, including a redesigned home screen that puts your notes front and center, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive integrations, AI-powered search for your notes, and a forthcoming \"Send to Alexa+\" feature that will allow you to converse with the paid version of Amazon's digital assistant about the contents of your notebooks. As yet, it's unclear if previous models will get the new software.</p><h2 id=\"pricier-than-the-competition\">Pricier than the competition</h2><p>Without having gone hands-on with the new Scribes, I can say that all these changes sound great—but those prices, oof. Amazon didn't clarify whether tariffs were a factor, but even given the larger screen (11 inches versus 10.2 inches on the 2024 model), the apparent $100 price jump for the black-and-white Scribe is significant (granted, it's currently unclear how much storage that will get you, but Amazon does note the device \"starts\" at $499, while the 2024 model is priced at $399 for 16GB of storage and goes up from there). And again, the forthcoming model with no front light costs more than the current generation with a light (and a storage boost to 32GB, for that matter).</p><p>With a starting price of $629, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is $100 more than the Boox Note Air 4C, and the latter can do a lot more, given it isn't tied to Amazon's restrictive ecosystem—Boox devices run on an open version of Android with access to the full Google Play store, meaning you can download your preferred reading and productivity apps, rather than restrict yourself to Amazon's OS. The Kindle will likely offer a better writing experience and Amazon's typically frictionless user experience, but when it comes to a pricey tool like this, that's only part of the equation.</p><h2 id=\"get-a-deal-on-a-2024-kindle-scribe\">Get a deal on a 2024 Kindle Scribe</h2><p>If you aren't sold on the promised changes and don't care about color note-taking, it's not a bad time to buy last year's version of the Kindle Scribe: In advance of October Prime Day, it's currently on sale starting at <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4l7l?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%24299%20for%2016GB%20of%20storage&short_url=Qp4l7l&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Famazon-is-releasing-a-color-kindle-scribe&event_label=%24299%20for%2016GB%20of%20storage\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">$299 for 16GB of storage</a>—though I'd probably opt for the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKqXgY?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=limited%20time%20bundle&short_url=QKqXgY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Famazon-is-releasing-a-color-kindle-scribe&event_label=limited%20time%20bundle\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">limited time bundle</a> with a cover and an upgrade to 64GB of storage for $372.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Summer and fall are the perfect time to prepare for standardized aptitude tests. Prepping through summer will help you be ready for a fall exam, giving you enough time to retake for a higher score it in the spring, if needed, or you can prep through fall and target that spring test. Even if you studied all summer, fall is the ideal time to review and cram down to the last minute. And no matter how you tend to learn, an app can probably help. Here are some of the best ones available on iOS and Android (some are available on a browser, too). </p><h2 id=\"try-khan-academy-if-youre-a-long-term-learner\">Try Khan Academy if you’re a long-term learner</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Khan Academy in browsr\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khan Academy</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Khan Academy</a>, a nonprofit organization and partner of the College Board, has become synonymous with test prep. They have free courses in various AP classes, a variety of subjects, and, of course, standardized tests like the SAT and LSAT—which means if you start with Khan while you prepare for the SAT, you can stick with it all the way through wherever your educational journey takes you. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Beyond having a deep selection of study materials, Khan Academy serves up information in video form, with clips that go through practice problems similar to the ones you could face on your exam. For real-deal practice questions, you’ll need to use the desktop version of the site, but the app-based videos are great to take on the go.</p><p>What I like about Khan is that some of the videos and articles are informational. For instance, you can read about calculator policies for the SAT or watch a quick clip that gives you an overview of what the test is and what to expect. Studying material is one thing, but being prepared for the experience is another, and this app is well-rounded there. </p><h2 id=\"use-magooshs-sat-app-for-customized-prep\">Use Magoosh’s SAT app for customized prep</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Magoosh SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_800x453.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_1400x793.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Magoosh</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Magoosh</a> flashcards and practice quizzes go over English and math concepts you should know for your test. Out of all the apps, the Practice & Prep offering is unique because it's dedicated purely to the SAT, but it is customizable. The first time you log in, you're prompted to share when your test is so the app can configure what you should study between now and then. There will be a difference in how you approach it if you have one month or one year to get ready and Magoosh's app knows that.</p><p>Like Khan Academy, this platform gives you information on the test itself, too, offering up a landing page of articles on how to prepare. Beyond that, you get practice questions, videos on the reading and writing sections, and practice tests. While flashcards and study games are useful, practice quizzes are pretty crucial, too, because they give you a better sense of how you'll perform when you're facing down a large volume of content. </p><p>Bear in mind there are <a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">two apps</a> from this company: I like the Practice & Prep, obviously, because it's so customizable and helpful with the quizzes, but there is a separate flashcard app available if you learn better that way and want to double up on the methods you use for studying. </p><h2 id=\"use-varsity-tutors-sat-practice-prep-flashcards-if-you-want-the-most-variety\">Use Varsity Tutors’ SAT: Practice, Prep, Flashcards if you want the most variety</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Varsity Tutors SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_1400x791.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Varsity Tutors</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.varsitytutors.com/sat-mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Varsity Tutors</a> is another well-known name in the studying space, and the company's SAT app is thorough.

The beauty of <a href=\"https://www.brainscape.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Brainscape</a> is that while it's a flashcard app and those are a dime a dozen, it has some legitimacy attached to it because the company works directly with the governing bodies that oversee tests when it creates flashcard decks. AP tests, certification exams, and the SAT are just a few of the options you can study with the knowledge that the questions you're reviewing are actually relevant to the test. Like other apps, Brainscape has an option for reviewing user-generated flashcard decks, too, and that's great—but start with the deck that's been created with the SAT organization itself. </p><p>Crucially, Brainscape uses a version of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">the Leitner method</a> to quiz you. When you finish answering a flashcard, you indicate how well you knew the answer on a scale of one to five. That determines how often that same card is shown to you, with the lesser-known cards cropping up more frequently and the better-mastered cards popping up less often— it forces you to study more effectively, which is a winning strategy. </p><h2 id=\"use-notebooklm-to-shake-things-up\">Use NotebookLM to shake things up</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"NotebookLM in browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Finally, if you're a student or learner of any kind, not just an SAT-prepper, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM AI tool</a>. It's like any other AI chatbot except that it doesn't pull its responses from the Internet. Instead, it relies only on information you feed it. If you have SAT prep tests or study materials from school, a tutor, a guidance counselor, or online, you can upload them into <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">NotebookLM</a> and ask the software to generate a practice quiz, flashcards, summary, or even a \"podcast\" that features two voices discussing the content. No matter how you learn best, NotebookLM has a feature to support you. </p><p>Importantly, it only uses the materials you upload, like I said. This means you won't get any random or incorrect content from the far reaches of the Internet; you'll only get information you select and input. ChatGPT gets things wrong all the time (and I have seen it <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">generate complete nonsense</a> when dealing with people I tutor in writing), so this is a welcome resource if you like using AI but are worried about being misled.

</a>\n        <span>\n            <p>A weekly deep dive into the current trends, slang, and viral videos of youth culture in terms that even the squarest can understand.</p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Are you old enough to remember talking to your friends on the phone all the time? A phone with a <em>cord</em>? Then welcome to the Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture, a guide to what's going down with all the youths out there. This week, the young 'uns are stealing each other's brainrots, guzzling heavy soda, (not) paying $500 for a rock, and being harassed by a rizzed-out robot. </p><h2 id=\"steal-a-brainrot\">\"Steal a Brainrot\"</h2>\n<p>If you know anyone under the age of 16, they are probably playing \"<a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Steal a Brainrot</a>,\" and you are probably asking \"Steal a what now?\" so here's what it's all about: \"Steal a Brainrot\" is a multiplayer mini-game within maxi-games <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. In a game of Brainrot, up to eight players share a server, and each has their own base. The object of the game is to buy brainrots for your base and/or steal brainrots from other players' bases, while defending your own brainrots from thieves. Steal enough brainrots and you become more powerful and can make your base more defensible. The brainrots themselves are objects meant to reference \"Italian brainrot,\" i.e.: low-quality internet memes. They vary in value and have vaguely Italian names, but they aren't based on actual brainrot memes. </p><p>\"Steal a Brainrot\" is insanely popular, boasting a concurrent player count of over 20 million people, so you're probably asking, \"Who is getting rich from this (and why isn't it me?).\" The answer: Two groups are making most of the dough. The first is the game's developers, <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/users/2678001507/profile\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SpyderSammy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dobigstudios.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">DoBig Studios,</a> who get a cut of all the micro-transactions within \"Steal a Brainrot\" (players can spend real money for in-game items). The other beneficiary of all this brainrot is the <a href=\"https://corp.roblox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Roblox Corporation</a>, who provide the platform in exchange for the rest of the money from Brainrot micro-transactions. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As for why it isn't you, it's because you don't have any good ideas.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-heavy-soda\">What is “heavy soda”?</h2><p>Unlike \"heavy water,\" in which H2O's hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms, heavy soda is pop with extra syrup—as hard as this is to believe, some people think Sprite and Mountain Dew just aren't <em>sweet</em> <em>enough</em>. Heavy soda comes from self-serve soda machines. Some, apparently, have a toggle to increase or decrease the amount of syrup in the resulting drinks, and many people on TikTok are great fans of the beverage that results from setting the machine on \"maximum syrup.\"</p><p>Sometimes called \"dirty soda,\" heavy soda supposedly originated in <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@earlypete/video/7494403192969547063\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">gas stations on the Southern tip of Missouri</a>.

More often now, though, it means loading up on new tech. (Although, you can still buy pencils and notebooks <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\"><em>and probably should</em></a>.) Just as you've started getting your class materials through e-book downloads and begun i<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/these-are-the-best-free-study-apps-for-any-learner-1850390146\" target=\"_blank\">ntegrating apps into your studies</a>, you should be leveling up your academic tools, too, to meet modern standards and make your time more productive. There are a ton of great devices out there right now to help you study and manage your scholastic life, but it’s hard to know where to start. Here’s what I recommend.</p><h2 id=\"tools-for-studying-and-working-in-class\">Tools for studying and working in class</h2><p>First up, the tools you should be bringing with you when you're working in class or otherwise on the go. When you need to listen, be engaged, or take notes, you should be able to do so seamlessly. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><strong>A keyboard cover</strong> to stop coffee, crumbs, and dust from gunking up your computer. All it takes is one accident while you’re cramming for a test to throw off your whole week. Make sure to get one that is designed for your exact keyboard. For instance, if you use a MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Ev182?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=try%20this%20one%20for%20%2412.95&short_url=Ev182&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=try%20this%20one%20for%20%2412.95\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">try this one for $12.95</a>. I picked one of these up after I got a new MacBook when I started grad school and even though it took some time to adjust to the feeling of typing on a big piece of rubber, it made cleaning my keyboard so much easier for me. Every time I cleaned it, stains, crumbs, and dust came off—which made me consider that if it hadn't been there, they would have been lodged in my keys.</p></li><li><p><strong>A laptop cooling pad</strong> for when you’re doing heavy work back to back to back. Laptop coolers can help keep your computer from overheating, so you can spend all day doing work without worrying about it getting too hot. <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/PgExP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=This%20Ice%20Coorel%20version&short_url=PgExP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=This%20Ice%20Coorel%20version\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">This Ice Coorel version</a> ($17.98) has six-inch fans and is suitable for laptops between 14 and 16 inches, plus it’s collapsible, so you can take it on the go. Another benefit? It props your computer up slightly so you don't need to hunch over as much, aiding your posture and keeping you more comfortable.</p></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p><strong>An e-reader tablet</strong> to read your textbooks and take quick notes. You can get a refurbished, older version of the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5XGbN?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%207%20for%20about%20%2464&short_url=a5XGbN&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=Amazon%20Fire%207%20for%20about%20%2464\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Amazon Fire 7 for about $64</a>. If you have a preferred notes or organizational app—like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/notion-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">my fav, Notion</a>—opt for an iPad instead, so you can use the app on there. Not sure which version to pick? <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/which-is-better-ipad-9-vs-ipad-10\" target=\"_blank\">Start here</a>. Once you've picked, grab <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ao6pXL?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20stylus%20pen%20for%20%2410&short_url=ao6pXL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=a%20stylus%20pen%20for%20%2410\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a stylus pen for $10</a> so you can scribble notes, make mind maps, draw diagrams, or do whatever else makes you retain your materials better.</p></li><li><p><strong>A portable laptop charger</strong> so your computer never dies in class. The charm of old classrooms at big universities wears off instantly the minute you get to a lecture hall and realize all the seats by the precious few outlets are taken, if there are even an outlets at all. Whether you’re in the library, in class, in the cafeteria, or on the go, a portable laptop charger, like the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/jbN3L?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ZeroKor%20power%20bank%20%28%2453%29&short_url=jbN3L&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=ZeroKor%20power%20bank%20%28%2453%29\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">ZeroKor power bank ($53)</a>, is going to save you a lot of headaches.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"tools-for-studying-and-working-on-your-own\">Tools for studying and working on your own</h2><p>Studying in your dorm or living space is an unavoidable task made maddening by the existence of other people, who can be noisy or have no respect for your stuff. In addition to the following gadgets, I recommend you <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/family/finals-study-methods\" target=\"_blank\">familiarize yourself with some study techniques</a> you can use alongside them.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Sleeping headphones</strong> to block out noise. These comfy wireless headbands are designed to block noise out and funnel the sounds you want—be it music or white noise—directly into your ears. They’re perfect for sleeping or studying, since they are soft and close-fitting, meaning you won’t get a headache and they’re easy to carry around. Try the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/GYENq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Musicozy%20sleep%20headphones&short_url=GYENq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=Musicozy%20sleep%20headphones\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Musicozy sleep headphones</a> ($17), for example. Whenever you're working, but especially when you're studying, you want to be distraction-free and in a state of what's known as \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-deep-work-to-be-more-productive-1850632295\" target=\"_blank\">deep work</a>.\" Blocking out the world around you is a good first step, but you should also consider following the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-pomodoro-method-for-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro technique</a>, which asks you to work uninterrupted in 25-minute increments interspersed with five-minute breaks. Gadgets shouldn't replace old-school mindsets or techniques, but they can enhance them. </p></li><li><p><strong>A</strong> <strong>Pomodoro timer </strong>Speaking of good old Pomodoro, you can pick up <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QmO5X5?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20specialty%20timer&short_url=QmO5X5&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=a%20specialty%20timer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a specialty timer</a> for under $20 that will sit on your desk and keep track of your focus sessions for you. You might think that's a silly gadget to buy, since your phone certainly has a built-in timer feature, but your phone is <em>also </em>full of all the distractions you're trying to avoid when you're engaging in deep work, so it's best to stay away from it if it's too tempting. On the other hand, you can download a Pomodoro app that will not only provide you with a timer, but block all your distracting apps while it's running, which is the best of both worlds. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/focuspomo-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">My favorite is FocusPomo</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A second laptop screen</strong> so you can see and do more. A portable monitor is helpful when you have to look at references to complete work and don’t want to be switching between tabs or minimizing all your windows to see everything at once. They come at different price points, so you don’t have to break the bank: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/xJMoO?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Koorui%20sells%20a%20portable%2015.6-inch%20monitor%20for%20%2480&short_url=xJMoO&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=Koorui%20sells%20a%20portable%2015.6-inch%20monitor%20for%20%2480\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Koorui sells a portable 15.6-inch monitor for $80</a>. I had a setup like this at my old job, where I had <em>three </em>screens that stretched across my desk. I can't tell you how much more productive I was when I didn't have to shift and minimize windows constantly and could just glance at another screen to see the reference materials for what I was working on on the main one. </p></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p><strong>A desk-mounted power strip</strong> so you’re never fighting anyone for an outlet. Your phone, tablet, computer, and countless other pieces of tech all need to be charged, so you should have outlets at your desk to keep them all in one place. The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/wV8bq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Emerising%20power%20strip&short_url=wV8bq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=Emerising%20power%20strip\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Emerising power strip</a> ($30) has four USB ports and three AC outlets to juice it all, right on your desk. Another option that has served me well at home, at school, and at work is the humble multicharger. I've long used the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7MpbP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=STM%20Charge%20Tree&short_url=z7MpbP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=STM%20Charge%20Tree\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">STM Charge Tree</a> ($64), which can charge an Apple Watch, Airpods, and iPhone simultaneously, folds up for easy transportation, and only needs access to one outlet. </p></li><li><p><strong>A lock</strong> to protect your tech so no one else uses it. Ever had a roommate who takes your stuff all the time? Pick up a combination lock that attaches to the smooth surfaces of your tech to keep them where you want them, even when you’re not around. Try the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjAG6?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=CaLeQi%20security%20lock&short_url=9wjAG6&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=CaLeQi%20security%20lock%20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">CaLeQi security lock </a>($10). </p></li><li><p><strong>A lap desk</strong> so you can work wherever you want. A lap desk saves my back from destruction since I just won't give up the habit of working anywhere but an ergonomic desk. The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z6D7bl?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lap%20desk%20I%20prefer&short_url=z6D7bl&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=lap%20desk%20I%20prefer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">lap desk I prefer</a> is just $30 and has a holder for your tablet, USB charging docks, a little drawer for accessories, and a cup holder for your coffee. </p></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p><strong>A monitor clip </strong>so you can see your notes while you work. It’s a small annoyance in the grand scheme of things, but glancing down at your paper notes while you work is tedious, so eliminate the issue with the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/51r4j?pageview_type=Standard&template=Opinions&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kensington%20Flex%20Clip%20copyholder&short_url=51r4j&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-best-study-gadgets-for-students-1850748745&event_label=Kensington%20Flex%20Clip%20copyholder\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Kensington Flex Clip copyholder</a> ($14), which attaches to your laptop monitor and holds your documents at eye level. And if you haven't taken handwritten notes in a long time and can't imagine why this is on the list, let me explain: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">Handwriting your notes </a>actually helps you remember them better. Gadgets, tech, and apps are all crucial to modern-day learning, but mixing in some of the old-style tricks every now and then can be helpful, too.</p></li></ul>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Whether we want to complain, resolve a problem, or simply get information, call center interactions can be a maddening experience. Companies are increasingly hiding their customer service representatives behind phone menus and AI-driven tools, and even if you make contact, the experience is often less than ideal. With <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-october-prime-big-deals-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\">October Prime Day</a> around the corner, finding a solution to this problem can save you a lot of headaches.<br /></p><p>While different companies handle their call centers in different ways (and host them in different countries), there are some universal truths to keep in mind—and use  to your advantage, if you know a few secret ways to navigate them. These tips  won’t guarantee you success in your quest for a refund, a return, or simply an explanation as to why you were shipped you a BTS-branded body pillow instead of the winter coat you ordered. But they will increase your odds of emerging from the call with something to show for your efforts.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><strong>A good general piece of advice:</strong> Keep calm, and always be polite. Call center employees are human beings doing a difficult job, so remind yourself that your beef isn’t with them, it’s with their corporate overlords. </p><h2 id=\"gethuman\">GetHuman</h2><p>Your chances of customer service success increase dramatically when you get a human being on the line. Hitting a rigid phone menu is pretty common these days, and it’s frustrating: The automated options often aren’t flexible enough to cover your specific need, and they seem to be designed to stop all but the hardiest souls from actually reaching a customer service rep (CSR).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2016/08/08/iaw-phone-tree/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>And that’s because they are</em></a><em>.</em> It costs money every time you connect with a CSR, so companies try to keep you away from them as much as possible. So, instead of tangling with their phone menu and hearing “I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that” fifteen times until you set your phone on fire in frustration, try a service like <a href=\"https://gethuman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">GetHuman</a>. Type in the name of the company you’re trying to contact and see if there’s a direct phone number you can dial to get a person, or if they offer a set of easy instructions on how to break out of the phone menu. If you do get a human on the phone, ask for a direct number to call back if your problem needs to be addressed again.</p><h2 id=\"the-supervisor-trick\">The supervisor trick</h2><p>It’s an oldie but a goodie—and it does work. If your CSR isn’t helpful, or you’re not getting the result you want, ask to speak to a supervisor. A slightly more polite and less combative way to do this is to ask to speak to “someone who can solve my problem” or similar language. In almost all situations, your CSR is obligated to transfer you upon request, and supervisors are often empowered to do things the common CSR can’t.</p><h2 id=\"hit-zero-or-say-nothing\">Hit zero—or say nothing</h2><p>If you can’t get any information on how to connect to a  human being, try pressing zero on your phone’s keypad. Many (though not all) call center phone menus will automatically dump you to a CSR if you press zero.</p><p>If that doesn’t work, have a little patience and simply do nothing. Most phone menus will time out if you don’t respond in any way to their prompts—and dump you to a human being by default. This might take a minute or two, but it often works.</p><h2 id=\"call-during-off-hours\">Call during off hours</h2><p>As you might imagine, call centers experience busy times like any other business, and they tend to align with people’s waking hours. If the company you’re trying to reach offers 24-hour customer service, try calling very early in the morning or very late at night. Most sane, well-adjusted people will be asleep or enjoying their lives, so your chances of getting through quickly (and your chances the CSR will have extra time for you) will be better.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"exhaust-the-script\">Exhaust the script</h2><p>It’s important to understand that every single CSR you speak to is working from a script. Companies develop complex algorithms for dealing with customer complaints. These scripts are designed to shorten call lengths—and to avoid outcomes the company finds undesirable (like refunding your money).</p><p>But like all scripts, they’re limited. A few simple tricks can help you break free from the script—and that’s when you can really get something done. A few things to try:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Repeat your demands.</strong> CSR scripts usually have a limit on how often the CSR can refuse you—but they won’t tell you that. Most commonly, if you trigger the same script loop three times, the CSR is obliged to transfer you—or empowered to reveal another option they’ve yet to share. So if the CSR tells you they can’t refund you, don’t just accept it—ask again. And then again. </p></li><li><p><strong>Stay on the line.</strong> CSRs are always on the clock. Every interaction costs the company money, and their job performance is often tied to how quickly they can resolve customer problems. The longer you refuse to end the interaction, the closer you get to being transferred to someone who can actually do what you want, or inspiring the CSR to use some of the power they do have just to get you off the line. </p></li><li><p><strong>Jump the script.</strong> When trying to cancel an account or get a refund, CSR scripts are larded with alternatives, up-sells, and misdirections. (Ever tried to cancel your cable TV and somehow wound up with three months of free HBO instead? That’s the power of the script.) One trick is to start off by pre-refusing everything—tell the CSR you don’t want freebies, discounts, new services, or anything else, you want one <em>very</em> specific thing. This can short-circuit the script and get you where you want to go much faster. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"call-back-immediately\">Call back immediately</h2><p>If your CSR refuses to see things your way, don’t get mad—change venues. Politely end the call, then call back immediately. You’ll almost certainly get a different CSR, and the experience can often be dizzyingly different. That’s because your call may be routed to an entirely different call center, or may be picked up by a CSR with more experience—and more authority.</p><h2 id=\"show-them-the-money\">Show them the money</h2><p>If you’re having trouble getting a human being on the line no matter what you try, there’s one last trick to play: Choose the menu option that involves spending money. Upgrade your account, make a purchase, take on the optional insurance—whatever option results in your bill going up will almost certainly get an eager human being on the phone. They may not be the right person to speak to, but now you’re <em>inside</em> the phone menu, and they can transfer you to a more appropriate department.</p><p>Customer service often seems like a battle of wills. But it’s also a battle of wits, and these secrets will give you some extra ammo.</p><hr /><div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><span>Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Prime Day Deals Right Now</span></p>\n                </div>\n            <p><span>Deals are selected by our commerce team</span>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>One method for faster, more interesting study sessions is popular in elementary schools, which is why you may not have heard of it, though it’s applicable to all ages: the KWL chart. The chart is easy enough for a fourth-grader to construct, but helps make even graduate-level study sessions more fruitful by making them more engaging and easy to follow along with. All you need is a notebook and a pen on hand the next time you're reading, watching, or listening to new material. (For $10, you can even get <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YdXVo?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20notebook%20full%20of%20pre-made%20KWL%20charts&short_url=9YdXVo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fkwl-study-method&event_label=a%20notebook%20full%20of%20pre-made%20KWL%20charts\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a notebook full of pre-made KWL charts</a> so you don't have to do the work of drawing them yourself.)  </p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-kwl-chart\">What is a KWL chart?</h2><p>KWL stands for Know, Want to Know, and Learn. Its use is popular among teachers of younger kids, but it’s recommended by universities, too. KWL charts are part of the constructivist teaching method, which is based on the constructivist theory, or belief that people learn more when they’re actively engaged in the meaningful process of constructing knowledge rather than just passively receiving information. Put more simply, constructivists believe that you learn more when you interact with your material as opposed to just reading or hearing it. <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1304478.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">A smattering of research</a> in the wide world of academia has also suggested that KWL charts are more effective for reading comprehension than conventional, passive techniques.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>To better understand constructivist learning, think of all the other kinds of activities you did in elementary school. Activities like building a model volcano or playing <em>Jeopardy!</em> with big cards taped to the whiteboard are constructivist. You probably even remember some of the content you learned during those games or activities, even though they were years ago and you struggle to remember more boring passages you read just last week. There's a reason for that: Being engaged with a concept truly does make a difference. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-a-kwl-chart\">How to use a KWL chart</h2><p>KWL is similar to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">the SQ3R method</a> in that you’ll be using a pencil and paper to take notes as you study. On your paper, make three columns and title them Know, Want to Know, and Learn. (If you get one of those KWL notebooks I mentioned, this is already done for you.) With or without the pre-made notebook, try to do this by hand, not digitally, as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">handwriting is better for retention</a>. While it's easier to do this in a word processing doc and you might even think you should, so you don't run out of room for all your ideas, the limited space offered by physical paper is a <em>good </em>thing: <em>Also </em>like the SQ3R method, you want to do this on small chunks of material, like a chapter or brief section of text, instead of focusing on too big of an area. </p><p>In the event you've already scaled-down your focus to just one chapter or section but you still think you'll have too much content for three columns on one page, you can opt for three pages, each labeled with one of the KWL pillars, but that should be the maximum space allowance you give yourself. </p><h3>Know</h3><p>Before starting to read a given chapter or section (or watch part of a recorded lecture, listen to an assigned podcast, etc.), write everything you already know—or think you know—about it in the <strong>Know</strong> column. Think of this a little like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">blurting</a>, a learning technique that calls on you to write or say everything you know about a topic before checking it against your notes to see what you missed. In this case, you may not have pre-existing notes to reference, but it will still get you in the zone, at least in terms of using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">active recall</a> to pull anything you might be familiar with out of the recesses of your memory. </p><h3>Want to know</h3><p>Next, move over to your <strong>Want to Know</strong> section and write down what you’d like to learn or get from the material. If you don’t know much about the topic, it’s fine to write that you want to know what it even <em>is</em> or jot down broad questions, but for an easier way to set specific goals, look at things like chapter subheadings, summaries, or tables within your materials, and base your questions off of those. For instance, if your chapter includes a graph showing that a certain disease is more prevalent in a specific country, one of your want-to-know questions can be <em>why</em> that is.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>This is a chance to get creative. Ask unorthodox questions. Take some time to sit and think over what you could endeavor to find out beyond <em>What is this chapter about?</em> The more curious you allow yourself to be, the more you'll engage with the content.</p><h3>Learn</h3><p>Finally, consume the content, whatever it is. As you go through the material, pay close attention for anything that could help you answer the questions you wrote in your want-to-know section. Take notes elsewhere on the page if necessary, because when you’re done, you’ll reflect on what you learned, review the materials and your notes, and mark it down in the <strong>Learn</strong> column. You can write what you learned overall, but be sure that this column also includes the answers to the questions you posed in the second step.</p><h2 id=\"finishing-up-with-kwl\">Finishing up with KWL</h2><p>After all three columns are filled out, you're not quite done. I recommend revising your notes, especially if the chart got messy. Use blurting to see how much of the material stuck with you, then check your blurting against the chart and the source material. Alternately, try a different technique to further entrench the content in your brain. Use your want-to-know questions to create a flashcard deck, for instance, and then follow the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner method</a> of flashcard review. Try using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-feynman-method-to-study\" target=\"_blank\">Feynman method</a> by explaining the chapter content to a friend, a relative, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">even an AI bot</a>, which can help you break down complicated concepts into smaller bites. </p><p>Try this for a variety of uses, even your personal recreational reading. KWL works well for not only the reading comprehension it was designed to enhance, but also taking notes during a lecture, participating in a classroom activity, going to a workshop, or even just watching a documentary. The whole purpose is to keep you focused and curious while you consume information, so you stay engaged as you try to find answers to the original questions you laid out.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

<span>\n            <p><em>In Lifehacker’s series, “A Guide to Automating Your Entire Home,” we’re highlighting all the ways you can power your home with autonomous technology, room by room. Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>If you're starting out with smart home tech, you may feel overwhelmed by all the devices and protocols available to automate every part of your routine. But you don't need to invest a lot of time and money up front to replace all of your electronics. Instead, consider adding wifi-enabled smart plugs around the house to turn your \"dumb\" devices smart. </p><p>Smart plugs, which are available from well-known brands like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPVdwy?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Wyze&short_url=QPVdwy&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fmake-home-smarter-with-smart-plugs&event_label=Wyze\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Wyze</a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aeKnkw?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=TP-Link&short_url=aeKnkw&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fmake-home-smarter-with-smart-plugs&event_label=TP-Link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TP-Link</a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QbMYBJ?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon&short_url=QbMYBJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fmake-home-smarter-with-smart-plugs&event_label=Amazon\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zn5bpD?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GE&short_url=zn5bpD&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fmake-home-smarter-with-smart-plugs&event_label=GE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">GE</a> as well as many others, transform your regular outlets into smart alternatives that can be turned on and off remotely, set on schedules, and even controlled with voice commands. All you have to do is plug them in and connect them to an app, and your lights, small appliances, and other electronics become smart. </p>\n<p>Some of the best smart plugs have useful features like timers, sunrise and sunset scheduling, energy monitoring, and away modes as well as compatibility with smart home platforms from Google, Amazon, and Apple. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"automate-your-daily-routines\">Automate your daily routines </h2><p>With smart plugs, you can put your morning routine on autoplay by setting various devices to activate at specified times. For example, schedule your bedroom lights to switch on to wake you up and have your coffee maker begin brewing simultaneously (don't forget to set it up the night before). You could even use a smart plug in your bathroom to heat up your hair tools before you need to use them.  </p><p>You can set up routines for each individual plug, or you could link them with a voice assistant—using an Alexa-enabled device, for example—to start the whole routine with a single command. The same concept could apply at bedtime, in reverse: Use smart plugs like sleep timers for your lights and your streaming devices or even for preheating an electric blanket or turning on a space heater in your bedroom. </p><h2 id=\"control-indoor-and-outdoor-lights\">Control indoor and outdoor lights</h2><p>Smart plugs can be used to automate your lights even if you don't have smart bulbs. You could set the lamps in your living room to turn off around bedtime and on in the morning—then off again when you leave for work and back on when you return. Or connect your outdoor string lights to a weather-resistant smart plug with a routine to automatically turn on in the evening around sunset and off after an hour or two. Smart plugs are also great for scheduling and automating Christmas lights and indoor grow lights. Aanything you want a timer for, you can do with a smart plug. </p><p><a href=\"https://ifttt.com/explore/smart-plug-roundup\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Using IFTTT capabilities</a>—or as part of a larger smart home ecosystem if you have one—you could link smart plugs with motion sensors to have lights turn on for a set period of time when motion is detected. This could be useful at night in kitchens or common areas after the lights have been turned off as well as in garages and basements. Outdoor lights could be set to activate when a security camera picks up activity. Other uses of IFTTT include having a fan or heater turn on or off when your thermostat hits a specific temperature. </p><p>With smart plugs, there's no need to flip switches or unplug from outlets, making light control much more convenient. As an added bonus, you can save energy (and reduce your power bill) by tweaking routines so lights aren't on when they don't need to be. </p><p>Because smart plugs can be automated and controlled remotely, you can also use them for security when you're away: Set your lights to turn off and on at specified times so it looks like you're home. </p><h2 id=\"command-your-home-appliances\">Command your home appliances</h2><p>If you have devices you want to manage power to, whether you're away from home or simply across the house, connect them to smart plugs—for example, you can put a water kettle or bottle warmer on a schedule, or at least hometurn them on remotely when you need them. Or set up timers for decorative elements like water fountains, aquarium lights, air fresheners, wax melts, and more. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Smart plugs are also useful for ensuring electronics are turned <em>off</em>, like the aforementioned hair tools and space heaters. If you can't remember whether you flipped the switch before you left home, check the power consumption of the smart plugs they're attached to and disable them if needed. </p><p>If you run your washer or dryer through a smart plug, you can get alerts to your phone when they finish their cycles. </p><h2 id=\"access-hard-to-reach-outlets\">Access hard-to-reach outlets</h2><p>With a smart plug, you can control devices connected to outlets in hard-to-reach places—such as high on a wall or behind heavy furniture or in a far corner of your garage—without needing to climb on a ladder or move things out of the way. Plugging the device in initially is the hard part, but after that, you can simply toggle the power on and off via the app or voice command or set up an automation. </p><p>This can also be useful for controlling electronics in areas you don't walk through often, such as water pumps and dehumidifiers in basements and fans in attics and garages. </p><h2 id=\"monitor-energy-usage\">Monitor energy usage</h2><p>Smart plugs provide useful data about the energy draw of various appliances and electronics. When a device is plugged in, you can see its real-time energy usage as well as historical data. Use this to reduce standby or \"vampire\" power, manage battery strain, and identify inefficient, energy-hungry electronics so you can make more informed (and cost-conscious) decisions about your devices. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n            <span>Features editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Apple can keep adding new features and designs with each new smartphone iteration, but if the company just announced a new iPhone with record-breaking battery life, customers would be thrilled. </p><p>While we may have to wait for a time when the iPhone can go a couple days in between charges, Apple has added a new option to iOS 26 in an effort to help extend your iPhone's battery life. The feature, Adaptive Power, uses on-device AI to analyze your iPhone usage and guess the times you'll need additional battery life. This is exactly how I want to see AI being used—not for generating <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-realistic videos</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/spotify-ai-music-policies\" target=\"_blank\">musical slop</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-adaptive-power-tries-to-boost-your-battery\">How Adaptive Power tries to boost your battery</h2><div><p>When Adaptive Power decides it's time to engage, the feature can adjust your iPhone's performance level. This will make some tasks take longer than they normally would, but that slower speed supposedly saves on battery life. In addition, Adaptive Power lowers screen brightness by 3%, limits background activity, and, when your iPhone reaches 20%, kicks on Low Power Mode without asking you first. </p><p>Apple isn't totally clear here about the difference between Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power in general. From what we know, it seems that Adaptive Power simply reduces processing speeds at select intervals, and only slightly lowers brightness, while Low Power Mode slows speeds and display refresh rate, and limits brightness, 5G, iCloud syncing, and mail fetch, among other tasks.  </p></div><p>Adaptive Power is enabled by default on Apple's newest iPhones, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air—the latter of which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">could most likely benefit from such a feature</a>. For all other compatible iPhones, which includes iPhone 15 Pro and newer, the feature is turned off by default. That means, unless you have an iPhone 17 device, you'll need to turn this on yourself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-turn-adaptive-power-on-or-off\">How to turn Adaptive Power on or off</h2><p>Whether you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 17, you'll find the controls for Adaptive Power in the same place. Open Settings, then head to <strong>Battery > Power Mode</strong>. Here, you can tap the toggle next to \"Adaptive Power\" to turn the setting on or off. </p><p>Since Adaptive Power turns on and off throughout the day, Apple also offers you the option to receive alerts whenever the feature is active. You can adjust this setting from the \"Adaptive Power Notifications\" toggle.</p><p>I've been using Adaptive Power since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26 dropped on Sept. 15</a>, but it's tough to say whether the feature has had a noticeable impact on my battery life. I think it would help if Apple added Adaptive Power information to my battery stats, so I could compare the impacts before and after using the feature. For now, I'll continue using it, if for no other reason than to offer my battery the best possible chance of making it through the day without its charger. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

On the surface, it does sound pretty invasive, especially from a company that typically promotes user privacy. While this really is a new feature, here's the thing: It isn't as bad as it sounds. And, if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.</p><p>The feature, \"Visited Places,\" is actually intended to be a private way to keep tabs on the places you've been to, and to easily recall your favorites in the future. When the feature is enabled, Maps will take note of places you visit, even if you don't use Maps to get there. It's like a passive, automatic journal, taking note of restaurants, malls, parks, or simply general locations you venture to day-to-day. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-mange-visited-places-iph0c2597c4f/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According to Apple</a>, all of this information is stored on your synced devices only, and is end-to-end encrypted, which means Apple has no way to access this data. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>If you have the feature enabled, you'll find your Visited Places appropriately tucked away in the \"Places\" menu when you launch Maps. I've only had the feature turned on for a day or so, so I only have three locations currently saved, but all three were destinations I visited without using Maps to guide me there. </p><p>Personally, I have no issue with keeping this setting turned on: Nobody has access to the data except for me, and I can imagine it reminding me of the places I've enjoyed visiting during a future scroll.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says you will be asked to turn on the feature when you open Maps after updating to iOS 26, and, in my experience, that was the case. However, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-iphones-maps-app-is-tracking-you-in-ios-26-heres-how-to-stop-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for CNET writer Zachary McAuliffe</a>, the feature was already enabled without his input. As such, it might be smart to double-check that the feature is set to whichever setting you prefer, lest you allow Maps to track your movements without your knowledge. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-visited-places-in-apple-maps\">How to manage 'Visited Places' in Apple Maps  </h2><p>To check whether the feature is turned on or off, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Maps > Location</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Maps</strong>. Either way, check the toggle next to \"Visited Places.\" </p><p>You can also delete any Visited Places without needing to turn the feature off altogether. Open Maps, tap \"Places,\" then \"Visited Places.\" Here, you can swipe left on any place to delete it, or choose \"Clear History\" to delete them all. Plus, you can choose how long you want Maps to store your Visited Places: The default is \"Forever,\" but you can also select \"3 Months\" or \"1 Year,\" if you wish. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

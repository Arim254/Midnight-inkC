One particularly sneaky scam is a browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack, in which threat actors create a fake browser window that looks like a trusted single sign-on (SSO) login page within a real browser session. Because we use SSO to access many of our online accounts, we may not think twice before entering usernames and passwords on these spoofed pages. Cybercriminals are counting on this to steal user credentials.Rather than redirecting users to a spoofed website, threat actors running a BitB attack create a fake pop-up within the page you're already on (which may either be set up for the attack or compromised in some way). Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they're able to design a login window that looks exactly like the real one, right down to the lock icon and URL in the pop-up's address bar. \nThese fake login windows typically appear in a seamless fashion, such as after a click or redirect you're expecting to lead to SSO. Obviously, entering your credentials hands them directly to the attackers, who can either use or sell them. Fraudulent pop-ups often imitates SSO such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft, though they may exploit any login portal. Earlier this year, researchers at Silent Push identified a BitB phishing campaign targeting Steam users, specifically those playing Counter-Strike 2. Gamers saw a fake browser pop-up window displaying the URL of the real Steam portal, making them more likely to enter their credentials without suspicion. The attackers also featured the likenesses of eSports team NAVI to lend credibility. Signs of a BitB scamBecause threat actors are able to so closely imitate trusted sign-on pages, including using the real domain in the address bar, a visual inspection may not be enough to catch the fraud. Instead, you need to interact with the window in some way. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn many cases, a genuine SSO pop-up can be dragged around and away from the browser page it appears on top of, so you can first try to move it elsewhere on your screen. However, some SSO dialogs are static, so if you can't drag it, try to highlight the URL or click the padlock icon to show certificate details. If these elements are fake, you won't be able to interact with them at all because the window itself is just an image. This is also an excellent reason to use a secure password manager to fill your credentials instead of entering them manually. A password manager will work only on the legitimate domain. If it doesn't autofill, don't automatically override it—check to ensure the pop-up is real. You should also have a strong form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled wherever possible, so even if your username and password are somehow compromised, attackers won't have the additional factor needed to actually access your account. Note that hackers can still phish some forms of authentication—physical keys along with biometrics and passkeys are the most secure options. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices. The campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms. How attackers are using ChatGPT Kaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas. \nHowever, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.A further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\" \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem. Don't trust every command AI generatesIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past. Of course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The latest macOS update (26.2) has a trick for this: you can use the edge of your screen as a ring light.The feature, which adds a rounded white rectangle to your screen, is called Edge Light. The rectangle takes up part of your screen but will become partially transparent if you move your mouse pointer into it, meaning you'll mostly be able to use your computer normally.You can use the feature by clicking the camera icon on the menu bar during a call and toggling on the Edge Light option. You can also adjust the brightness and the color of the edge light from here.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this in a well-lit room and didn't notice much of a difference, which makes sense. In a totally dark room, though, it proved extremely helpful. Here's how I looked without Edge Light:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAs you can see, I'm just barely lit by the laptop itself.

For reasons I don't understand, kids love it when something is being timed. But that only work a few times at the most, so it's good to have as many other tricks on hand as possible. That's why I was fascinated to learn there are multiple websites that use the microphone on your laptop to motivate kids to be quiet. Some put children's curiosity to work, having animated characters show up if the group is quiet for long enough. Others combine animation with good old-fashioned timers.Here are a few you can check out—all of them are completely free and don't require anything more than your browser.\nSilent Forest: Animals emerge if the room is quiet\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nSilent Forest shows a simple animated forest with a volume indicator. Stay silent for a bit and a cat shows up. A bit longer and a bear shows up. Who else might join? There's only one way to find out. Make too much noise, though, and you'll scare the animals, meaning you have to start over if you ever want to see everyone. The idea is that the kids will be curious to see which animals will show up next and keep quiet—and, ideally, pressure each other into staying quiet.Bouncy Balls: Noise will disrupt the balls\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nBouncy Balls fills your screen with balls—options include colored balls, emojis, numbered balls, eyeballs, and even bubbles. The balls are constantly vibrating, threatening to explode with a bit of noise—which they do. There's a risk of this backfiring—it's sincerely very fun to see the balls bounce—which you can mitigate by enabling a shushing or beeping sound after any violation.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nClassroom Zen: Don't interrupt Ruby or Milo\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nClassroom Zen offers a few different tools for keeping the room quiet. Two feature Ruby, a cartoon who is meditating in either the mountains or the desert. If the room gets too loud, her eyes will start opening—keep going and she'll ask the room to be quiet.

Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act. To activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\" This is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's not really true, though maybe the \"Phone\" app does get underused. Instead, many of us have turned to chat apps for our calls. FaceTime, WhatsApp, Messenger—these apps are now our go-to choices for getting in immediate touch with friends and family. (Not that I'm complaining: The call quality is usually better, anyway.) But one thing the Phone app—and traditional phone calls—have on these chat apps is voicemail. For decades, when you called someone and they didn't answer, you could \"leave a message after the tone.\" That way, when the person saw they had a missed call, they didn't need to guess what you wanted to say. If it was important, they'd hear about it, and call you back. If it wasn't, they could choose to call back when it was convenient. Voicemail isn't dead: You can still leave these messages if you call someone the old fashioned way. But since many of us choose to use our chat apps of choice, we've largely lost this practice. It's been wholly replaced with text messages and voice notes: If they don't answer the call, you can simply text them what you wanted to talk about, or record a voice note to achieve a similar end.    \nSome chat apps are trying to bring voicemails back, however. The first major player on my radar was FaceTime: Back in 2023, Apple made it possible to leave video and audio messages for people whenever they didn't pick up a FaceTime call. It's a small but logical feature: Sure, there are other ways to leave a message. But it just makes sense given the history of phone calls to present the option as soon as someone misses your call. How WhatsApp voicemails workNow, WhatsApp is getting in on the feature. The company first started testing missed call messages in August, before rolling out the option in full on Thursday. Now, when you try calling someone in WhatsApp and they miss it, you have the option to leave either a video or an audio message—depending on what type of call you started.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAgain, these are functions you could initiate already in the app itself: You could simply record a video saying what you want to say, and send it to the recipient, or record an audio note letting them know to call you back. But this built-in option isn't only convenient, it establishes voice messages as a standard for missed WhatsApp calls.  Interestingly, WhatsApp says this new feature \"will make voicemails a thing of the past.\" As it see it, it's actually keeping them alive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

You now have a Workout Buddy to help you exercise—though it'll only work if you have the right iPhone—and there's now a helpful gesture to dismiss your notifications. Apple is back at it today with updates across its Apple products, including the Apple Watch: watchOS 26.2 is a minor update, even compared to watchOS 26 proper, but there are still some key things to highlight here. In fact, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  watchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. \nGoing forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMusic app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.Enhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In fact, roughly half of FSA holders in recent years have ended up forfeiting funds to their employers, according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).First, make sure to double-check with your employer about your FSA's Dec. 31 deadline, along with any potential rollover or grace period. After that, it's time to scan your medicine cabinet, make a list of anything you need to stock up on, and click \"add to cart.\" The FSA store is an obvious choice for making the most of your remaining funds, but you can also turn to your go-to retail giants. Amazon, Target, Walgreens, and more all offer a dedicated FSA/HSA Shop to help you find eligible items quickly.\nHow to shop FSA-eligible items on AmazonHere's how you can take advantage of Amazon's FSA-eligible items before the end of the year.1. Visit Amazon's FSA Store at amazon.com/fsa2. Look for the \"FSA/HSA Eligible\" label on product listings3. Use the FSA/HSA filter in search results4. Pay with your FSA debit card at checkout\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSimilarly, Target has an FSA filter in their healthcare section, and pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens have dedicated online FSA shops.What to buy with your remaining FSA fundsMany over-the-counter medications and health items are FSA-eligible, including pain relievers, cold medicine, bandages, dental care products, menstrual products, and more. But did you realize you can also snag these kinds of goodies:First aid suppliesContact lenses and solutionsReading glassesFancy sunscreenBlood pressure monitorsEpsom saltMassage gunsPimple patchesAn Oura ringA WHOOP bandA $229.99 water dental flosserAgain, most FSA plans require you to spend funds by Dec. 31, though some offer grace periods. Check with your plan administrator for specific deadlines. Just make sure to save receipts for all FSA purchases in case you need to verify eligibility with your plan administrator after paying.However you choose to spend your FSA funds, don’t let that money go to waste. After all, this money already came out of your paycheck.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Android users can now share a live stream of their surroundings with 911, allowing emergency services to assess and provide guidance in real time while you wait for help to arrive onsite.Emergency services on AndroidYour Android already shares some information with first responders via Emergency Location Services (unless you disable this feature). This built-in tool sends an accurate location as well as contextual information, such as language settings, when you call or text an emergency number. Now, that includes live video from your device's camera. You don't need to do anything to set up Emergency Live Video. Once available in your area, responders can send a request during an emergency call or text to securely share your camera's live video. You'll see a prompt on your screen to start sharing with one tap. \nAccording to Google, Emergency Live Video is encrypted by default. Users can choose whether to share their video from the prompt as well as stop the share at any time by clicking the onscreen Stop sharing button. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLive video sharing is rolling out now to U.S. users, as well as those in parts of Germany and Mexico, on Android phones running Android 8 and up. Google says they are partnering with public safety organizations to expand the feature to more users. Other Android safety featuresEmergency Live Video is the latest in Google's suite of safety features designed to make help more accessible—more quickly—in an emergency. Pixel users in Australia, North America, and several dozen countries across Europe now have access to Satellite SOS, which allows you to call emergency services even without a cellular or wifi connection. Car Crash Detection contacts emergency services and shares your location in the event of severe crash, while Fall Detection and Loss of Pulse Detection will call for help based on Pixel Watch sensor data. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.  Google's virtual try on feature only needs a selfie to workWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.I'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.  \nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to upload a selfie to Google's virtual try on featureIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed. Again, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.If AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good. Then, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes. \niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)How to AirDrop with strangers using AirDrop codesHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction. As stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

At one point, many major Android devices came with dedicated LEDs that would shine whenever you received a notification. It was a passive way to know whether you had something on your phone to attend to, without having to actually wake up the display and risk getting unnecessarily sucked into your device. iPhones have never had this specific feature, but Apple included a workaround for anyone interested in a similar experience. For years, you've been able to dive into Accessibility settings to turn your iPhone's LED flash into a notification light. Any time you received a text, app notification, or call, your camera flash would go off, ensuring you didn't miss an important update. This can be helpful both those who are hard of hearing, and who wouldn't be able to rely on audible alerts, or anyone who keeps their phone on silent, but would like a visual cue that they have a new notification. For the first time in years, Apple is updating its flash alerts feature. With iOS 26.2, which the company released on Friday, you now have the option to have your iPhone's display itself flash for new alerts. You can choose to make the display the only light that flashes, or to use the feature in tandem with the LED flash, which I think makes the most sense for people who like this option. That way, it won't matter whether your iPhone is face up or face down: You'll always see a light flash for new alerts one way or another. \nDisplay flash doesn't work like you might expect, especially if you've used LED flashes before. I thought my iPhone would flash a bright light on and off again a few times, mimicking how LED flash alerts works. Instead, when you get a new notification, the screen instantly increases the brightness for a few seconds, before lowering it again. It works—you're bound to notice your display jump in brightness if it isn't already maxed out—but it doesn't quite grab your attention as well as the LED flash. How to set up Flash for Alerts on iPhoneTo start, open the Settings app on your iPhone, then head to Accessibility. Scroll down to Hearing, then choose Audio & Visual. Scroll to the bottom of this page, then tap Flash for Alerts.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're running an older version of iOS, you'll only have the option to enable \"LED Flash.\" However, those running iOS 26.2 and newer will also see an option for \"Screen.\" Choose that option if you want the display to flash for new alerts, or \"Both\" to have both lights enabled. You'll also find two choices that affect when these flash alerts go off, no matter which of the above options you pick. First, you can choose whether your iPhone will use flash alerts while locked. If you disable this option, you'll only see these light alerts when your iPhone is unlocked. Second, you can choose whether to use flash alerts in Silent Mode. I'd keep that setting enabled, since it seems most useful when your iPhone has no other way to alert you to new notifications. It's also important to note that using an Apple Watch can complicate this feature a bit, at least in my experience. While giving this option a test, I had trouble getting alerts to come through on my locked phone without first going to my watch. If you have an Apple Watch, and its notifications mirror your iPhone's, you'll get the most out of this feature when your iPhone is unlocked. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.At least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.The free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.\nI tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There are a lot of different kinds of cars, from old classics being maintained with love, to snazzy new electric rides, or luxury cruisers filled with cutting-edge tech. Whichever kind you drive, getting the most out of your vehicle demands regular maintenance and sensible driving practices, but you can also goose just a bit more out of any vehicle with these universal car hacks.Throw some anti-seize lubricant in your trunkIf you’ve been driving for a while, you know that flat tires only come at the worst possible times. Sunny days when you have plenty of time? Those tires are infallible. Whiteout conditions and you’re racing to a job interview? Guaranteed flat—and you will discover that your lug nuts have fused and become absolutely impossible to shift.One way to prevent this is the judicious use of a little anti-seize lubricant, which is designed to prevent rust and other corrosion. Mechanics argue about this, to be fair—some professionals believe that using anti-seize on lug nuts changes the required torque, which can loosen them over time. But plenty of folks have used a small amount of anti-seize lubricant to make changing or rotating tires a lot easier without any adverse effects. The key is to use a very small amount—just enough to protect the threads.\nAdd silicone lubricant to your door gasketsThe seals around your car’s doors help to insulate the interior. Over time, these seals can become stiff and begin to fall apart, which makes your vehicle unattractive and less comfortable to ride in. You can prevent this with a simple hack: Grab some silicon lubricant and apply thin layer onto the rubber gaskets around your doors, trunk, and windows. It’ll save you a bit of frustrating maintenance in the future—and can prevent doors from freezing closed in winter. (An oft-repeated version of this hack is to use petroleum jelly, which is OK in a pinch, but it can cause rubber to degrade over time, which silicone lubricants won't.)Track your tire tread wear with a quarterTire tread is essential for the safe and efficient operation of your car. Bald tires not only make it more likely you’ll hydroplane or otherwise lose control of the vehicle, they also make your car burn more fuel to overcome their rolling resistance, lowering your vehicle’s fuel efficiency.Tire tread is measured in 32nds of an inch—new tires typically have a tread depth of 10/32” or 11/32”, and you should replace your tires when the tread is eroded to about 4/32” or less. You can track this easily with a quarter—find the most worn-down spot on your tire, slide an upside-down quarter into the tread. If you can see the top of Washington’s head, you should replace the tire. You can also use a penny to see if you can still see the top of Lincoln’s head, but this measures 2/32” of tire tread, which means you should replace the tire immediately. The quarter test warns you to replace your tire before it’s a dangerous situation.Prevent small window cracks from spreading with nail polishA cracked windshield is ugly, and even a tiny crack will probably spread, slowly but inexorably, until you have no choice but to replace the glass entirely. If you have a noticeable crack in your windshield, you should replace it—but if that’s not possible right away, there’s a short-term hack you can use: Nail polish.This isn’t a permanent repair, but it will buy you some time by slowing down the crack’s spread. Clean the damaged area thoroughly, then coat the exterior and interior of the cracked area with clear nail polish. Let it dry, and go about your business. You'll still eventually need to replace the windshield (or have a more permanent repair job done to it), but this hack will let you plan for the work instead of having to deal with it as an emergency.Stop stuff from falling between the seats with pipe insulationHave you ever lost your keys, phone, or anything else between the seats in your car? If so, you know it’s like Mission: Impossible to reclaim your property. Those spaces were just not designed for human beings to get into.An easy hack to prevent the situation from happening in the first place is to close off those gaps (this also prevents crumbs and other dirt from filling those spaces). Pipe insulation is the perfect material for this: Cut a piece to length and jam it between the seats (or the seats and the console), and never lose anything ever again. In a pinch, the ever-useful pool noodle could be used as well. Alternatively, you can buy storage organizers designed to fit in those gaps, which solve the problem while giving you some extra space for stuff.Use a plunger to fix minor dentsA dent in your car is annoying—and potentially expensive to fix. For minor cosmetic dents, you don’t need any special tools or professional help. All you need is a heat source and a common bathroom plunger.For the heat source, you can boil some water, pour it over the dent, then use the plunger to pull the dent out. You can also use a heat gun or a hair dryer, though the water might help the plunger get a nice seal on the car body.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPut socks on your wiper bladesNothing’s more fun than fighting your way through frigid cold to your car, only to discover that the wiper blades have frozen to your windshield. Sure, your car will eventually heat up enough to free the wipers, but if you’d prefer not to have to wait for that miracle to happen, keep an old pair of tube socks in the glove compartment. On cold nights when frozen wipers are a good probability, cover your wiper blades with the socks. This will protect them from damage as well as prevent them from freezing onto your windshield.Try to always turn right to save money on gasThis is one of those amazing tricks that people have difficulty believing, but it actually works: To save money on gas, always make right turns unless a left turn is absolutely necessary—yes, even if that makes your trip longer.UPS put this policy into its vehicle routing software, instructing their drivers to avoid left turns as much as algorithmically possible, and it claims to use about 10 million fewer gallons of gas every year as a result. In fact, our greatest repository of scientific knowledge, Mythbusters, once did a segment proving that they used about 3% less fuel by avoiding as many left turns as possible while driving a fake delivery truck.Note, this doesn’t mean never making a left turn. It means prioritizing right turns when planning your route, even if it makes your trip longer. Whether the extra time involved is worth saving a little gas money is a whole other decision.Use hand sanitizer on frozen locksAnother annoyance on cold winter mornings? Frozen car locks and doors. While most newer cars have keyless entry these days, you can still find yourself dealing with a frozen door, and if your battery has died due to the cold, you might need to use a physical key to gain entry to the car. When that happens, a simple hack is to whip out the hand sanitizer you probably have in your coat pocket. Squirt some into the lock (or coat your physical key before you insert it) or around the edge of the door. After a few seconds, the alcohol in the sanitizer will have melted the ice and you’ll be able to easily open everything up.Get a glovebox organizer to maximize your storage spaceNo one has used a car’s glovebox to store gloves in a long time. What most of us do is jam things in there on the theory that we might need them someday, then forget what’s in there and go a decade or two without actually opening it.Instead, hack that space with an organizer. You can find some molded plastic organizers designed to fit specific models (like this one for a Toyota Tacoma, or this one for Tesla Model 3s), or you can find wallet-style organizers that will keep your documentation and other items neatly stored, making the glove box actually useful for a change.\n            \n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

The messages originate from a legitimate PayPal address, allowing them to evade some security filters and leave recipients worried that their accounts have been compromised—perhaps just enough to ignore the obvious red flags and call or email scammers back. I personally have been targeted by this scam with at least five separate emails, though all have gone straight to my spam folder. Here's how scammers are exploiting PayPal settings to land in your inbox. How the PayPal scam worksIf you're targeted by this campaign, you may receive an email with the subject line \"Your automatic payment status has changed\" or \"Recurring Payment Reactivated.\" The layout imitates a real PayPal notification and includes a message about a high-dollar payment being \"successfully processed\" along with a customer service email and phone number to contact PayPal support. \nThe email is full of red flags: It is addressed to a random name (or, in one of the messages I received, \"Hello Update Invoice\"), has poor spelling and wonky formatting, and simply doesn't make sense. You can easily spot oddities like bold text and Unicode characters, which BleepingComputer notes is a trick used to bypass spam filters and keyword detection. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nWhere the trick lies is in the sender field, as the email comes from service[at]paypal[dot]com, a legitimate PayPal address, and paypal.com is in the signed-by field. As Malwarebytes Labs describes, this is likely an abuse of PayPal's subscription billing feature. If a merchant pauses a customer subscription, the user will receive an automatic email from PayPal notifying them that their payment is no longer active. Scammers are likely setting up fake subscriber accounts using Google Workspace mailing lists, so automatic emails being generated are sent to everyone on those lists. If you look at the \"To:\" field, you'll see that the message isn't actually addressed to your email. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nExploiting these types of loopholes to make phishing emails seem legit is a common tactic, and I've covered several similar PayPal phishing campaigns already this year. According to a statement provided to BleepingComputer, PayPal is working on mitigating this specific flaw. Ignore PayPal payment notificationsIf one of these PayPal messages lands in your inbox, don't engage with it. Scammers frequently use emails, texts, and calls about account security and financial transactions to scare you into action, and the impersonation of trusted institutions is often pretty convincing. If you are concerned about activity on your PayPal account, go directly to the app or website and log in to view alerts and check transactions. Do not use contact information or click any links in the original notification, as this increases the chances of compromising your information or downloading malware to your device. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

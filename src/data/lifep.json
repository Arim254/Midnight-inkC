Apple's distinct new design language has been met with praise and criticism, with some users enjoying the refreshed look, and others bemoaning the UI's issues with visibility and consistency.  It seems Apple was similarly of two minds on the update, having toyed around with the exact look of Liquid Glass throughout the iOS 26 beta testing period. The company seemed to be having trouble settling on a specific balance between the design's glassy effect, which can look really cool, and its overall readability. If buttons are too clear, for example, they'll let in more of the background elements, which can make it more difficult to see them. But by reducing the glass effect too much by adding a tint to the icon and menu backgrounds, Apple risks loses the charm of the design entirely. (Some critics have dubbed it \"Frosted Glass\" by comparison.)While Apple is seemingly still continuing to tweak Liquid Glass, it appears the company has decided that part of the problem is down to user preference. So rather than stick with one look for the design, Apple now lets you choose whether Liquid Glass looks more clear, or more tinted.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo be clear, or not to be clearThis new setting came as a bit of a surprise. Apple did not roll it out until the fourth beta for iOS 26.1 and macOS 26.1, only two weeks before the updates' official release. The toggle, which you can find in Settings > Display and Brightness (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings > Appearance on the Mac (macOS), gives users a simple choice in how Liquid Glass looks across their particular system: \"Clear,\" which is more transparent, and is in-line with Liquid Glass' original intent; or \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of menus and windows. You'll likely be able to read these elements better, but you won't see as much of the background shining through. \n    \n            \n            \"Clear\" (left) vs. \"Tinted\" (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGiving users what they asked for (sort of)During the pre-release beta testing period, some users called on Apple to add a Liquid Glass \"slider\" to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The idea was to allow users to fine-tune how Liquid Glass looks. Apple seems to have taken a different approach, offering only two levels of transparency with the new control. While a slider (or more transparency options, at least) would be great, what we're getting is better than nothing for users who prefer a more opaque Liquid Glass appearance.Before Apple added this dedicated settings page, there was a workaround you can use to \"undo\" Liquid Glass: By kicking on the \"Reduce Transparency\" feature in Accessibility settings, you could achieve a similar look to choosing the new \"Tinted\" option. I think you'll find that \"Tinted\" will achieve a more visually pleasing look, however, as it is something Apple deliberately implemented to work with the design of Liquid Glass, while reduce Transparency is simply a blanket effect that turns down transparency effects across iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nResearchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It was a clever way of ensuring than your iPhone didn't unlock in your pocket, or due to an accidental touch. With iOS 10, Apple killed slide to unlock in favor of pressing the Home button, then later swiping up on the bottom of the screen. Since then, for the better part of a decade, swiping right on the Lock Screen simply takes you to the \"Today View,\" which contains your widgets. Change is good, and I don't necessarily think Apple should bring back slide to unlock for the Lock Screen, but sometimes, I miss how things worked on my old iPhone 3GS. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. To my absolute surprise, however, the company is bringing back the slide function—just not to unlock. Instead, you're now able to slide to stop your alarms, which might come as a surprise to anyone used to the usual alarm routine. Imagine it: One morning, you're tapping to turn off your alarm as usual; the next, your taps are fruitless, and your alarm keeps blaring. Bleary-eyed, you look at your screen, to find a new \"Slide to stop\" function. If you're like me, you'll follow instructions, sliding to stop the alarm, only to forget the whole ordeal within moments, doomed to repeat the affair the next morning. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis change arrives as part of iOS 26.1, which dropped on Monday, and Apple doesn't give you any say in the matter—at least, not at first. After updating to the latest update, your next alarm or timer will include the next slider (though \"snooze\" or \"repeat\" remain buttons), but the switch up is fine by me. I like it, and it brings back a fun feature from iOS' heyday. But if you dislike the change, and you wish you could simply tap a button to silence your alarms and timers, the good news is, you still can. How to disable \"slide to stop alarm\"Apple buried the option to revert your alarm and timers back to the way they used to be, so I wouldn't blame you for not knowing they even exist. You won't find them in the Clock app's settings page, which is confusing. Instead, it's part of a hidden system-wide setting, called \"Prefer Single-Touch Actions.\"  This setting will disable sliders across iOS, and replace them with buttons. For our purposes, that turns \"Slide to stop\" back into a simple off button. To find it, head to Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then enable the toggle next to \"Prefer Single-Touch Action.\" \n    \n            \n            Slide to stop (left) vs. stop button (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Technically, this also makes it clearer that the rule applies to everyone and not just those using the OpenAI API to build an app, but average users are unlikely to see a change.The important words here are \"provision\" and \"providing.\" The terms, as written, don't necessarily ban the average person from getting legal and health advice from ChatGPT, but instead discourages developers and hospitals or law offices from using the chatbot to give specific advice to a client without first checking in with a licensed professional. As an average person doing background research, you're unlikely to bump up against it, and there's no language indicating a change to the chatbot's functionality. In short, the update is intended as a rewording, not a change to rules, enforcement, or functionality.This is backed up by OpenAI's statement, which comes from the company's head of health AI Karan Singhal, and says \"ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDespite this, responses to OpenAI's statement denying a change to model behavior still claim to have seen more difficulty looking certain topics up, although it's important to note that OpenAI's release notes don't indicate any new model developments having been made since the update to the company's usage policies.On an anecdotal note, I was able to get ChatGPT to offer me advice on how to fight a traffic ticket in court, as well as suggest brands for a supplement a user said the model refused to provide specific advice about following the new policy update.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nWhile I cannot test every possible use case, the situation seems clear to me. Are you using ChatGPT or the OpenAI API to give others specifically tailored legal or health advice, without review by a licensed professional? If so, the same rules apply as before. If not, you're unlikely to see a change in your results.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There's WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Signal, Telegram, and iMessage (if you're on iPhone), and that's just the dedicated chat apps. You might have to keep up with new messages on Instagram, TikTok, Threads, even Spotify. If I install one more app with a messaging feature, I'm going off the grid. As it happens, another non-chat app is joining this list. On Tuesday, Zillow—yes, Zillow—announced its app will also now support messaging. Starting today, you can send people messages in the app you use to look at houses you will most likely never actually buy. We live in interesting times, indeed. Of course, Zillow's goal here isn't to become the next WhatsApp. In fact, you can only choose to chat with one other person on Zillow—at least, that's the case for now. The idea of Zillow messaging is strictly to chat about listings you find through the app, without needing to leave Zillow to do so. The goal for most app developers is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, so there's a cynical case to make here for Zillow trapping its users within the app. If you don't move to another chat app to talk about a listing, you're more likely to interact with additional houses on the app. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut I actually see the logic here: If you're in a housing market with a lot of listings, you're probably firing off a number of them every day to interested parties—namely, whoever you're buying the house with. Keeping those conversations in the same app as those listings could be a smart way to keep track of all those houses, instead of the usual routine of \"wait, which house was that? I can't find the text you sent me.\" And the fact that Zillow is limiting this experience to one chat partner at this time means you're not going to be DMing a number of people about houses in your area. This does seem designed for people who are trying to buy a house together to do so with a bit more convenience.How to try Zillow messagingThis feature is live as of this article. To get started, open Zillow on your smartphone or in your web browser. On the app, tap \"Inbox;\" on the web, click your profile in the top-right, then choose \"Inbox.\"  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to start a chat, you need to invite the other person to join you. To do so, choose \"Invite now,\" which will pull up a pop-up about the feature. This screen explains the invite link is good for 24 hours, and that you can only invite one person for now. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nChoose \"Share invitation,\" and Zillow will let you share it wherever you'd like. You can copy the link, and paste it in another chat app, or choose a destination for Zillow to share the link to directly.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That means when it comes to tasks that don't quite require that level of involvement, your productivity method can actually manage to stress you out. If you're tired of your to-do list feeling like such a heavy lift, you can  make simplifying things, well, simpler by prioritizing your tasks with the \"must, should, want\" technique. What is the “must, should, want” technique  This technique was developed by Jay Shirley about a decade ago. The blogger set out to enhance not only people’s productivity, but their daily enjoyability, too, This is important, as if you're miserable and unmotivated, you're not going to be especially productive. With this system, instead of prioritizing tasks only based on productivity or results, you also incorporate some of what you want to do, which helps round out your day without grinding you down.Similar to systems like Agile Results, “must, should, want” requires you to spend a little time every morning planning out your day. Setting aside a few dedicated minutes to figuring out the day’s plan is a good way to get in the zone and stay on track, but you have to remember to write down your goals to stay motivated and organized. In your planner (or in an app like Notion, if you want), create three columns: must, should, and want. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nUnder “Must,” write down what you must do on a given day, whether it’s a smaller piece of a larger, long-term project or an item that is due in a few hours. (If you need help figuring out those pieces and when they need to be done on time to best serve your larger goals, try incorporating the kanban method.) “Should” tasks are those you ought to do for the future, but aren’t down to the wire on yet—or those that won’t be earth-shattering if you don’t get them done right away. Finally, “want” tasks are those that you’d simply like to do, whether they have to do with your immediate responsibilities or not. \"Want\" is where this method differs from all others—plenty of methods out there ask you to prioritize your to-dos by level of \"must\" or \"should\" level urgency, but only this one leaves room for enjoyment.You complete each list in order. Getting through the things you must and should do leaves room for the things you want to do, and that pending reward can motivate you through the more rigid stuff.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen and how to use the “must, should, want” methodThis works well for an overall day plan, incorporating work and responsibilities with after-hours hobbies. But it’s also helpful for specific projects, as it changes every morning. Today’s “should” tasks might be tomorrow’s “must” tasks, so there’s room for variability and a more fluid approach, as long as you stick with the habit of redoing your lists every morning. Getting a \"should\" done early can be motivating, but even identifying what is a \"must\" and what is a \"should\" can alleviate some of your stress and keep you engaged.It’s also helpful for budgeting. Before you get paid or go shopping, make a list of what you must buy, what you should buy, and what you want to buy. Even seeing it written out like that will help you make better purchasing decisions.To keep it all doable and manageable, challenge yourself to only put three to four things in every list on a given day. You’ll never get to the “want” column if you have nine “must” activities and seven “should” tasks, which defeats the point of the technique. Be discerning and if something isn’t a “must,” don’t pressure yourself; just make it a “should.” This approach is designed to inject some fun and reduce the stress from your typical to-do list, but it won’t work if you treat every task like an end-of-the-world necessity. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

It all started last week, when Disney pulled its channels from YouTube TV, Google's Live TV service, over fee disputes. Now, Disney seems to be pulling content from other Google services as well. As first noted by 9to5Google, Disney movies are starting to disappear from YouTube's pay-per-view offerings too, and even other platforms like Google TV.For instance, try typing \"Avengers\" into your YouTube search bar right now. Aside from trailers and videos uploaded from individual users, you're more likely to see a rental option pop up for that 1998 Sean Connery and Uma Thurman spy movie than Marvel's superheroes. Meanwhile, Superman, a Warner Bros. movie, has a large \"Buy or rent\" button right at the top of the page.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe same goes for Lilo & Stitch. Currently, YouTube shows no option to buy or rent either the original Lilo & Stitch or its remake, but pay-per-view buttons for Dreamworks family movie The Bad Guys 2 show up front and center at the top of the page, just like with Superman. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nEven movies from Disney subsidiaries seem to be affected. While I was able to navigate to a rental page for Alien, which is now owned by Disney after its acquisition of Fox, I couldn't actually go through with purchasing the movie. Instead, I just saw a message saying, \"This video contains content from Fox. It is not available.\"\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI ran into the same issues trying to find these movies on other Google services, like Google TV (which also offers rentals, much like Apple TV) or the Play Store, but notably, all of the movies listed above are available on non-Google platforms, like Prime Video. Even older \"Disney Vault\" titles, like the original The Little Mermaid, are on Prime, but are nowhere to be seen on Google's services.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI've reached out to both Disney and Google for comment, and will update when I hear back. In the meantime, neither company has made an official statement about this seeming pay-per-view content blockade.My two cents? It's a negotiation tactic. YouTube's pay-per-view offerings are a separate service entirely from YouTube TV, and are thus likely unaffected by that platform's licensing deals. At the same time, in pulling more of its content from Google's other platforms, Disney can exert additional leverage on Google to pay up to stream its channels.It's not the only mind game going on right now, for what it's worth. At time of writing, it's currently the first major election day in the U.S. since last year's presidential election, and yesterday, Disney offered to temporarily return ABC to YouTube TV so viewers could keep up with the news. YouTube rejected the proposal, saying it would \"cause customer confusion\" and instead proposed that Disney \"immediately restore\" ABC and ESPN while negotiations continue, as a sign of good faith.\"Those are the channels that people want,\" YouTube said, implying that it is being overcharged for additional channels that viewers show little interest in. The company then said that if Disney is willing to play ball, it can \"get these channels live in hours.\"That's certainly more heated than we've seen past YouTube TV negotiations, which were largely settled before customers saw any impact, get. While it's possible Disney might actually take YouTube up on its offer, we're probably not out of the woods yet. Luckily for YouTube TV subscribers, YouTube is promising remediation if the situation drags on any further, and some have even started to see it. As someone who doesn't subscribe to YouTube TV but does rent movies through YouTube, though? I have to admit I feel a little caught in the crossfire.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

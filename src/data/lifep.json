    "body": "\n        \n        The security of a popular wifi router brand is under scrutiny from multiple federal agencies, and devices could be pulled from shelves in the United States in the future. According to reporting from the Washington Post, the US Department of Commerce has proposed a ban on routers from TP-Link Systems, a move that has now received support from Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Defense. What is the issue with TP-Link?The proposal reportedly stems from security concerns with routers sold by TP-Link Systems, which is in California but was spun off from the Chinese-based TP-Link Technologies. Commerce officials have warned that the devices handle sensitive data and may be subject to influence by the Chinese government. For example, there is concern that TP-Link is required to provide information to Chinese intelligence agencies and central government, which could in turn force software updates that compromise user data. (It is important to note that U.S.-based TP-Link Systems disputes this and says that only U.S. engineers can push patches to devices owned by U.S. customers.)\nThe interagency review of TP-Link actually began during the Biden administration—and this isn't the first action the federal government has taken against tech companies that have foreign ties. In June 2024, the Commerce Department banned sales of antivirus software from Russia's Kaspersky Lab to U.S. consumers.  Is my TP-Link router affected?Again, the proposal under consideration could ban future sales of TP-Link Systems routers to U.S. users. Existing devices from TP-Link have been targeted by threat actors and been subject to zero-day vulnerabilities, including a flaw that allowed full takeover. Of course, most internet-connected devices are vulnerable to hackers, and while some security experts express caution when it comes to TP-Link, there isn't unilateral support for tossing your router ASAP. Instead, you should continue to follow security best practices to protect your home network, such as changing default login credentials, enabling protective features like a firewall and encryption, and keeping your device's firmware up to date. If you do need to purchase a new router—if you stop renting from your internet service provider, for example—you might consider a different brand. Some estimates suggest that TP-Link's home routers make up as much as half of the market in the U.S. (though others put the numbers much lower). Many of those devices are sold or leased through ISPs. \n            ",

Technically, this also makes it clearer that the rule applies to everyone and not just those using the OpenAI API to build an app, but average users are unlikely to see a change.The important words here are \"provision\" and \"providing.\" The terms, as written, don't necessarily ban the average person from getting legal and health advice from ChatGPT, but instead discourages developers and hospitals or law offices from using the chatbot to give specific advice to a client without first checking in with a licensed professional. As an average person doing background research, you're unlikely to bump up against it, and there's no language indicating a change to the chatbot's functionality. In short, the update is intended as a rewording, not a change to rules, enforcement, or functionality.This is backed up by OpenAI's statement, which comes from the company's head of health AI Karan Singhal, and says \"ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information.\"Despite this, responses to OpenAI's statement denying a change to model behavior still claim to have seen more difficulty looking certain topics up, although it's important to note that OpenAI's release notes don't indicate any new model developments having been made since the update to the company's usage policies.On an anecdotal note, I was able to get ChatGPT to offer me advice on how to fight a traffic ticket in court, as well as suggest brands for a supplement a user said the model refused to provide specific advice about following the new policy update.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nWhile I cannot test every possible use case, the situation seems clear to me. Are you using ChatGPT or the OpenAI API to give others specifically tailored legal or health advice, without review by a licensed professional? If so, the same rules apply as before. If not, you're unlikely to see a change in your results.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

While these updates aren't as massive as iOS 26 or macOS 26 were, 26.2 includes a number of new features and changes, including the ability to add alarms to reminders, and changes to how Apple calculates the Apple Watch's new Sleep Score. Despite these fun adjustments, I couldn't recommend that users install the new updates on their personal devices. Three days later, I still don't recommend it, but I won't necessarily dissuade you from it either, as the public betas for both updates are now available. Developer vs. public betasBefore Apple releases any major software update to the general public, it first tests that software with smaller pools of users. This is known as beta testing. The company will first release a beta specifically designed for developers, which these devs can install on their devices to see how their apps perform with the upcoming update. They can then report any and all issues they encounter to Apple, who will fix those bugs with future beta updates.After a short period of developer-only testing, Apple then releases the public beta. This beta is meant for any Apple user who feels a bit daring and wants to try new features early. The trade-off is that the software is not yet finished, so those users may still run into problems, which they can then report to Apple. Based on that feedback, Apple continues to fine-tune the update, and once it appears to be stable, it releases it to the general public. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn the past, Apple locked the developer beta behind its paid developer program, which costs $99. If you didn't pay, you couldn't access the developer beta, so you were either stuck waiting for the slightly more stable public beta, or finding the dev beta file somewhere on the internet. That latter option opens users up to malware, which could be why Apple dropped the paid requirement for the dev beta. Now, anyone who registers their Apple Account as a developer—regardless of whether or not they've paid to be in the developer program—can download and install the developer beta.You've technically been able to run the 26.2 betas since Tuesday, if you wanted to go down that route. However, due to the nature of beta testing, the developer beta (and the first one at that) is the riskiest beta to install. It's Apple's first attempt at the beta, which means it's largely untested. You might run into device-breaking problems, and without a proper backup, you could lose valuable information. While all betas carry risk, the public beta is at least tested enough to root out any of those critical flaws. While I don't recommend you run any betas on your personal devices, most of us don't have spare iPhones and Mac lying around to run tests on. As such, if you're going to install a beta, now's the time to do it.How to install iOS and macOS 26.2Before you install a beta on your iPhone or Mac, make sure you've first properly backed up your important information. That means making a full backup of your iPhone on your Mac or PC, or a backup of your Mac information on a separate hard drive. If something goes wrong during beta testing, you'll need to downgrade back to iOS 26.1 or macOS 26.1—and if you don't have a proper backup, you'll need to restore your device to factory settings to do it. Again, there are real risks here. If you're okay with those risks, and you made the proper backups, enroll your Apple Account in the public beta program.

    "body": "\n        \n        As a tech journalist, I've got Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS devices at home—not because I'm especially wealthy, but because I need to write about all of these platforms, all of the time—and it's my trusty Chromebook that I find myself turning to more often than not.The usual argument against Chromebooks is that they're just a Chrome browser: Windows and macOS give you the same Chrome browser, and much more besides. However, sometimes less is more, as I'll get to below. Sadly, it seems Google is less keen on Chromebooks than I am. The last Google-made Pixelbook launched in 2019, and it's been left to the likes of Asus, Acer, HP, Samsung, and others to keep new Chromebooks coming in. If you're reading, Google, it's high time we had a new Pixelbook.\nChromebooks cut down on the clutterThere is the argument that Windows and macOS give you the Chrome browser plus a lot more, but most of the time, I don't really need the \"more\"—unless I've got some detailed image edits to do, or want to play some games. Almost everything I need runs on the web.There are a lot fewer software updates, background programs, app assistants, and system utilities to think about. While ChromeOS does have updates, they're mostly done seamlessly in the background, and applied whenever you next reboot your Chromebook.Another chore I don't have to regularly take care of on my Chromebook is tidying up the desktop or my local folders, because there isn't really anything to download, save, or sync. The laptop file system and internal storage is tidier by default, because I never use it.Chromebooks save everything instantly\n    \n            \n            No save button required.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAll the work I do on my Chromebook is inside a browser, and usually inside Google apps like Google Docs and Gmail. That means everything is instantly saved—should a power cut or a system crash happen, I don't have to worry about losing what I've been working on.I don't need to check for open programs and files in the background that I might have forgotten about, and if I need to jump up and do something else quickly, I can just shut my laptop and I'm done—I'm not clicking through dozens of save dialogs first.Chromebooks put everything on the webWhen you're working inside web apps all the time, without the option of locally installed tools, syncing is seamless. To work on a document that I need to access across Windows and macOS, for example, I need to think about saving, syncing, and app compatibility.When I'm working in Google Docs in a Chromebook, everything syncs automatically. I can even have a document open simultaneously across ChromeOS, Windows, and macOS, and jump between them as needed to make edits—something which saves a lot of time.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChromebooks tie in tightly to the Google ecosystem\n    \n            \n            Android phones and Chromebooks play nicely together.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI can understand that Chromebooks may have less appeal if you're not always using Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Google Docs, Chrome, and everything else Google makes—but for someone heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (like me), they make a lot of sense.If you've got an Android phone, for example, you can use it to set up a Chromebook, share files across both devices, respond to text messages from ChromeOS, and get hotspot access with a click. There's a level of integration you don't get on other platforms.Chromebooks actually work as distraction-free devicesOne of the criticisms leveled at Chromebooks is that they're pretty much useless without an internet connection, but that's only partly true. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and even Gmail actually work perfectly well offline now.If I'm traveling without steady wifi, I enjoy using my Chromebook as a distraction-free device, getting through a ton of writing and email replying without constantly switching tabs. When wifi returns, everything I've done gets synced back to the web automatically. While we're on the subject of ChromeOS being useless when it's not online, I think it's fair to say internet access is almost ubiquitous now (via public wifi or phone hotspots), and that Windows and macOS aren't particularly useful either when the web is cut off.\n            ",

I love my M1 iMac, but I worry that Apple's first version of this new update isn't quite optimized for the five-year-old chip, and have been waiting to see if a future version of Tahoe performs a bit better. As it happens, that next version is now here—and does seem improved, at that. Apple has been beta testing macOS Tahoe 26.1 alongside iOS 26.1 since September, and officially released it on Monday, Nov. 3. The update only just dropped, but thanks to the beta testing period, we know what features Apple has in store for Mac users who decide to install 26.1. This is a much smaller revision than macOS 26, but the update does bring some interesting new features for users to explore. Control over Liquid Glass' appearanceBy far the most striking difference between this year's Apple updates and last year's is Liquid Glass. This new design language is Apple's most drastic UI change in years, and while some people love it, others hate it. I've enjoyed the new look on my iPhone, but I understand why some users dislike how some elements let the background shine through, in some cases reducing visibility.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nApple seems to have taken the criticism to heart: With macOS Tahoe, as well as iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1, the company now gives users the option to control how Liquid Glass looks, at least to a degree. The new toggle, which you can find in System Settings >  Appearance, has two options: \"Clear,\" which retains the original look of Liquid Glass, and \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of your system's UI elements. With Tinted, you won't see as much of the background poke through, and whatever does come through doesn't take over the overlayed element as much. If you find Liquid Glass in macOS Tahoe too clear and \"glassy,\" this might be a good option to try. Expanded support for Apple Music AutoMix Apple's latest round of updates introduced a new DJ-like feature to Apple Music. AutoMix will automatically build a transition between songs, fading one song into another. It's a cool feature (when it works well), and can make transitioning between dissimilar songs a lot smoother.With macOS 26.1, AutoMix now works over AirPlay. Previously, you lost this feature when beaming your music to an AirPlay device.Better FaceTime audio qualityApple says that Mac users updating to 26.1 should experience improved FaceTime audio quality in low-bandwidth conditions. The company doesn't elaborate, but this is good news on its, uh, face: If you're calling someone in a low-signal area, or with a weak wifi connection, you should be able to hear each other better.Communication Safety and Web content filters for child accountsIf your Mac has child accounts (made for ages 13 through 17), Communication Safety and Web content filters will be enabled by default for those accounts after updating to this latest version. These filters are designed to limit adult websites, protecting underage users from content they shouldn't be accessing. A new Network iconAs spotted by the MacOSBeta subreddit, Apple has updated the Network icon for macOS 26.1. The new icon looks great, in my opinion, sporting a blue theme with glow effects:\nA new Macintosh HD iconSimilarly, the Macintosh HD icon gets a small refresh. The original Tahoe icon was a major redesign over the previous, iconic icon. Now, Apple has removed the additional elements to simplify the design. (I still miss the original.) \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nA few security updates, probablyApple hasn't announced security updates for macOS 26.1 yet, but in all likelihood, they will. Apple doesn't often issue true security patches like other companies, barring an emergency patch. Instead, the company usually bundles its security patches within point updates like 26.1. Once the official update drops, expect Apple to update its security release notes to include details about these patches.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

When you don’t get all your tasks done, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and disappointed in yourself, which doesn’t help you push through to finish those tasks, let alone feel like you’re thriving.You should be happy. You need to be productive. Reaching a state of zen can help you accomplish both—or so goes the theory behind the “Zen to Done” method, which aims to help you get more good and feel good about it. Unlike some other productivity approaches, this one has less to do with strict deadlines and weedy details than it does with pushing through and feeling good about a job well done. This makes it well suited to those who don't exactly blossom under pressure.What is Zen to Done?Zen to Done is a productivity system conceptualized by Zen Habits’ Leo Babauta. It’s structured around building simple habits that enable you to get your work done and feel good at the same time. Other methods, like the once ubiquitous “Getting Things Done” system, get a bad rap for expecting you to build all your new habits at once, jumping immediately into a whole new lifestyle. That sort of all-or-nothing change can work for some people, but it might not be for you. But ZTD is focused on building them incrementally and more peacefully. There's room to adjust and grow, which can be soothing—especially if you have a lot of habits to change or you're particularly stuck in your ways.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe habit changes come in a series, but one at a time, allowing you to focus on the actual work you need to get done. In the original version of ZTD, there are 10 habits, but you should only try to incorporate two to three of them at one time before moving on to others.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCollect by always taking notes about what you need to do, ideas you have, or changes to a task or project.Process by making quick decisions on tasks that are in front of you right now, like emails that could soon pile up. Plan by setting goals for your week every Monday, and tackling larger tasks earlier in the week.Do by selecting a task and focusing on it without thinking about or doing anything else. Create a simple trusted system that works for you, like doing certain tasks at the same time every day or tapping into an email system like the 4Ds with consistenc.Organize by giving everything a place—and putting it there every time. This goes for emails, tools on your desk, and anything else that’s cluttering your mind or space. Review your weekly goals at the end of the week, but also keep tabs on your longer-term quarterly or annual goals to keep them fresh in your mind and see how your daily work plays into them. Simplify by using your review time to slash your goals and tasks into only what’s most essential at any given time. Make a routine that works for you, whether it’s a calmer morning routine, or  more structured evenings—and absolutely stick to it. Find your passion and make sure it’s guiding your work. This is where ZTD differs from other productivity methods: You should always strive to keep the things you care about at the center of what you’re doing, as a reminder of why you’re working so hard or a check on whether a project is really worth it all.Over the past year, I've adopted a few of these changes: collect (and, by extension, plan), plus process and organize. I've been dedicated to growing financially and becoming more organized, but I knew neither of those things would happen overnight, so I started writing down \"to-dos\" whenever they popped into my head. I stick them in a note in my phone, reorganize the note every Monday, and check it every morning to see what I can do—then jump straight into the things that are attainable in that moment. The other day, I noticed my fan was dirty but I didn't have time to clean it write then, so I wrote a note—clean the fan—in my phone, and was able to follow up on it the next day without stressing. Making changes and getting things done bit by bit in this way has resulted in major financial wins and a significantly cleaner, more organized home. It's a far cry from how things went in the past, when I put too much pressure on myself to change instantly. Get started with “Minimalist ZTD”All of that sounds like a lot—and it is, even though you’re only supposed to start rolling in the habits one at a time. So pull back a bit: Babauta considers the first four (collect, process, plan, and do) the core of a “Minimalist ZTD” program, and advises picking one of them and focusing on it for 30 days. After a month, you’ll be in the habit of using that approach to your work and can move on to one of the other three. And once the four big are securely ingrained in your habits, you can move on to the full list.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

It was a clever way of ensuring than your iPhone didn't unlock in your pocket, or due to an accidental touch. With iOS 10, Apple killed slide to unlock in favor of pressing the Home button, then later swiping up on the bottom of the screen. Since then, for the better part of a decade, swiping right on the Lock Screen simply takes you to the \"Today View,\" which contains your widgets. Change is good, and I don't necessarily think Apple should bring back slide to unlock for the Lock Screen, but sometimes, I miss how things worked on my old iPhone 3GS. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. To my absolute surprise, however, the company is bringing back the slide function—just not to unlock. Instead, you're now able to slide to stop your alarms, which might come as a surprise to anyone used to the usual alarm routine. Imagine it: One morning, you're tapping to turn off your alarm as usual; the next, your taps are fruitless, and your alarm keeps blaring. Bleary-eyed, you look at your screen, to find a new \"Slide to stop\" function. If you're like me, you'll follow instructions, sliding to stop the alarm, only to forget the whole ordeal within moments, doomed to repeat the affair the next morning. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis change arrives as part of iOS 26.1, which dropped on Monday, and Apple doesn't give you any say in the matter—at least, not at first. After updating to the latest update, your next alarm or timer will include the next slider (though \"snooze\" or \"repeat\" remain buttons), but the switch up is fine by me. I like it, and it brings back a fun feature from iOS' heyday. But if you dislike the change, and you wish you could simply tap a button to silence your alarms and timers, the good news is, you still can. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to disable \"slide to stop alarm\"Apple buried the option to revert your alarm and timers back to the way they used to be, so I wouldn't blame you for not knowing they even exist. You won't find them in the Clock app's settings page, which is confusing. Instead, it's part of a hidden system-wide setting, called \"Prefer Single-Touch Actions.\"  This setting will disable sliders across iOS, and replace them with buttons. For our purposes, that turns \"Slide to stop\" back into a simple off button. To find it, head to Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then enable the toggle next to \"Prefer Single-Touch Action.\" \n    \n            \n            Slide to stop (left) vs. stop button (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

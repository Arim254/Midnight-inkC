I love stock Android, and I'm always running the latest Android beta, making Pixel basically my only choice. But there are times when I get jealous looking at all the extra tools that Samsung provides on its Galaxy phones, Edge Panel being the big one. With Edge Panel, you can swipe in from the edge of your phone and a hidden drawer reveals itself, filled with apps, system actions, and shortcuts. Given how barebones Pixel Launcher is, I've always wanted something like this. Then I found the Panels app by Fossor Coding (not to be confused with the ill-fated wallpaper app by MKBHD).In some ways, Panels is even better than Edge Panels on Samsung. It lets you use custom icon packs, there's a quick search shortcut, and you can even open floating widgets. Plus, because it's customizable, you can move the trigger point to the bottom edge of your phone instead of the side (incredibly handy for large phones), and you can add multiple columns (up to a ridiculous seven column layout). And while you can pay for Panels, all of that basic functionality is included for free.How to customize the Panels app for AndroidFirst, install the app and give it permission to display over other apps; this makes sure that the Panels launcher can work when you're using any app.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNext, tap on the View button and customize the panel. The free version limits you to 3 columns and 9 rows, which seems like plenty to me. You can upgrade to the full version to remove this limit (which is quite cheap, at just $1.50). From the Trigger section, you can customize the trigger area. If you have a larger phone, I highly recommend bringing down the trigger area towards the bottom of the screen.Now, let's customize the Panels launcher itself. Swipe in from your trigger area and hold for a second to bring up the sidebar panel. By default, you'll see some apps here already. Tap and hold on an empty area to start adding more apps.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nYou can choose to add any of the following items:Applications: Choose any installed app. Add your most frequently used apps here.Shortcuts: Launch actions from inside any supported apps. For example, you can create a shortcut for adding a new task in TickTick, or messaging someone on WhatsApp.App pair: Create shortcuts for launching two apps side-by-side, made even more useful after Android 16's latest 90:10 split screen update.Accessibility: Add shortcuts for system-level options like Home, Back, Notifications, Screenshot, and more.System preferences: Quick access to frequently used settings like media volume, cellular data, airplane mode, Wi-Fi, and a lot more.Website: You can add any website as a quick shortcut here.Floating widget: This is a hidden gem. You can add widgets that open in a floating window above everything else. You can trigger widgets for news, weather, or sports updates. They can hover over everything else for a few seconds, before you dismiss them out of the way.Folder: If you have too many quick app options, organize them in folders instead.Contact: Add any contact here as an icon. Press and hold to quickly call, message, or email them.Quick Search: Another useful hack. The Quick Search panel brings up a fast search for all installed apps.Go over each option and choose what you'd like to add to your sidebar launcher. Me, I'm a simple man, so my focus is mostly on my most frequently used apps, shortcuts for common actions, and quick access to some system level functionality.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOne swipe gesture: Lastly, here's a pro tip. While you can open apps in Panels by swiping, lifting your thumb, and selecting, you can also do it without taking your thumb off the screen.Once you swipe in from the edge and the Panels sidebar opens up, don't let go. You can keep moving your thumb to highlight any app or shortcut (the icon that's in focus will get bigger). Then simply let go over your selection to launch it. Overall, Panels is a pretty robust app. Once you have your personalized setup, you can launch apps, shortcuts, or widgets, with just a swipe, no matter which app you're using.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

We are giving you a $5 credit towards your next month of service that can be redeemed after Jan 16 when paying with a credit card online. This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us. If you’re still having trouble connecting, please restart your device (power down and power back on).The amount may be smaller, but it does seem to be a bit more convenient to claim, since it sounds like you can apply it while paying your bill (although I can't make any promises for people using auto pay). Like Verizon's offer, it also doesn't seem to be discriminating between those affected by the outage and those who weren't, as noted by a user on Reddit.\nSome comments from other Visible subscribers on Reddit did point out that they had yet to receive the text, although I'm assuming that's due to a slow rollout more than anything else, as textless users who reached out to customer service were able to confirm they were offered the $5 credit as well. I've reached out to Visible to confirm if the $5 credit applies to everyone, and will update this post when I hear back (I also asked if it would be applied to automatic payments).As for why the payment is so much smaller, it's probably due to the difference in cost between Verizon and Visible. Verizon said it based its $20 payout on the price for \"multiple days of service,\" and frankly, those same days cost much less on Visible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile Visible uses the same network as Verizon, it sets itself apart by giving its users lower priority while connecting, which lets it offer unlimited plans starting at $20/month. Prices range to $33/month, but essentially, $5 goes a lot further on the low cost network, meaning it represents a similar value to $20 for a proper Verizon plan.Whether that's a fair price for an unexpected day of spotty connectivity, I'll leave up to you.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you enter your debit or credit card into one of these fake card readers, your data is stored for later download or transmitted wirelessly in real time to a device controlled by scammers, who will use the information to steal from your accounts. Unfortunately, online shoppers aren't immune from this scheme. Web skimming is a type of cyberattack that uses malicious code to steal card data during checkout, and researchers have identified an ongoing campaign targeting major payment providers and, by extension, consumers. Online credit card skimmingWeb skimming attacks, broadly referred to as \"Magecart\" campaigns, are initiated when malicious JavaScript is injected into e-commerce websites and payment portals. When a checkout page loads, the skimmer replaces it with a spoofed form that collects card numbers, expiry dates, card verification codes, and billing or shipping addresses—everything threat actors need to turn around and use your card for fraudulent purchases. \nThe fake payment forms use legitimate-looking branding and styling to minimize suspicion. Once payment details are transmitted to the attacker, the user gets an error message and is redirected to the real checkout page, a flow designed to make you believe that you've simply entered your information incorrectly. Web skimmers are typically designed to avoid detection and may even self-destruct, making them difficult to identify even for site admins. They also utilize bulletproof hosting, which shields cyber actors from takedown requests and law enforcement action. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect your payment cardUnfortunately, consumers can't do much about the presence of web skimmers, but they can play defense against them. Red flags of an online shopping scam are also red flags for skimming—for example, deals and discounts that are too good to be true are indicators of a possible fraudulent vendor or malicious site, where you may be more likely to have your card details stolen. Shopping with reputable vendors will reduce (though not entirely eliminate) the risk. You should also be vigilant about any unusual steps during checkout, such as redirects or error messages, and abandon any suspicious transactions. If you suspect that your payment details may have been stolen, keep an eye on your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized activity, and enable transaction alerts for real-time updates. Remember that credit cards offer more security protections than debit cards. You could also use virtual cards for online purchases, which allows you to keep your actual card details private and protect you from further fraud. (Note, however, that virtual cards have some drawbacks. For example, you may lose some protections offered by your primary card provider and have a tougher time obtaining refunds.)\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The wireless carrier's coverage was down for large swaths of the country for much of the day, leading to confusion, frustration, and, for some, conspiracy theories. I saw some users on X post cryptic messages like \"This is how it starts,\" and \"These are the end times.\" It's good to know in times of service disruption, we can all keep a level head. But despite claims to the contrary, the world didn't end yesterday, and Verizon fixed the issue. The company issued a statement at 10:20 p.m. ET, confirming the outage had been resolved, and that Verizon would contact affected customers directly to issue account credits. While that doesn't necessarily make up for a full day of network downtime, at least Verizon users can get back online and make calls when not connected to wifi.But some customers out there aren't back to normal. In fact, they're still seeing the same \"SOS\" alert on their phones they saw yesterday. For these users, the outage is very much still happening, as they cannot access the internet or communicate with others without either going through satellite connectivity, or finding a wifi connection. When you need to be out and about, especially on the road, that isn't an option. \nHow to get your Verizon phone out of SOS mode Luckily, there's a simple solution here, one that Verizon shared in its post about the outage's resolution: restart your phone. It doesn't matter if you already restarted your phone yesterday during the outage: In order to see results, you'll need to power off your phone and turn it back on after Verizon implemented its fix. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDifferent smartphones have different restart methods, but here are some tips for the most popular models:Restarting an iPhone: Press and hold one of the volume buttons together with the side (power) button, until you see the power-off slider. Slide to power off, then wait for the screen to go totally black. After about 30 seconds, you can press and hold the side button to power it back on. Note: If your iPhone has a Home button, you can simply press and hold the side button to pull up the power-off slider.  Restarting a Samsung Galaxy: Press and hold the volume down button and side button until you see power options appear. Here, choose \"Restart,\" then tap \"Restart\" again. Restarting a Pixel: If you have a Pixel 6 or newer, press and hold the volume up button and side button for a few seconds, then tap \"Restart\" when it appears. If you have a Pixel 5 or older, simply hold the side button until the phone restarts.If your phone model isn't listed here, you can search the internet for specific instructions on how to restart it. Typically, though, the process involves holding both the side button and one of the volume buttons.   \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The music streaming service is sending emails to customers letting them know about yet another price hike coming next month.To Spotify's credit, the price hike is pretty minor. But starting on whatever your February billing date is, individual premium plans will jump from $11.99/month to $12.99/month, while student plans will go from $5.99/month to $6.99/month. More extensive plans will see a slightly more costly jump. The Duo plan, which gives premium access to two people at the same address, is going from $16.99/month to $18.99/month. The Family plan, which gives premium access to up to six people at the same address, will also see a $2 increase, now costing $21.99/month rather than $19.99/month.\nThe price hikes are set to affect the U.S., Estonia, and Latvia, according to Spotify's announcement. The company's rationale for all this? According to the post, \"occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers.\"Truthfully, $1 to $2 does seem like a pretty minor change, but the update follows another U.S. price hike in 2024, where Individual plans went up by $1, Duo plans went up by $2, and Family plans went up by $3. And that came after a price hike in 2023, where the Individual, Student, and Family plans went up by $1, while the Duo plan went up by $2. Certain subscribers outside of the U.S. also saw their own price increases in 2025. I can't help but feel like a frog in a slowly boiling pot.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe continual barrage of price hikes is a bit of a disappointment for subscribers who had gotten used to a steady price for Spotify since its U.S. launch in 2011, as the service went for 12 years before its first price change. If all these price hikes are starting to get to you, you might be able to get around them. If you can find one at a store near you, you can pay upfront for a discounted annual subscription using a Spotify gift card, although it won't apply to Spotify's Family or Student plans. Unfortunately, Spotify does not have an annual subscription plan available on its website.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Do you wish you could take care of all those updates at once? Updatest is an application made for exactly this.I've talked about Homebrew for Mac, which is a command line tool for installing and updating Mac software. Updatest scans all the software on your computer and updates it using Homebrew, even if you didn't initially install it that way. But there's more. Many applications use an open source tool called Sparkle to offer updates, and Updatest can find and update all of them. The application can also identify applications downloaded from GitHub that have newer releases, along with any application you downloaded from the Mac App Store.Basically, if an application has updates, Updatest can find them and install them for you. To get started, click the download button on the app's website (you can also install using Homebrew, if you've already set that up). The application will tell you a bit about how it works, ask you which categories of applications you want to update using the tool, and offer to install Homebrew if you haven't done that already.\nOnce you're done with all of that, you will see a list of all the applications on your system. You can filter to see only the apps that need updates, if you want.Click any application to learn more about the update. From here you can install the update. Alternatively, you can click the Bulk Update button below the search bar to update all of your outdated applications at once. You can watch the updates happen by clicking the Terminal button in the top-right corner, or you can let the application do its thing while you work on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome updates require passwords, in which case you'll be asked to run the update command in the Terminal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd in some cases, applications from the Mac App Store won't update—in my tests, this was mostly iPad apps I've installed. The application will instead give you a link to open the App Store and install the update.These minor annoyances are inevitable, and not too burdensome. And it's nice to be able to check all of my applications for updates in once place. If you're interested, there's a 15-day free trial, allowing you to get a feel for how the application works. After that you can buy a personal license, which works on up to three Macs, for $9.99; a household license, which works on up to 10 Macs, costs $19.99.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make. Despite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.  Parents can still supervise their 13 year olds' Google Accounts Luckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\") \nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out. Speaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does this mean for my child's Google Account?As I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.But now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end. It's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Discovery, it seems the company is actually adding new features to its subscription service. Netflix is always adding new shows and movies, which is what most users are looking for in the platform, but that's not all you can expect from your account. In fact, Netflix is now rolling out an interactive experience for its live competition shows, allowing subscribers to cast votes in real-time. Live voting comes to Star SearchNetflix announced the change in a press release on Tuesday, and also revealed the first show to officially run with real-time voting: Star Search. Netflix is bringing back the American Idol precursor tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT), and will allow viewers to choose which contestant they like best alongside \"millions of others.\"  Netflix says it first tested the feature with the show Dinner Time Live with David Chang, and \"learned firsthand how members appreciated the seamless and integrated ways they could participate in the series.\" I don't think you need a focus group to know that people like sharing their opinions on things, but then, I'm not a Netflix exec. \nThe company clarified in its press release that only live events will work with real-time voting. If you watch a show after it airs, you won't be able to cast your vote—which, obviously, makes sense. The show doesn't really need to know who you'd pick as a winner after the winner has already been chosen—though Netflix could always use the extra user data, I'm sure. Star Search is the only show at this time that supports this feature, but Netflix says more real-time voting shows are on the way.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to vote in live Netflix events\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Netflix\n                    \n    \nNetflix says that when you watch a live event, you'll be able to vote when watching on TV or a streaming device. You won't be able to vote if you're watching in a web browser, nor will you be able to vote if you rewind, pause, or tune-in late. When you join a live program, make sure you do so on a smart TV, supported streaming device (such as Apple TV, Fire TV, or Roku), or the Netflix mobile app. If you want to watch in a web browser, you can still vote on your phone at the same time.

As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.Verizon credit phishing scamAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website. If you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it. \nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Right now, the Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 laptop and tablet is $1,549.99 (originally $ 1,999.99), bringing it to 23% off and its lowest price ever, according to price-trackers.\nThis laptop-tablet hybrid is a shining example of how versatile a PC can be and is a smart option for students, frequent travelers, or people who only need a keyboard occasionally. In laptop mode, it works like a standard clamshell for typing, but can be folded back flat and used with the included S Pen in tablet mode. It also has in-between tent and stand modes, which let you prop it up to watch movies in bed or on a plane or for presentations where you don’t want the keyboard in the way. It comes with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD and uses an Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 258V that’s designed for effective everyday performance and AI tasks. The 8-core Lunar Lake chip is built for thin, lightweight laptops and 2-in-1s, and this Windows Pro 11 model is rated for up to 24 hours of battery life. The 16-inch 3K AMOLED touchscreen boasts a high resolution and accurate, vivid colors, though some reviewers note that the keyboard is a little softer and less “clicky” than they’d like. Its durable aluminum design weighs just 3.72 pounds and is 12.7mm thick, rivaling the weight of the 15-inch MacBook Air (around 3.3 lbs). AI-optimized Copilot+ enhancements add functionality as a business laptop, depending on how much you use AI in your day-to-day. You can also sync a Galaxy phone to access features like call, text, and AI tools. With a 120Hz refresh rate, it also delivers smooth scrolling, video playback, and casual gaming.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUltimately, if you’re looking for a premium and ultra-portable 2-in-1 PC laptop with seamless performance, a vibrant high-res touch screen, and lots of memory and storage, the Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 is a versatile workhorse works well for both business and creative tasks, especially if you’re already part of the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem and can grab it at its current $450 discount.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.How age prediction for ChatGPT worksOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.Here's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\nWhat's restricted in the \"safer\" version of ChatGPTThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:Graphic violence or goreViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"Role play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in natureSelf-harm descriptionsContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming The company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.AI isn't always great at age predictionThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.I'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.I don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The Beats Pill speaker has all these features and more, making it a great choice, and it has dropped in price to $99.95 (down from $149.95), matching the lowest price it has reached since its recent release, according to price-tracking tools. For less than a hundred dollars, this speaker is a steal.\nI've been trying out the Beats Pill speaker since it came out in summer 2024, and it has everything I could want in a portable speaker: stereo sound when connected to another compatible speaker, multi-room mode to play the same music on multiple speakers, the Find My Device feature in case you misplace it during a rager, and Class 1 Bluetooth for extended range.Apple users will get the most out of the Pill, with seamless iOS compatibility for a smoother experience. (You can read about it in more detail on PCMag's \"excellent\" review), but this Beats speaker is not just for Apple users: Android users can also connect to it with a Bluetooth 5.3 connection, but it only supports AAC and SBC codecs, so there are no Android-friendly codec options that will make the audio really pop.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes to battery life, you can expect around 24 hours per charge, depending on your use, which is comparable to other speakers of its size. It has that classic, bright Beats sound signature, balanced yet bass-heavy. It is rated IP67 dust-proof and waterproof, so it can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. The biggest downside is that there is no adjustable EQ within the app, but that's less important when it sounds so great out of the box.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

A versatile option for both multi-tasking at work and casual gaming, it’s currently 33% off at $799 (originally $1,199).\nThis entry-level gaming monitor is ultra-wide (32:9) with a Dual QHD display (5,120 x 1,440) with HDR400 support, a height-adjustable stand, and built-in speakers, which maximize your desk space even more. While its giant display with tons of usable space is the main draw, its 120Hz refresh rate offers smooth visuals and fast reactions, but may not suffice for pro-gamers who need an ultra-fast 240Hz-plus performance for competitive play. VESA DisplayHDR 400 gives you solid color accuracy and brightness, though it can’t match the contrast of an OLED panel, and users may experience a slight gamma shift at the edges of this panel due to its width. USB-C with up to 90 W charging and a KVM Switch, which allows users to connect and control two sources to the display at the same time from a single keyboard and mouse, makes it an effective dock-style hub for laptops and desktops. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re looking more screen real estate in a single monitor, smoother visuals than a basic office monitor, and an option that you can toggle between both during work and after hours for your gaming needs, the Samsung 49-inch ViewFinity S95UC monitor may not be the fastest or HDR-impressive compared to higher-end OLED models. But at around $800, this ultra-wide display is a capable, all-in-one alternative to a dual-monitor setup that also helps you reclaim more desk space.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

A new spyware platform known as ZeroDayRAT is reportedly being sold on Telegram, complete with customer support and updates. According to mobile security company iVerify, this aggressive spyware grants full remote control over devices running Android 15 through 16 and iOS versions up to iOS 26. Once deployed, it allows everything from user profiling and location tracking to live surveillance and financial theft. What ZeroDayRAT can gather from your deviceThis spyware has wide-ranging capabilities that, according to iVerify, have traditionally been found on platforms sponsored by state actors. Here's a look at what ZeroDayRAT can do: \nCollect information about the device, such as model, OS, battery, country, lock status, SIM and carrier info, app usage, live activity, and SMS message previews. This allows threat actors to develop user profiles for further targeting.Pull GPS coordinates, capture notifications from apps and systems, and harvest account information, such as usernames and emails. Send SMS messages and receive verification codes to bypass two-factor authentication. Log keystrokes (including biometric unlocks, gestures, and app launches), access the camera and microphone, and screen record.  Log crypto wallet addresses and target banking and payment app credentials via overlay attacks. How to protect against spywareZeroDayRAT can infect your device only if a malicious binary—an APK on Android or iOS payload—is downloaded and installed. These may be distributed through phishing, such as links sent via emails, texts, or messaging platforms, as well as in fake app stores. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll standard guidance for avoiding scams and malware applies: never click links in unsolicited communication, including conversations in apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, and only download apps and extensions from official, trusted sources. Users at high risk of being targeted and anyone who wants an extra layer of security can consider enabling Lockdown Mode (iOS) or Advanced Protection (Android). \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men. Carefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight. Men can have eating disorders, tooBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness. Unfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"Unsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent. We all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.What’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.Unattainable beauty standards stay unattainableBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation.  “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty  regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor. What does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.As a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.The bottom lineThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement? Women have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.\n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Meredith Dietz\n                                    Senior Staff Writer\n                                \n                                            Covering personal fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Meredith's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Meredith\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Your iPhone will detect and hide spam messages, and with the Screen Unknown Senders feature, you can filter out texts from anyone you don't know. You can also disable push notifications for these conversations to reduce how often you're alerted for messages you don't need to see. Note that this feature works only on iOS, so if you have Messages synced on your Mac, you'll see everything and receive notifications for all messages unless you mute specific conversations. How to reduce clutter in Messages on iOSTo send messages from numbers you don't know to a separate folder, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and toggle on Screen Unknown Senders. You can also get here through the Messages app on your iPhone by tapping the three horizontal menu lines in the top-right corner and selecting Manage Filtering. Enabling Screen Unknown Senders will hide notifications and move messages to your Unknown Senders list. If you want to allow (or disallow) certain types of notifications, tap Allow Notifications and toggle categories on or off: \nTime Sensitive includes alerts, verification codes, and urgent requests. Personal includes messages identified as not sent by a business or organization. Transactions include order updates, receipts, and confirmations. Promotions include general offers and updates sent to multiple recipients. Most users will want to enable time-sensitive notifications to receive messages that include time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) and other urgent alerts. You may also want to allow personal notifications so you don't miss messages directed to you individually from real people who aren't saved in your contacts.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen you allow notifications, texts identified in those categories will appear in your Messages list for only 12 hours before being moved to Unknown Senders—a behavior that keeps your primary inbox streamlined. If you want to make an unknown sender a known sender to prevent future messages from being filtered out, open the conversation and tap Mark as Known at the bottom or add the number to your contacts. A known sender is anyone you've added to your Contacts, sent a message to, or marked as known in the conversation. Finally, if you enable Filter Spam under the same menu in your device settings, Apple will send messages identified as spam to a separate Spam list and hide notifications. You can view these and conversations from unknown senders at any time via Messages > Menu. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Now Malwarebytes has joined the ChatGPT app store, which means you can get some expert help when investigating web links, emails, text messages, domains, and phone numbers you think might be suspicious.The app is free to use for everyone, whether or not they're signed up to a paid ChatGPT subscription, and you can enable the tool via the ChatGPT app store or by entering the prompt \"Malwarebytes, is this a scam?\" Once you've used the app for the first time, you can access it again via the + (plus) button on the prompt box.Malwarebytes' ChatGPT app can test links, sites, and phone numbers\n    \n            \n            Malwarebytes will do a deep security dive into links you provide.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can paste just about anything you like into a conversation with the Malwarebytes plugin, but there are certain approaches that scammers will often take—including links contained in phishing emails—that make for good candidates to test this thing out. I dived deep into my email spam folder to find some URLs to test Malwarebytes on, and gave it a few trustworthy web addresses as well—you just copy the link into the prompt box and ask the app for an assessment.\nMalwarebytes successfully sifted out the scam links from the safe ones, even when it didn't have any specific information in its databases about the links I was providing. When it was unsure, it said so, with lots of extra context: For example, for one URL I was told the address was \"a legitimate email security and tracking service used by companies to rewrite links\" but one that scammers also used to conceal the link destination.You also get an assessment of the domain name: When given a link to a Lifehacker article, the plugin correctly identified that it was a legitimate domain with a registered owner, even though it didn't have any specific information about the URL. Malwarebytes was also able to spot domain redirecting, a trick frequently used by scammers.Phone numbers can be given to Malwarebytes as well: When I tested this out with a few scam calls I've had, these numbers were correctly identified as coming from scammers or at least being suspicious. I like the way the app gives you some context to its thinking (explaining how spam call centers work, for example), and will also offer up advice about next steps and how to stay safe.Something else I appreciated was that the Malwarebytes app has a memory inside ChatGPT: If you post a series of links and numbers in the same chat thread, as I did, then it will try and put them all in context (explaining why one URL is potentially more dangerous than another, for example).The Malwarebytes ChatGPT app can also look at messages and emails\n    \n            \n            You'll get a list back of red flags in email and text message content.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can also give the Malwarebytes app some text you've come across in an email or text message and get a verdict on this too—you can even type in a transcript of a conversation you're having on the phone, if you want. The plugin will scan the text for phrasing that scammers often use and will alert you of any other red flags.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI tried this out with a variety of spammy text, and again Malwarebytes scored highly in terms of recognizing anything dodgy. As before, if it came across something it wasn't sure about, it would explain the reasons why and suggest some next steps. The responses also include some detail on why different scam approaches are taken and why they sometimes work, and how they might escalate—so if you get a message purporting to be from a family member asking for help, Malwarebytes tells you why these scams are common and how they're used to steal identities or money.It's an intelligent system, in that it'll ask you questions about the texts or emails you've received: If it's not sure about something, you'll be told about extra checks you can run (like looking at the \"reply to\" address on an email). However, the usual ChatGPT sycophancy does start to grate a bit, as you're constantly told that you're doing the right thing and that you're right to be suspicious.The app taps into Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence, so it should be able to keep you protected against the latest threats (making it more helpful than a Google search or just a regular ChatGPT query). From the examples I used at least, it comes across as a security tool that's accurate, comprehensive, and easy to use—one that's well worth keeping close at hand if you come across potential scams you're not sure about.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.OpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service. The company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.   \nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.

But it’s not just about aesthetics. These IP52-rated headphones come packed with 40mm drivers, hybrid ANC, and both USB-C and 3.5mm connectivity. They support high-res audio via LDAC, and Nothing’s companion app gives you both a basic and advanced EQ for fine-tuning sound. Battery life is impressive, too: 35 hours with ANC on, up to 80 without.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut the hardware alone doesn’t define the experience—Nothing’s control scheme is what makes these wireless headphones stand out. Instead of touch panels or clunky buttons, you get a satisfying volume scroll wheel (they call it the Roller), a multi-function Paddle for track navigation, and a customizable Button that can switch EQ profiles or noise modes. The tactile design takes a minute to learn, but once you do, it’s intuitive and genuinely useful. You also get spatial audio and multipoint Bluetooth support, which work well across Android and iOS. That said, comfort may vary. The earcups aren’t the softest for long sessions, and while they’re padded, the shape might not suit everyone. Performance-wise, the ANC handles low-end noise well (think airplane engines and AC hum) but struggles with sharper, unexpected sounds like clanging dishes or chatter nearby. The sound profile is punchy, especially with a bit of EQ tweaking in the app, but you’ll need to put in some effort if you want the best results, notes this PCMag review.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can see how long each track is, who performed it, and maybe even the song writing credits, but you don't know why the artist wrote the song, or what each song is supposed to mean. You can, of course, scour the internet, looking at articles and blogs to learn more about your favorite music—or, you can skim Spotify's new summary cards that offer fun facts about each track. Spotify announced the new feature, called \"About the Song,\" on Friday. The feature, which is launching in beta, is available in the app's Now Playing View. When you select it, you'll see story cards you can swipe through that tell you more about the song you're listening to. Spotify says the stories are summarized from \"third-party sources,\" and in my testing, I've seen sources like Hypebeast, Wikipedia, and fan sites. The company also tells me that \"some systems\" of the feature use machine learning to generate these summaries, which means About the Song is, in part, AI-generated.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nAs with many of Spotify's new features, About the Song is only available for Premium subscribers. At this time, it's also limited to English accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. If you pay for Spotify in one of these regions, the feature is exceptionally easy to find. When you're listening to a song, just scroll down on the page until you see the \"About the Song\" card. If you don't see it, that song likely doesn't support the feature. Some songs will only have one summary card, but others may have more. If so, you'll see icons in the top right of the card window telling you which card you're reading. You can swipe left on the card to open the next. \nI've seen songs with as many as four of these cards, though it's possible some songs have even more. Some of those are all summarized from the same source—say, one Wikipedia article—while others pull from multiple sources to generate multiple About the Song cards. There are thumbs-up and thumbs-down options on each card to rate the summary, implying these are AI-generated. The summaries appear to be static once generated though—when I quit the app and return, the summaries are the same. I'd be curious to know if the summaries are the same for everyone who chooses a song, or if they're generated for each individual listener.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify has had a busy week. On Thursday, one day before announcing \"About the Song,\" the company revealed its plans to start selling physical paper books, which sync with its digital audiobooks. The day before that, Spotify revamped its lyrics feature, including the option to download lyrics for offline viewing. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

They have superior immersive sound, larger drivers that produce richer sound, and bigger cups that avoid that dreaded ear-squishing feeling. Skullcandy is known for its wide range of over-ear headphones, and the Skullcandy Crusher Evo wireless headphones are a mid-range option known for their bass. Right now, they’re 52% off, down to their lowest price ever of $99.99 (originally $209.99).\nThe standout feature on these headphones is the extra bass drivers that beef up the dual 40mm drivers; it has a unique haptic bass slider that adds vibration to low frequencies, and you can crank it up if you want a more bass-heavy experience. Compared to on-ear headphones, which can lead to discomfort over time, the plush memory foam cups will let you comfortably game or listen to music and podcasts all day (or night) long. And despite the generous ear cups, they fold flat, making them fairly compact for over-ear headphones. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThey’re advertised as lasting an impressive 40 hours on a single charge; they take a little over three hours to fully charge, but just 10 minutes of charging will get you a solid four-hour top-up. They don’t offer premium features such as multi-device pairing or high-res codecs, and the lack of active noise cancellation may be a dealbreaker for some. However, if you’ve been on the hunt for comfy, long-lasting, bass-thumping headphones that deliver at around a $100 price point, the Skullcandy Crusher Evo wireless headphones are less expensive than many alternatives, and have a bass-tuning feature that’s hard to come across.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Presidents' Day Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Malwarebytes Labs has identified a new scam in which threat actors are using party invites to trick users into installing a remote access tool (RAT) that gives them full control over infected devices. (This specific campaign seems to be limited to the UK, but similar tactics could easily spread.) These malicious invites contain a ScreenConnect installerThe scam starts with an innocuous-looking email invitation with an informal \"Save the Date\" vibe that may appear to come from a friend or acquaintance. The message contains a link to \"View Invitation\" for event details. If you click through, you'll end up on a landing page with a bold \"You're Invited\" header and a button to download your invitation, but you don't actually need to take any further action—your browser automatically triggers the download of a .msi file, which is not actually a party invitation or RSVP form but an installer. The MSI silently installs ScreenConnect Client, a legitimate IT support tool that allows remote access into the user's machine. Once this connection is established, attackers have the ability to see your screen, control your mouse and keyboard, and upload or download files—even if you restart your computer. All of this happens in the background with no obvious indicators that a remote access tool has been installed and is now running, so victims are unlikely to have cause for concern. \nYou should know these remote access red flagsAs Malwarebytes points out, this scheme is successful because it relies on normal human behavior around a seemingly low-risk situation: opening an event invitation. What's unusual is that there's little pressure or urgency in the initial message. Instead, the landing page has language like \"a friend has sent you an invitation\" and \"I opened mine and it was so easy,\" which is a form of social proof that guides users to take the desired action. You should always be alert to unsolicited invites sent via regular email with a link to an external site as well as any communication that prompts you to download or install software. These days, invitations are commonly delivered through apps and digital services like Partiful, Paperless Post, Evite, or Apple Invites, which are generally more trustworthy than random emails with hyperlinked text. If you're unsure whether the invite is real, verify with the sender through another channel before clicking or downloading anything. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs mentioned, victims of this scam may not immediately notice that a RAT has been installed on their device. But there are some red flags, such as unexplained cursor movement or windows opening or closing on their own. You can check your machine for a file named \"RSVPPartyInvitationCard.msi\" or a service called ScreenConnect Client with additional random characters in the title.  If you've already downloaded ScreenConnect from a malicious invite, Malwarebytes recommends disconnecting from the internet and uninstalling the program immediately. Run a security scan to check your device for malware, and change important passwords from a separate device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

A brand-new model costs $449.99, so the savings are significant. In this case, “like-new” means Amazon has cleaned, inspected, and cleared the device to function like a new unit, just without the shrink wrap. That price gap makes this Scribe more approachable, especially if you were curious about combining an e-reader with a digital notebook but did not want to pay flagship-tablet money.\nThis is the Scribe with the Premium Pen bundled in, and paired with its 10.2-inch E Ink screen, it offers a nice balance of size and sharpness, with 300 ppi, and an adjustable cool to warm-toned front light, which helps during long reading sessions. But even with that crisp display, it’s still grayscale, and the lack of color does feel limiting when compared to competitors (if you’re curious about your options, PCMag has a comprehensive roundup of the best e-readers for 2026). The software has gotten better, though—note-taking now includes direct annotation on books via something called Active Canvas. Just don’t expect the fluidity of an iPad or Supernote. Also, according to this PCMag review, things like drawing arrows or circling aren’t supported, and even Amazon’s AI features (like cleaning up your notes or summarizing) feel a little half-baked, considering the Scribe’s price point.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, for pure reading, the Scribe still holds up. It’s light, looks good with its aluminum frame, has ample storage, and offers a battery that can last over two months with basic use. If you’re writing or sketching regularly, that drops to around three weeks—but even then, it’s more than respectable. You do need your own USB-C charging brick, though. And unless you like slippery backs, a case is basically required. At $278.99, this version makes more sense than it ever did at launch. Just know going in that while the writing feel is great, thanks to the paper-like texture of the screen, the software may not be as smooth or intuitive as you’d expect from a premium device trying to be both a digital notebook and Kindle.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The feature was intuitive, and to quote my colleague Jake Peterson, it's worked so seamlessly that it was almost like Quick Share and AirDrop \"were built this way from the beginning.\" But for other Android users, it continued to be business as usual, leading to awkward texts and emails to share files across iOS and Android. Now, though, Google confirmed it's working to bring AirDrop to other Android phones, too, including phones it doesn't make. At an event attended by Android Authority, Android Vice President of Engineering Eric Kay said, \"Last year, we launched AirDrop interoperability. In 2026, we're going to be expanding it to a lot more devices.\"To a degree, we kind of knew this was coming. While many Pixel only features are implemented via a special Pixel-only system component, Google added AirDrop compatibility to the Pixel 10 by upgrading Quick Share from a system level feature to a full-on app, with its own APK. That laid the groundwork for other Android phones to eventually get AirDrop compatibility of their own, since they can all use this app. For instance, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said in November that his team was \"already exploring\" adding AirDrop compatibility to Nothing phones, while chipmaker Qualcomm said it \"can't wait\" for the feature to be enabled on Snapdragon—commonly used in Samsung's Galaxy phones—in the \"near future.\"Now, it seems like the wait for AirDrop across the rest of Android won't be much longer. While Kay didn't give an exact timeline beyond 2026, he did say that Google is already \"working with our partners to expand it into the rest of the ecosystem, and you should see some exciting announcements very soon.\" That's it as far as official communication goes, but I've reached out to Google for additional comment and will update if I can snag more details. In the meantime, we do have a few possible dates where we could expect the feature to be announced.\nThe soonest might be the next Samsung Unpacked, where the company is expected to announce the S26 lineup of phones. According to rumors, that'll take place on Feb. 25, and it's not unusual for Google to make an appearance during Unpacked to discuss new features coming to Android that the new phones can take advantage of. Alternatively, Google might save the announcement for its next Google I/O event, which would likely be sometime in May. Or it could just drop the feature online without the fanfare of an official event.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEither way, I can't wait. I take a lot of photos on my phone for this job, and while sending them from my personal iPhone to my work Mac usually isn't an issue, getting them off an Android phone I might be reviewing can be a much bigger pain. As someone who's got an Android tablet, an iPhone, a MacBook, and a Windows PC all within 5 feet of me right now, anything that helps bridge these ecosystems together is a good move in my book.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

It's not hard to move your following list over; you can upload (almost) all of your old tweets if you want; and the scrolling and posting experience is almost identical to what you'll remember from the old days of Twitter. The only feature I've missed? Drafts.Finally, drafts have arrived. In a post to the official Bluesky account, the company announced that it's added drafts to the platform, and that they're rolling out now. To create a draft, just start writing a post, and instead of tapping the Post button, hit Cancel or Drafts instead and choose Save draft. What you've written will be saved as a draft that you can return to later. The feature works for pre-written threads, too (made using the + button on the post screen). To see your saved drafts, open a blank post and hit Drafts before typing anything else. You'll see a list of your stored drafts, and you can either tap on a draft to open it, or hit the three-dots button to the right of the drift and then Discard to delete it.Drafts were a big part of Twitter for me—not just because they helped save posts if my connection dropped in the middle of writing them, but because they also gave me some time to consider if I really wanted to post something before taking it live. It's a handy feature for a platform with such a small character limit, where it might be easy to toss a stray thought out into the ether without really knowing how it might land or if you've expressed yourself as well as you could have. \nI'm not alone, here: A common trend on Twitter was posting screenshots of draft libraries, to give your followers a peak at the half-formed ideas you didn't think were quite ready for prime time. It's a bit of culture I've missed in moving over to the new site, and I'm glad it's now possible once agin.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for where Bluesky could go next, responses to the drafts announcement include requests for more robust DMs or an edit button, although Bluesky staffers have expressed both logistical and ethical concerns with implementing these. In the meantime, there are third-party tools that try to add some of this functionality, but they do come with wonky formatting that an official solution could probably avoid.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But even when you follow all those rules, your personal data can still be at risk, strictly because the services you rely on aren't following these rules themselves. Some websites are putting your passwords at riskResearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison discovered that a concerning number of browser extensions can access sensitive information that you enter into websites. Think passwords, credit card info, and Social Security numbers. The team behind the discovery says they weren't out looking to break a security story. Instead, they were \"messing around with login pages,\" specifically Google login pages, when they found that the sites' HTML source code could see the passwords they entered in plain text. They turned their sights onto other websites—more than 7,000, reportedly—and found that about 15% of them were also storing sensitive information in plain text. That's over 1,000 websites exposing important data.\nThat, of course, is not supposed to happen: When you enter sensitive data into a website—say, your password into Google's login page—that site shouldn't see your password at all. In short, the sites confirm your passwords through hashing algorithms—essentially, jumbling your password into a code that can be checked against the code the site stores on their end. They can then confirm you entered the right password without ever exposing the actual text. By storing things like passwords and Social Security numbers in plain text, those sites are exposing that data to anyone in the know. Importantly, that includes browser extensions. The researchers claim that 17,300 Chrome extensions—or 12.5% of the extensions available for download on Google's browser—have the permissions they need to view this sensitive plain text data. Think about the permissions you ignore when setting up a new extension, including permissions that give extensions full access to see and change what you enter on a webpage. Researchers didn't expose any extensions by name, as the situation is not necessarily the fault of the extensions, but considering the scope, it's possible some of the extensions you use can access sensitive information you enter in certain sites. Again, legitimate extensions are not the priority: Instead, it's the risk that a developer will create an extension with the intent of scraping sensitive info stored in plain text. While the researchers claim there are no extensions actively abusing this vulnerability yet, this isn't a theoretical problem. Researchers created an extension from scratch that could pull this user data, uploaded it to the Chrome Web Store, and got it approved. They took it down immediately, but proved it's possible for a hacker to get such a malicious extension on the official store. Even if the hacker didn't make the extension, they could acquire a legitimate extension with an existing user base, adjust the code to take advantage of the vulnerability, and spring the updated extension on unsuspecting users. It happens all the time, and not just on Chrome.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to protect your sensitive data from malicious browser extensionsUnfortunately, there's little you can do to prevent these sites from storing your passwords, credit cards, and Social Security numbers in plain text. The hope is, following these discoveries, websites will improve their security and kill the vulnerabilities on their end. But that's on them, not you. There are some steps you can take to mitigate the damage, however. First, make sure to limit your use of browser extensions. The fewer extensions you use, the less likely it is you'll use a malicious one. Use only extensions you fully trust, and frequently check in on updates. If the extension changes hands to a new developer, vet that new owner before continuing to use it. You could even disable your extensions when sharing sensitive information with websites. If you need to provide your Social Security number on an official web form, for example, you could disable your extensions to prevent them from reading the data.You can also limit the data you share that could stored in plain text. If given the option, use passkeys instead of passwords, as passkeys don't actually use any plain text data that hackers could steal. Similarly, use secure payment systems, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, which don't actually share your credit card information with the website you're making a payment on. The name of the game is to avoiding typing out your sensitive details unless absolutely necessary—and then, reducing the parties who can see those details. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If one of them manages to put together a compelling package of features for a reasonable price, I can decide whether or not I find that value worth the money. That's fine. What isn't fine is offering a feature for free for years, and then suddenly deciding to lock it behind a paywall. It seems YouTube didn't get that memo. Starting on Saturday, outlets like 9to5Google began reporting that YouTube Music had started to remove the ability to vie lyrics for free users. If you want a full lyrics experience, you'll need to subscribe to either YouTube Music Premium, or YouTube Premium (the latter includes Music Premium). The service hasn't cut these users off cold turkey. According to anecdotal user experiences, YouTube Music is opening lyrics access to free users for five songs per month. Once they play song number six, they'll only have access to the first two lines of each song, as the rest of the lyrics will be blurred out. These users will have to wait until the following month to view another five songs.  There appears to be no confusion about why the lyrics are blurred out, either. When you switch to the \"Lyrics\" tab on YouTube Music as a free account, a new banner appears, telling you how many views you have remaining. Beneath this, you'll see the option to \"Unlock lyrics with Premium,\" a clear message that, unless you pay up, you only get a limited number of lyrics views. This, apparently, follows a months-long period where YouTube Music tested lyrics as a Premium-only feature. \nFor what it's worth, when I tried to see what the current lyrics situation looks like on my free YouTube Music app, the service gave me two weeks of Premium for free, with no option to skip it. That's, um, nice of YouTube, but since I already have an Apple Music subscription, the only real consequence here is that I can't test these new lyrics limitations out.  Free music services that offer lyricsI don't see the strategy here. Lyrics aren't something I feel people would feel compelled to pay for specifically—but they might be annoyed enough at losing them to look elsewhere. Spotify, for example, offers a full lyrics experience for free users. It was only last week the company added offline lyric downloads for Premium users only, but, even then, that's adding a feature for the subscription tier—not taking away an existing feature from free users. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's not just Spotify, either. Other free music streaming services offers lyrics, as well, including Pandora, Amazon Music Free, and Freefy. These are largely radio services, so you may not have as much flexibility as you would have with YouTube Music free—but, hey, you at least have lyrics. Losing lyrics isn't the end of the world for free YouTube Music users, either. Just about any song's lyrics can be found on the internet. Sometimes, the lyrics show up in a Google search window without you needing to even click a link. Otherwise, sites like Genius and AZLyrics do exist. It's just a bummer YouTube feels the need to gatekeep the in-app experience.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

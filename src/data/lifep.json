If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.Finally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In its November fraud and scam advisory, Google is warning users about VPN apps and extensions that appear legitimate but are actually vectors for malware.VPNs may actually be spyware A VPN, or virtual private network, makes your internet activity much more difficult to track by routing your traffic through a different connection rather than your regular internet service provider (ISP). This allows you to hide your IP address and location, obscure your browsing data, and protect your information and devices from bad actors. According to Google, malicious VPNs (posing as real ones) are delivering infostealers, remote access trojans, and banking trojans to user devices once installed, allowing hackers to access sensitive personal data like browsing history, financial credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet information. This means that an app you rely on to keep your information private could be doing the exact opposite. Cybercriminals are capitalizing on user trust in these services, creating apps that look and feel like legitimate VPNs but are actually dangerous spyware. \nHow to ensure your VPN app is safeAs with any app or extension, only download or install a VPN from an official source like the Google Play store. While malicious programs do sometimes sneak through, it's typically safer and more reliable than sideloading through a messaging app or other unvetted site. In January 2025, Google launched a VPN verification process to help users identify trustworthy VPN apps in the Google Play store. To earn a \"verified\" badge, VPN apps have to undergo a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation and opt into independent security reviews. Badges are awarded only to VPNs that have been published for at least 90 days and reach 10,000 installs and 250 user reviews. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, this system isn't perfect either: As TechRadar reported earlier this year, a popular (free) Chrome VPN extension earned a badge and was later discovered to be spying on users. That's why you should rely on a reputable VPN service—which means you'll likely have to pay for it. Free VPNs are far more likely to a privacy nightmare, and any app that sounds too good to be true probably is. You aren't going to get unlimited traffic at no cost without sacrificing something. Finally, review VPN permissions carefully, and allow the minimum access possible for the app or extension to function. (You should do this with any app you download, and you should audit apps regularly to remove unnecessary permissions.) You can check your VPN service's support pages to find out which permissions are essential—this should not include access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or photos, for example. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It saves me a lot of money and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.The AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Websites from X to ChatGPT went offline as Cloudflare, the company they rely on for web infrastructure services, experienced a massive outage. A huge number of sites and services across the world contract Cloudflare for cybersecurity protections, as well as to route traffic through servers local to each user, all in the name of performance and reliability. Ironic, of course, given today's events.When the public experiences such a massive internet outage, speculation runs awry. What caused this? Was it a simple bug on Cloudflare's part, or something malicious? Are bad actors attacking Cloudflare, and the sites that rely on it? But, as it turns out, the reason appears to be closer to the former than the latter.Cloudflare's outage was a glitchIn a statement to Mashable, Cloudflare confirmed that the company had identified the cause of the issue, and had rolled out a fix to patch it. In addition, Cloudflare is adamant there is no reason to believe a cyberattack caused this outage. This is the full statement: \n\"Many of Cloudflare's services experienced a significant outage today beginning around 11:20 UTC. It was fully resolved at 14:30 UTC. The root cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic. The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services.To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity. We expect that some Cloudflare services will be briefly degraded as traffic naturally spikes post incident but we expect all services to return to normal in the next few hours. A detailed explanation will be posted soon on blog.cloudflare.com. Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable. We apologize to our customers and the Internet in general for letting you down today. We will learn from today's incident and improve.\" It seems the reason for the outage was a preventative measure meant to block a potential cyberattack. While that goal is obviously important, it shows how complex these systems really are: One glitch with one cybersecurity protocol spun out of control, and took down the network en masse.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        A lot of people are wrong about low testosterone. The \"low testosterone\" hashtag on TikTok features over 20,000 videos from real doctors, fake doctors, real doctors who seem like fake doctors, bodybuilders, wellness weirdoes, straight-up scammers, and, seemingly, everyone else. Some of the content is accurate, some is wildly inaccurate, some is in the middle, but the overall impression is a confusing miasma where solid medical information is given equal space with people recommending boosting your testosterone by exposing your privates to direct sunlight for 10 minutes a day.  So let's clear this up a little.What low testosterone actually isTestosterone is a hormone produced mainly in the testicles (and in smaller amounts in ovaries and adrenal glands) that helps regulate muscle growth, energy, sex drive, mood, and overall reproductive health. So it's important. Low testosterone, also known as clinical hypogonadism, is a medical syndrome defined by persistently low testosterone levels in the blood, coupled with the presence of specific, debilitating symptoms like reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, or unexplained loss of muscle mass. It's a real medical condition, most common in older men, men with obesity, and is associated with poorly managed type 2 diabetes. \nIt's difficult to determine how common low testosterone is because different studies are counting different things in different populations and the definition of \"low\" varies. Be warned: It's going to get a little technical, but there's a difference between biochemical hypogonadism and clinical hypogonadism. If you're looking at people with both low levels of testosterone in their blood and specific symptoms, estimates range from 2% of men aged 40–79, according to a European cross-sectional study published in the New England Journal of Medicine to 5.6% according to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS). If you're strictly looking at testosterone levels in blood in men over 45, with no regard to symptoms, the same MMAS study says that 38.7% have \"low testosterone,\" using MMAS-specific lab cutoffs. These are the kinds of blurry lines that let people claim \"nearly 40% of men suffer from low T!\" and be telling something like the truth, but not really.Why your doctor doesn't routinely screen your testosterone levelsWhen you get a physical, doctors generally don't check your testosterone level. This has led to an online conspiracy theory around testosterone that doctors are deliberately keeping patients from being diagnosed. The conspiracy theory goes like this: \"The medical establishment, influenced by Big Pharma and insurance companies, is keeping a miracle cure from people because: A) It's more profitable to treat other diseases. B) Society is inherently biased against men acting manly. C) Reverse vampires told them to.\"As with all conspiracy theories, the truth is much more mundane: You're not routinely screened for low testosterone because the prevalence of hypogonadism in the general population, without clear symptoms, is very low; test results are highly unreliable and prone to false positives unless done under strict conditions; and having low testosterone levels isn't even a medical problem unless you have specific, debilitating symptoms. If you do have symptoms like fatigue, low libido, erectile dysfunction, or loss of muscle mass, and you have low testosterone, it could still be because of other health issues like stress, poor sleep, diabetes, obesity, or sleep apnea. Hypogonadism is not the same thing as \"toxic masculinity.\" It doesn't cause people to \"follow random girls on social media.\" It cannot be diagnosed with \"one clue.\" It doesn't make you more likely to seek validation from others. Low testosterone doesn't make you a \"whiny bitch.\"  High testosterone doesn't make you more jealous of your wife, either. Most importantly, low testosterone is not the reason you feel run down, stressed out, or depressed—probably.That \"probably\" is really the issue, the wedge that makes \"low testosterone\" the perfect breeding ground for health misinformation. Having less energy and a lower libido are solidly on the \"normal human experience\" spectrum, but because they could be caused by low testosterone, some people are drawn to that explanation, and the idea of a quick fix for aging and/or general malaise. Others see an opportunity to make some cash. Historical precedent: snake oil and goat ballsThe discourse may be happening on TikTok and instagram, but scammy \"low testosterone\" sales pitches originate with 19th-century medicine shows and the patent medicine salesmen that followed. If you read between the lines of much online testosterone talk, the promise is to treat lack of strength, lack of energy, lack of virility, or overall lack of \"manliness\"— concerns that have been monetized for a long time. Back in the 1800s, it was literal snake oil. In 1920s, lack of virility was sometimes treated by surgical introduction of goat glands in the testicles. In the 2020s, we're taking Tongkat Ali, ginger, Jamaican Chaney Root, and literally hundreds of other \"supplements\" marketed as testosterone boosters instead.Despite testimony from satisfied customers back in the Jazz Age, goat tissue doesn't actually engraft or function when injected into the testicles, so it doesn't make men more goat-like. Herbs probably don't work either, no matter what that bodybuilder on Instagram says. A review of 32 studies of 13 different herbs meant to raise testosterone concluded that only two (Fenugreek and Ashwagandha) showed any promise, but like many studies on herbal supplements, the research is shaky: The sample sizes are too small, and test subjects didn't have a diagnosed clinical condition so the results may not apply to men who are genuinely deficient. So we have extremely scant evidence that herbs could raise your testosterone, and basically no evidence that raising your testosterone would provide a benefit anyway. When should you ask your doctor about your testosterone levels?If you actually suspect you have clinical hypogonadism, do not take herbs or listen to influencers. Talk to your doctor if you have these symptoms:Significant, unexplained decrease in libido Erectile dysfunction DepressionGynecomastia (unexplained swelling or tenderness of the breast tissue)Unexplained loss of body or facial hairLoss of muscle mass and strength (not explained by changes in your exercise routine)Infertility Other symptoms, like not enjoying bitter food, or not \"not getting a boner when you're holding hands,\" likely have other causes. If you want to dig deeper into symptoms of hypogonadism, check out the Mayo Clinic's page. How can you raise testosterone levels? If you're basically healthy, but you still think there's something to the whole \"I need more testosterone, now!\" there's good news and bad news. The good news is that it's possible to raise testosterone levels without hormone replacement or taking supplements. The bad news: There is solid scientific research to support the idea that you can raise testosterone levels by losing weight, exercise, and getting enough sleep. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

That means scammers are also busy contacting people, impersonating insurance providers in an effort to collect personal, financial, and medical information.Fraudsters especially love to impersonate representatives from Medicare, targeting older adults and others who qualify for the federal program with unexpected calls. As the Federal Trade Commission warns, scammers may have some of your personal information already and will ask you to confirm your Medicare, bank account, and/or credit card number under the guise of sending you a new Medicare card. In reality, Medicare cards are free and sent automatically, so you should never need to provide payment. Scammers may also target consumers on Marketplace, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans with a similar tactic, claiming that you may lose or be disqualified from health coverage unless you make a payment. \nIn addition to impersonating government officials, bad actors will pretend to represent a legitimate insurer, promising discounted plans (that are available only for a limited time) or enrollment assistance (for a fee). Plans that seem too good to be true probably aren't health insurance at all and may not provide the coverage promised. And you shouldn't have to pay anyone to sign up for a plan.  Note that while scammers may ramp up efforts during open enrollment, health insurance scams can happen year-round. A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) advisory warns consumers about common tactics like calls and texts in which scammers—impersonating government agencies or insurance companies—offer health screening, free gifts, or other promotional benefits in exchange for your personal information. Bad actors can pretty easily spoof phone numbers (so it looks like you're getting a call from a reputable insurance provider like Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield) as well as set up phishing websites designed to steal your credentials and financial information. Insurance scam red flagsAs always, unsolicited communication that pressures you to take action is almost always a scam. Medicare representatives will never call, email, or text you to verify information or demand payment, nor will legitimate government officials try to sell you anything or threaten you unless you pay up. If someone claims they represent an insurer and asks for money or sensitive personal information, or if they threaten you with legal action, hang up. Don't share any data, including your social security number, bank account number, or medical history with anyone—that is, unless you have contacted the Medicare office or other legitimate agency directly and first and need to verify your identity. (The number for Medicare is 1-800-MEDICARE, and you can reach a Marketplace representative through HealthCare.gov). Always verify a representative's identity using official contact information found on a .gov website, legitimate company page, or an account statement, and never send money via gift card, prepaid debit, or crytocurrency in exchange for anything. You should also ensure your credentials for your insurance accounts (like HealthCare.gov and Medicare.gov) are strong and secure, and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

When I tried to load sites like X, ChatGPT, or, ironically, Downdetector, I was met with various errors. X showed me an internal service error, while Downdetector asked me to \"Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.\" (I definitely do not have that authority.) You may experience similar errors on websites you try to load this morning, even ones you don't regularly visit. As part of this article, for example, I would google queries and click the top results to websites I had never heard of before, only to encounter similar error messages. That's because a large portion of the global internet relies on Cloudflare to operate. Cloudflare offers a host of services to companies, including web infrastructure and cybersecurity products. As such, when Cloudflare goes down, so do many of those websites—a bit of a domino effect.\nIt's not clear at this time what brought on the outage, but, as spotted by Techradar, Cloudflare had announced scheduled maintenance for some of its web servers for Nov. 18, ranging from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. UTC (7am to 10am ET), so it's possible something happened during this work to break service. The good news is, it appears that many of these sites are back up and running—at least, at this time. At 8:09 a.m. ET, Cloudflare reported it had identified the issue, and was working on a fix. At 9:42 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it rolled out the fix, and that the company believes the incident is resolved—though the official status page still says the Cloudflare Global Network is experiencing issues. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile this is indeed a big interruption to the internet, it's far from the first time this has happened. In fact, an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage broke the internet last month. With the Cloudflare outage this morning, it's an example of the risks of so many companies putting their web services needs in the same basket: If one servicer goes, so too goes a huge fraction of the web. Cloudflare will likely patch this issue sometime Tuesday, so I imagine we'll all be back to business as usual soon enough.

If you tried to follow your feeds on X, or engage with ChatGPT, you were only met with error messages. Compare those error messages to one another, however, and you'd likely notice a similar name affixed to them all: Cloudflare. Cloudflare's massive Tuesday morning outage had sweeping implications for much of the web. While it's not clear what caused the outage at this time, we do know whether the outage was responsible for a website's downtime. (When an error page says \"Cloudflare: Error,\" it's not difficult to track down the source of the problem.) As Cloudflare offers web infrastructure services to a huge number of sites, the true list of affected sites is likely massive. As an example, I wanted to convert the timezone Cloudflare uses in its status reports, UTC, to ET, and the first website I clicked on in my Google search returned an error. While there's no central repository listing each and every affected website, we can look at the sites with the largest number of user reports indicating issues this morning through Downdetector. (Disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Lifehacker.) Ironically, Downdetector itself was down this morning—it too uses Cloudflare.\nDowndetector is not a service that investigates and reports websites that are down. Instead, users can self-report issues with sites on Downdetector. As such, it can be illuminating to see which sites visitors were having issues with during the period of time Cloudflare was down. At this time, that includes the following:XCloudflareOpenAIChatGPTGrindrArchive of Our OwnAWSSpotifyLeague of LegendseClinicalWorksQuizletUberCharacter.aiCanvaClaudeVaroIndeedProcoreTruth SocialFanFictionArloDoorDashValorantRunescapeDayforceNJTransitSniffiesSquareGoogleZoomRoverCollegeBoardLetterboxd  Bet365MoneyLionDayZBetMGMYouTubeMicrosoftIKEASunoMicrosoft 365Canvas by InstructureMicrosoft TeamsAmazonGrokInstagramGeminiAgain, this list is not definitive, nor is it official.

If you download an app that's useful on your phone, there's a good chance you'll also want that app on your tablet, or even your Chromebook. Likewise, if you no longer find an app useful on one device, you likely won't want to keep it on your other devices, either.It can be annoying, however, to uninstall the app from each of your devices individually. Maybe you're using the app on your smartphone and you decide to delete it, but forget to delete it on your other devices. It might live on your tablet or Chromebook for a while before you realize you want it gone. That's annoying, but, in extreme cases, it can also be risky: Maybe you're trying to delete an app that was later discovered to be malicious, but if it still lives on your other devices, it might end up causing you harm. While there has been a way to remotely uninstall apps on other devices, it's been buried in the \"Manage apps and device\" section, and isn't all that easy to execute.The latest update to the Play Store aims to fix that problem. As spotted by Android Authority, with version 48.8, the Play Store now lets you simply uninstall apps from your other devices using your smartphone. Once you're running this version of the Play Store (as well as future versions), you can visit an app's Play Store page and look for a new \"Available on more devices\" section. Here, you'll see all of your connected Android devices, with options to either \"Uninstall\" or \"Install\" the app on those devices. There's no longer the need to dig through your settings.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis feature should make it easy to keep your Android ecosystem a bit more ordered and organized, but it's not the only improvement the Play Store is rolling out. Starting next year, Google will start penalizing apps that use too much battery power. The Play Store will either remove those apps from discoverability pages, or add an alert to the apps' Play Store pages, warning users these apps take up more battery than necessary.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Because so many of the new model's biggest features are hidden behind paywalls, it's not a bad deal, even if it's not the first time Google's done this. The deal follows similar promotions from April and August, although the most recent one ended in October. That this offer is coming so soon after the last one means Google might plan to keep rolling out these trials on a regular basis.How to claim your free year of Google AI Pro as a U.S. college studentTo get your free year of Google AI Pro, first head over to gemini.google/students and click Get Offer. You'll then need to log into your personal Google account, where you'll be prompted to verify your student status using SheerID. After that, Google says it should be a pretty straightforward signup flow, although being over a decade out of college by now, I'm not able to test it personally.Note that you will need to provide a form of payment, and that if you don't cancel the plan by the time the trail is over, your subscription will renew using your provided payment method. You also only have until January 31, 2026 to sign up for the trail.\nThe most likely error you're likely to run into is if your college isn't supported by the trial, which is handled by SheerID. Neither Google nor SheerID are being upfront about which institutions are and aren't supported, but Google says that if you run into issues, you can contact [email protected] or go to the SheerID help center.You also have to be older than 18, which means some freshman might have trouble signing up, and you cannot be on a supervised Google Account, or currently have a Google One subscription through either family sharing or a third party affiliate. Google says you can cancel an existing paid AI Pro plan to swap it for the trial, but you can't try to subscribe using the trial while applying a discount from buying a Pixel phone (which would theoretically apply after the free period ends).There's also some conflicting communication online. The current offer terms state you must \"be a resident of the United States,\" although the current help page for the trial still refers to previous offers, which were offered to other regions as well. I've reached out to Google for clarification, but for now, I would assume the offer only applies to those in the U.S. and expires on January 31, given the information in the Gemini 3 Pro press release.I've also reached out to Google about whether students who've already claimed the free year-long trial can extend their offer time by signing up for the new one, as while the help page mentions that \"new and existing Google one members,\" are eligible, it's unclear whether those already on a free trial count as proper subscribers. I'd guess the answer is probably no, but I'll let you know if Google tells me otherwise.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat you get with your free year of Google AI ProYour free year of Google AI Pro comes with a free year of Google One Premium, too, which means it's got some benefits for you even if you're skeptical about AI.For AI users, Google AI Pro offers the following:Higher usage limits for deep research and recent models like Gemini 3 ProGemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3 Pro in AI ModeVideo generation with Veo 3.1 Fast and higher access to Google Flow and image-to-video generation in Veo 3.More remix generations and Veo 3 photo-to-video generations in Google photos1,000 monthly AI creditsIncreased NotebookLM accessHigher limits in coding tools including Jules, Gemini Code Assist, Gemini CLIGoogle Home Premium with Gemini features and 30 days of event historyFor everyone else, you'll still get 2TB of free cloud storage through Google One, which should be handy for all those assignments. Normally, when signing up for a Google One Premium Plan, you also have the option to bundle a YouTube Premium individual plan for a 14% discount, although it's unclear to me whether that's included in the trial, so I've also reached out to Google for clarity on this.And that's it! Personally, I wouldn't see myself using most of those AI features, but the 2TB of cloud storage is good enough that it's probably worth signing up for the trial just for that. Just remember to either be ready to pay the $20/month price once your year is up, or cancel before then.

Popular sites like X and ChatGPT were unresponsive, returning error messages rather than their usual homepages. The culprit? A massive Cloudflare outage.The upside is that the outage appears to be ending. Cloudflare says it has identified the problem and issued a fix, so affected websites should be coming back online this morning. But that doesn't change the fact that so many websites went dark today, all because one company experienced unexplained downtime. How is it that a Cloudflare outage can seemingly break the internet? What is Cloudflare?Cloudflare offers a number of products for sites and services with the goals of improving traffic performance and reliability, as well as cybersecurity. A company like Cloudflare spreads its network out throughout the globe, so that when users try to visit a website, the server they ping is the one closest to them. Rather than all users attempting to visit your server at once, they go through their Cloudflare server local. \nThis serves two main purposes: First, it limits the demand on your site. If all users were trying to ping your server at once, it puts a strain on your network, and could either slow things down or shut them down completely. Routing users to the Cloudflare server closest to them spreads out the demand, and reduces the risk of interruption. In addition, users are less likely to experience delays in physical distance to your network: If you're based in Japan, and your user is based in New York, it's going to take them longer to reach your server than it would a user from South Korea. However, if that New York user instead connects to a Cloudflare server closest to them, they can access your data much more quickly. Why does Cloudflare affect so many websites?Cloudflare's goal is to improve the experience for users around the world to visit international websites—so why does it seem like half the internet went dark when Cloudflare experienced an outage?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reason is because so many websites use Cloudflares services. According to Backlinko, over 24 million websites actively rely on Cloudflare in some capacity. That includes over 4,300 of the 10,000 \"most popular\" websites around the world. The U.S. alone has nearly 2,470,000 million websites relying on Cloudflare, while the UK has almost 780,000. Many other countries, like Brazil, Germany, Russia, Australia, Canada, China, India, and France, each have hundreds of thousands of websites running on Cloudflare.There are over one billion websites out there in the world, which means a total Cloudflare outage would account for roughly 2% of global websites' connectivity issues. However, if Backlinko's stats are correct, a huge percentage of popular websites rely on Cloudflare. Sure, the vast majority of websites may remain unaffected by this outage, but nearly half of the sites people most often visit have problems here. If you primarily visit U.S. websites, that number may be even higher. It's a similar reason why an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage takes down so many websites. AWS provides cloud computing services for so many companies and websites, that when issues pop-up, you experience problems with your favorite websites. It poses a logistical question for how the global internet currently works: Yes, it's great that services like Cloudflare make it possible to reliably access international websites as if they were within your region—but if too much of the internet leans on it, is it really all that reliable?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It's not the first time the company has experimented with giving the average Joe the ability to send AI robocalls, but it is much more robust than previous outings.Rolling out today, the feature will show up while you're browsing for certain products on Search, so long as you add a \"near me\" to the end of your query. If the product is supported, you'll see a \"Let Google Call\" button, which is where the fun begins.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nTap \"Get started,\" and the AI will ask you a few clarifying questions and have you fill in your email (or phone number) and address information. After that, it'll call local businesses on your behalf and ask for product availability and pricing before sending you an email or text with information broken down by store.\nAt a press event, I got to experience a live demo of what these robocalls sound like from the seller's perspective. If you're worried about getting blacklisted for pestering your local stores with too many calls, don't be. The robocall does not link itself to you at all, and instead says it's an AI calling on behalf of Google and that it won't use the information on the call for training purposes (phew). It'll then ask a few questions before hanging up and moving on. In the demo, the Google employee acting the part of store clerk was also able to interrupt the call and refer to previous statements for context without issue, although she also spoke clearly and slowly—this might not pan out as well in the real world.For what it's worth, I did think the call sounded a little disconcertingly close to a human voice for me, so I could see some employees getting confused if they miss the first line clarifying it's coming from an AI. A Google spokesperson at the press event also addressed what might happen if your robocall gets picked up by an automatic answering system, saying \"they'll figure it out\" before suggesting that, in a worst case scenario, the answering system would probably forward the call to a human.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nUnfortunately, Google didn't give any indication of how long it might take for you to get your text or email with results from your calls. Examples that Google demonstrated showed that the robot can do more than simply report inventory and price; it can also make notes about special deals or bundles an employee might mention.This feature is currently limited to \"categories like toys, health and beauty, and electronics\" for now, so don't expect to be able to use it for everything yet. It also seems to have a somewhat slow rollout—either I didn't know what to search, or I don't have the feature yet, because I couldn't get it to pop up for me while I was writing this article.If you're anything like me, your biggest concern about this feature is that you might annoy the workers at whatever stores you're calling. Google says it will try to limit multiple calls asking for the same info (such as from multiple customers who want to know the same thing) and that it will avoid calling late at night or early in the morning. Businesses are also able to opt out of getting AI calls by saying something like \"please stop calling my business\" during the call, or by updating their business profile under More > Business Profile settings > Advanced settings > Google automated calls and text messages.Google's AI robocalls also are only available in the U.S. and only in English, so business owners abroad can breathe a sigh of relief. Because of state laws, AI robocalls also can't be placed in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, and Nebraska.I'll admit that I have opted not to call a business because of social anxiety before, although I'm not sure having a robot bother someone for me would make me feel any better.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Sure, it's not locked down to the extent iOS and iPadOS are, but compared to Linux and even Windows, macOS really doesn't let you change the look and feel very much.But that isn't to say there's no room to tweak the operating system to make it the way you like—if you know where to look. Here are a few third-party tools that let you make macOS your own.Use a custom cursorIt's pretty easy to change how the mouse pointer looks on Windows and Linux—you just need to dig around in the settings. On macOS, you can only change the size of the pointer.\nUnless, that is, you install the free and open source Mousecape. This application lets you create a cursor, then use it in place of the default system ones. You can also install cursors made by others. There's no centralized collection of cursors for this, unfortunately, but I found a fun hand on Github, some Wii cursors, and a decent collection on DeviantArt. You could also try your hand at creating your own set.Note that Tahoe users will have to download an updated fork in order to use Mousecape—the main build doesn't work at the moment. You'll need to install a pre-release download as of this writing.Use any website as your wallpaper\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nSome great wallpapers, including dynamic ones, are included with macOS. There's also the option to use your own photos. But what macOS doesn't offer are custom, animated wallpapers.Enter Plash. This free application lets you turn any website into a macOS wallpaper, which opens up all kinds of interactive possibilities. A few sites included let you look out a random stranger's window, see real-time weather data, or take in some animated pixel art, but you can use any website you can think of. It's a lot of fun to play around with.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe macOS menu bar is a bit of a mess. Windows makes it relatively easy to hide icons by dragging them to a secondary area. Apple hasn't offered anything like this until Tahoe, which added a way to disable any icon in the settings. The problem: it's all or nothing. Hide an icon in the settings and there's no quick way to access it other than going back into the settings and turning it back on.For that, you'll need a third party app. I personally recommend Ice, which is the best free app for cleaning up your menu bar. My coworker Pranay recommends Barbee, another great option. Both make it easy to hide menu bar icons in a secondary bar accessible by hitting an icon, similar to how it works on Windows. Every Mac user should install some sort of tool like this.Change your folder icons\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThis one isn't unofficial, exactly, but it's so buried it might as well be. You can change the icon for any folder, document, or even application by right-clicking it, clicking \"Get Info\", then dragging an image to the icon in the window that opens. Weird, right? But it works, meaning you can customize folders to look however you want. I talked about this in an article with more details.This gets really fun if you install Fancy Folders, a free application seen in the image above which allows you to create folder icons in the color of your choice, complete with either the text or icon of your choice. It's a lot of fun to play with, and can be very useful for visually keeping things organized.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've written before about other ways to mold Pomodoro to match what you need, but today's idea, Pomodoro 2.0, is one of the easiest and most effective adaptations. What do I mean by \"Pomodoro 2.0?\"First, a refresher on what the Pomodoro technique even is. When you're using this technique to focus and be productive, you set an alarm for 25 minutes, work for that time, then take a five-minute break. You complete that cycle four times, then give yourself a longer break at the end, up to half an hour, before starting again. That's it. It works because you spend those relatively short bursts concentrating on the task at hand, knowing a reprieve is coming. Since they're not too long, it doesn't feel insurmountable. It also works because those breaks play an important role. Taking periodic breaks can make you more productive, both because they give your brain a rest and because they stop you from toiling to the point that your output gets shoddy.\nI saw the idea of \"Pomodoro 2.0\" mentioned on a forum a while back and started Googling. What I found impressed me—it addresses one of the main critiques I have of the original, which is that 25 minutes isn't always enough time to get into a state of deep work, or work that is uninterrupted, purely focused, and effortless enough that time seems to be flowing by.Over at Beyond Productivity, Dr. Christian Poensgen recommends starting the Pomodoro session with a 30-minute work block, then adding more time to it after the break, tacking on between 15 or 60 minutes. I recommend doing this incrementally, adding 15 every time, so you work for 30, then 45, then 60, and finally 75 minutes before your big break. Adding too much too soon—or working in too-large chunks all the way through—defeats one of the main purposes of the technique, which is to not get overwhelmed, so taking it slower and easier while still adding on time is the best bet.If you're not sure how much time to add on, familiarize yourself with the concept of flowtime. Also known as \"flowmodoro,\" the idea here is that you should track how long you can work on a given task before you feel drained, track how long your breaks need to be to make you feel reenergized, and start creating custom, Pomodoro-esque work and rest blocks for every kind of task you do in a given day. It takes a bit of data collection and planning, but it can help you master the general technique while still prioritizing deep work and breaks.Why use Pomodoro 2.0?The Pomodoro technique shines (and has been so popular for so long) because it helps you ease into your work, motivated by the small work sprints and promise of rewards. It's absolutely true that you need to take breaks to keep your productivity up, so that part should never be altered or skipped, but sometimes, 25-minute grind sessions just aren't enough and five minutes to reset isn't, either. Getting into a state of deep work takes time. Repeatedly stopping yourself before you hit that point is counter-productive. Giving yourself more time to work on harder, more complex tasks is critical in some instances, just like taking breaks. Adding time to the work blocks in increments helps you settle in and get more done without overwhelming yourself. You should consider this alteration if you have a major project that demands a lot of resources or energy, letting yourself build up to the hard parts as you add minutes to your timer. If you're trying this out and not getting the results you want, you can shake it up another way, too. Remember the idea of \"eating the frog,\" or tackling your biggest to-do list item first thing in the morning? Consider eating the frog in Pomodoro 2.0, starting with your 75-minute block and working backward to 60, 45, and 30. Remember, none of these rules are hard and fast; you can make changes that match your needs and personal preferences. If you're someone who doesn't get overwhelmed and has the ability to jump in on long-term work, this structure could suit you, as the promise of shorter and shorter work sessions can feel like a motivator of its own. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Laugh all you want—we exist.I enjoy having a polished operating system on my computer and an endlessly hackable operating system on my phone, and the combination of Mac and Android gave me all of that. I only stopped using Android alongside my Mac a couple years ago, mostly because an iPhone SE was cheaper than most mid-range Android options at the time.When I think about switching back, though, I realize how much I'll miss the integrations. Using a Mac and an iPhone gives you access to all kinds of tricks. Among the ones I use the most are the shared notifications, the syncing clipboard, and the easy ways to sync files. There's also the ability to control your iPhone from your Mac. Android users can't do any of this on a Mac.\nThat's where AirSync comes in. The open source application, built by Sri Lanka based developer Sameera Sandakelum, integrates Android devices with macOS in all kinds of ways. Android notifications show up on your Mac. You can sync your clipboard. It's also easy to send files from Android to the Downloads folder on your Mac, or vice versa. And with a little bit of setup, you can even take control of your Android device from the comfort of your Mac.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nGetting started is straightforward. You need to download the app for Android and macOS and install them. You will be prompted on both devices to enable certain permissions, after which you can connect your devices to each other by scanning a QR code. (It's worth noting that you can only connect devices that are on the same wifi network.)After that, you should start seeing Android notifications on your Mac—they'll show up in the native Mac notifications, or you can review existing ones in the app itself. You can even trigger buttons, allowing you to do things like respond to text messages from the notifications on your Mac. Items copied on your clipboard on one device will sync to the other. And you will see controls for the media currently playing on your Mac on the lock screen of your Android device.It has lot of nice touches, and you can go a bit further by paying for AirSync+, which costs either $2.49/month or $50 one time. This paid version of the application lets you take control of your Android device, similar to iPhone Mirroring. I tried this feature out and enjoyed it, though you can set this up yourself using Scrcpy for free.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nOther features in the paid version include controlling your Android's music from your Mac, opening websites open on one device from another, and custom app icons.Even without these paid features, though, Airsync makes it a little bit easier to be a Mac/Android person. Not missing notifications, easier file sharing, and clipboard syncing are all big quality of life improvements, so check this app out if you're tired of macOS and Android not playing nicely together.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you’re always sore (or, worse, injured) after the first big storm of the season, read these tips on how to make shoveling easier on your body.Recognize what you’re asking your body to doLook, just because shoveling is a common chore doesn’t mean it’s one that everyone’s body is automatically ready for. Be honest about whether you’re trained for this. You wouldn’t ask “how can I run a marathon without my legs being sore the next day?” if you haven’t done any running at all in the past year. Jumping into something you’re not ready for is going to suck.If you know you’ll be shoveling a lot, plan ahead. Deadlifts in the gym will help you build the strength you need in your back, core, and legs, for example. If you’re not up for that, any full body fitness regime will leave you better prepared than doing nothing. \nAnd while we’re mostly talking about sore muscles and aching joints, it’s important to recognize whether your cardiovascular system is up to the task. If you aren’t used to exercising, and if you are older or have a heart condition, you may want to check with your doctor about whether shoveling poses a risk to your heart.Shovel early and oftenIf I could give the world only one snow-shoveling hack, it is this: Shovel when there is only a small amount of snow, even if you know there’s more coming. It’s far, far easier on your body to shovel three inches of snow four times over the course of the day, than to tackle 12 inches of snow all at once. If you missed your opportunity, you can still shovel in layers. Take a slice off the top, then a slice that goes deeper, and so on. Each shovelful will be much lighter and easier to deal with, even though you are taking more shovelfuls in total.Push instead of liftWe tend to envision shoveling as a repetitive bend-and-lift movement, but don’t forget that you can also use your shovel as a snowplow to push the snow in front of you. You can even buy shovels that are meant to be used this way, so consider an upgrade. Pushing the snow works best when it’s in a thin layer, so this works well with the advice to shovel when there’s only a small amount on the ground. But even if you have deep snow, pushing can save you some effort. Push until you have a pile, and then slice off the pile in layers.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep your back straightYou’ve heard the advice to lift heavy boxes “with your legs, not your back.” What this really means is that your back is best protected from injury when you can keep it straight. If your back rounds as it gets tired, take a break, or find a technique that allows you to keep your back straight even while it’s tired. For example, it’s most efficient to shovel in a deadlift-like motion: Your back is more or less straight, and you’re hingeing from your hips like a drinky bird. This does require a lot of work from your lower back muscles, so you are technically lifting “with your back,” but it’s safe as long as your back muscles are strong enough to keep your torso straight and stable. As your back muscles get tired, you may find it easier to keep your back straight if you keep it more upright. This is where a squat motion comes in—the proverbial lifting “with your legs.” Choke up on the shovel so the weight is as close to your body as possible, and bend your knees more so that you don’t have to bend as much from the hips.Warm up, take breaks, and go easy on yourselfDon’t kid yourself: This is a workout. And as with any workout, the first 10 to 15 minutes will feel the hardest. So keep the work light at first—take smaller shovelfuls, for example. Don’t forget to take breaks, either. You’re not cheating if you stop for a few minutes to let your body rest before getting back into it.Switching techniques (as above) and positions can help to distribute the strain across your body rather than just hammering the same muscles over and over. Do half your shoveling with the shovel on your right side, and half with the shovel to your left. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Take a Message is a recently introduced feature for the Phone app that activates when the recipient is not available to answer (or declines the incoming call). The caller hears the following: “The person you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” If you, as the recipient, tap the Take a message notification on your device, you can see a transcript of the audio in real time and hit Answer if you want to pick up. (Take a Message will also detect spam calls and mark them with a warning.)A few users have reported that Take a Message has activated and allowed the caller to hear the recipient's background audio as they are leaving a message. It's important to note that this is not a widespread issue, and most of the reports come from people with older Pixel devices that no longer get OS updates. According to 9to5Google, Google is investigating the reports. \nAgain, while this doesn't seem to be a bug affecting most Pixel users, you can disable Take a Message if you are concerned about privacy, especially with unknown callers. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to disable Take a Message on your PixelOpen the Phone app on your device and tap the icon in the top-left corner to open Settings.

According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to subscribe to Full Self-Driving instead.Before, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).Now, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.Which features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.At any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

JustTheBrowser is a free and open source tool from developer and tech blogger Corbin Davenport that removes AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Basically, you can run this once and never think about these features again.To get started, head to the JustTheBrowser homepage. There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.Either way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing.

Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.It's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing. The issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The bot generates a playlist for you based on your request.\n                                            These playlists take your entire Spotify listening history into account, as well.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Last month, Spotify announced \"Prompted Playlist,\" a new feature the company claimed let users \"steer the algorithm.\" This was a bold—if not vague—claim, to be sure, but it was backed by everyone's favorite tech trend of the last three years: AI. The pitch was that Spotify would let subscribers use the company's AI models to better control their listening experience, so long as they lived in the country of New Zealand. That's a very small slice of Spotify's very large user base. Luckily for those of us in the United States and Canada, Prompted Playlist is expanding to our side of North America. Spotify announced the move today, Jan. 21: Now, Premium subscribers in any of these three countries can access the feature, if they want to hand over the playlist reigns to Spotify's machine learning models.Prompted Playlist is Spotify's AI-powered tool that lets you use natural language to create custom playlists. The idea is, rather than look for songs to add to a playlist, you tell Spotify's AI what you're in the mood to listen to, and it adds songs automatically for you. That can include genres and existing songs, but also ideas, deeper descriptions, and, for lack of a better word, vibes. \nTo understand what I mean, here are some of the suggested prompts Spotify suggests you try: \"Make me a playlist of songs I’ve saved to my Library (playlists or Liked Songs) that I either haven’t played yet or have only listened to once. The goal is to round up those songs I found, saved, and then totally forgot to revisit. Give me a chance to finally hear what I’ve been missing.\"\"What are the first tracks I ever listened to on Spotify? Order them by the very first track I ever streamed - with date and time - and keep going.\"\"Knowing what I listen to today, make me a playlist of songs from 2016 that match my current taste, mixing the biggest tracks from that year with songs that feel timeless now.\"\"Make me a playlist to help me learn Spanish, with clear vocals and easy-to-follow lyrics. Mix popular Spanish-language songs with slower tracks that make it easier to catch the words, and include music that reflects different Spanish-speaking cultures to keep it engaging.\"Spotify says that Prompted Playlist takes your existing listening history into account as well. While you and a friend might give Spotify's AI the same prompt, in theory, you should each receive different playlists, since the AI will make adjustments based on the music you like and don't like. You also don't have to wonder why the AI put a specific song in the playlist: Each track starts with a \"quick one-liner\" that explains why Spotify chose it in the first place. I could see that being either insightful, or extremely annoying.The thing is, Spotify has rolled out a feature like this before, appropriately dubbed \"AI Playlist.\" Lifehacker's David Nield covered it in September of 2024, and catching up on that feature, it sounds pretty similar to Prompted Playlist. AI Playlist isn't actually going away now that Prompted Playlist is here: Spotify tells me that these are two separate features, and that the major differences are that Prompted Playlist factors in your entire Spotify listening history, going back to your first song, as well as real-time information about \"trends, charts, culture, and history\" in the industry today. You can also schedule playlists if you like, so the mix refreshes every day or week, something you can't do with AI Playlist.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFrom my seat, it also seems like Prompted Playlist is designed to handle more complex prompts, as well. While the company advertised AI Playlist as a way to build playlists from prompts like \"upbeat pop music for my road trip,\" the company's suggested Prompted Playlist prompts are much more intricate, and include multiple levels of instruction for the AI. Perhaps part of that is the result of improvements in the technology over the past year and half.  How to try Spotify's Prompted PlaylistPrompted Playlist is launching as a Premium-only feature, so if you don't pay for Spotify, you unfortunately can't access it. If you do have a Premium account, you'll need to head to Spotify, tap \"Create,\" then choose \"Prompted Playlist.\"As explained above, from here, you can describe what kind of playlist you want the tool to make. From here, you'll be able to set how often it refreshes (if it refreshes at all). If you're not happy with the results, you can choose \"Edit Prompt\" to adjust it. You can share the playlist with friends, but know that Spotify will adjust the playlist to match their listening histories instead. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Mail and AOL Mail, are not responding.\n                                            Downdetector shows almost 9,000 user reports as of 9:50 a.m. ET.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Your eyes don't deceive you: You did just read a headline in the year of our lord 2026 about Yahoo! Despite losing out to other search engine and email companies like Google, Yahoo! is very much still a thing. In fact, one statistic claims Yahoo! Mail still has 225 million daily active users to this day. That's a ways off from Gmail's 1.8 billion daily active users, but way better than AOL's eight million users. (Yes, AOL is still a thing, and is actually a part of Yahoo!—at least until its sale to Bending Spoons goes through).But I'm not here to talk about Yahoo! and AOL's marketshare. Instead, I'm here to sound the alarms to the millions of people that use Yahoo!, and, by extension, AOL: The services were down this morning. If you tried to search the web for something on Yahoo!, or check your Yahoo! Mail, or even your AOL Mail, you'd find the following error message: \"Edge: Too Many Requests.\" I first spotted the outage via Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which had tens of thousands of user reports, before falling off by 10:30 a.m. ET. Since then, the sites are back online.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's no official reason for the outage from Yahoo! as of this article, but, like most of these outages, the company resolved the issues fairly quickly. Last week, X had an outage, and it came back online before long. Of course, that outage was overshadowed by the massive Verizon outage, which Verizon claimed was simply a \"software issue.\" There's a big difference between a series of web sites going down and a nationwide cell network, however, so it's not surprising Yahoo! and AOL alike were both back online this morning. The millions of users who rely on these services now have them back, while the rest of us can forget about them all over again.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I love stock Android, and I'm always running the latest Android beta, making Pixel basically my only choice. But there are times when I get jealous looking at all the extra tools that Samsung provides on its Galaxy phones, Edge Panel being the big one. With Edge Panel, you can swipe in from the edge of your phone and a hidden drawer reveals itself, filled with apps, system actions, and shortcuts. Given how barebones Pixel Launcher is, I've always wanted something like this. Then I found the Panels app by Fossor Coding (not to be confused with the ill-fated wallpaper app by MKBHD).In some ways, Panels is even better than Edge Panels on Samsung. It lets you use custom icon packs, there's a quick search shortcut, and you can even open floating widgets. Plus, because it's customizable, you can move the trigger point to the bottom edge of your phone instead of the side (incredibly handy for large phones), and you can add multiple columns (up to a ridiculous seven column layout). And while you can pay for Panels, all of that basic functionality is included for free.How to customize the Panels app for AndroidFirst, install the app and give it permission to display over other apps; this makes sure that the Panels launcher can work when you're using any app.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNext, tap on the View button and customize the panel. The free version limits you to 3 columns and 9 rows, which seems like plenty to me. You can upgrade to the full version to remove this limit (which is quite cheap, at just $1.50). From the Trigger section, you can customize the trigger area. If you have a larger phone, I highly recommend bringing down the trigger area towards the bottom of the screen.Now, let's customize the Panels launcher itself. Swipe in from your trigger area and hold for a second to bring up the sidebar panel. By default, you'll see some apps here already. Tap and hold on an empty area to start adding more apps.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nYou can choose to add any of the following items:Applications: Choose any installed app. Add your most frequently used apps here.Shortcuts: Launch actions from inside any supported apps. For example, you can create a shortcut for adding a new task in TickTick, or messaging someone on WhatsApp.App pair: Create shortcuts for launching two apps side-by-side, made even more useful after Android 16's latest 90:10 split screen update.Accessibility: Add shortcuts for system-level options like Home, Back, Notifications, Screenshot, and more.System preferences: Quick access to frequently used settings like media volume, cellular data, airplane mode, Wi-Fi, and a lot more.Website: You can add any website as a quick shortcut here.Floating widget: This is a hidden gem. You can add widgets that open in a floating window above everything else. You can trigger widgets for news, weather, or sports updates. They can hover over everything else for a few seconds, before you dismiss them out of the way.Folder: If you have too many quick app options, organize them in folders instead.Contact: Add any contact here as an icon. Press and hold to quickly call, message, or email them.Quick Search: Another useful hack. The Quick Search panel brings up a fast search for all installed apps.Go over each option and choose what you'd like to add to your sidebar launcher. Me, I'm a simple man, so my focus is mostly on my most frequently used apps, shortcuts for common actions, and quick access to some system level functionality.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOne swipe gesture: Lastly, here's a pro tip. While you can open apps in Panels by swiping, lifting your thumb, and selecting, you can also do it without taking your thumb off the screen.Once you swipe in from the edge and the Panels sidebar opens up, don't let go. You can keep moving your thumb to highlight any app or shortcut (the icon that's in focus will get bigger). Then simply let go over your selection to launch it. Overall, Panels is a pretty robust app. Once you have your personalized setup, you can launch apps, shortcuts, or widgets, with just a swipe, no matter which app you're using.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I’ll log the foods I eat, the exercise I do, but drinks just happen. Did I have one glass of water or two with lunch? Hell if I know. Not to mention that your hydration depends on all the H2O you take in, not just the glasses of plain water. You can hydrate with soup, with Diet Coke, or with slices of watermelon. Most hydration apps forget this, but even if they don’t, that just makes logging even more complicated.That’s why I was intrigued by the P Water app for iPhone and Apple Watch. It tracks exactly what you’d expect from the name. I’ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I'm a fan. I tap a button on my Apple Watch when I’m heading to the bathroom, and between pit stops, I can drink whatever I want without measuring or logging any of it. If it’s been a few hours since my last bathroom trip, the app will prompt me to drink water.This approach means that I get full credit for the water in my soup and Diet Coke, because it’s still hydrating me, and my internal hydration level is still triggering my bathroom trips. I spend a total of about 30 seconds each day thinking about the app, and I measure nothing. This is ideal for me.\nWhy it makes sense to track urination rather than water intakeThe developers of P Water were not the first to think of tracking water output rather than input. You may have noted this approach is sometimes used in medical settings, and as a new parent I remember being asked how many wet diapers my newborn was producing each day. P Water cites research showing that counting up the number of times you urinate per day can give a reasonably good estimate of how hydrated you are. For example, this study on healthy young men concludes that “[Void frequency] is a reliable index of 24-[hour] hydration status” so long as bathroom visits come at a consistent “urgency”—in other words, if you sometimes go when you don’t really have to, but sometimes hold it a long time, your pee count will be less reliable as a hydration indicator. That much is pretty obvious. Tracking output rather than input accounts for not just different sources of water in your diet, but also different hydration needs. For example, the “eight glasses of water a day” rule was never a particularly good one, especially when you consider that people come in different sizes and may have different activity levels. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, if you have a need to monitor your exact hydration, an app like P Water won’t necessarily do everything you need it to do. Medical providers often ask for specific amounts when they have people do what they call a “voiding diary.” But for a general sense of whether you’re hydrating enough that you’re peeing a normal amount, P Water seems to be a convenient tool. How to use the P Water app (with or without an Apple Watch)While it’s convenient to use P Water on an Apple Watch, it also works as a regular iPhone app. The full app has some convenient actions, like having a “log a pee” option when you long-press the home screen icon or when you swipe down to see Siri suggestions.I only used the app’s most basic features—logging bathroom visits, basically—but there’s more in the settings. You can enter notes for each pee, or even use a “stealth mode” that removes the word “pee” entirely. (On the other hand, you can also lean in and ask it to use the word “piss.”) While the core functions are mostly free, some of these bonuses, like stealth mode, require a subscription ($4.99/month or $39.99/year). \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As shiny and new as your computer was when you first bought it, eventually, developers will drop support for it. There's no telling when exactly, but at some point, you'll open an app to find a message that reads something like: \"This device does not support the latest version of this app. Please update your hardware.\"That goes for Macs, as well. You might forget that fact, since Apple's computers tend to stick around for a long time. But inevitably, the shadow of end-of-life policies comes for them, too. If you're still rocking an older Mac, I have some bad news, specifically if you use Chrome: Google is officially planning its last supported version of the browser.   Google Chrome is dropping support for macOS Monterey Google quietly announced the news in a post on the Chrome Platform Status site. The company confirmed that Chrome 150 will be the last version of the browser to support macOS 12, otherwise known as macOS Monterey. Once Google eventually releases Chrome 151, users on macOS 12 will not be able to install it, and will forever be stuck on Chrome 150. Google hasn't said when Chrome 150 will actually drop (we're currently on Chrome 143), but MacRumors estimates it'll be sometime in mid-2026, based on past releases.\nBefore you panic, know there are a couple caveats here. First, Chrome will not stop working on macOS 12 once version 151 drops. You'll still be able to use Chrome as you always have. In fact, you might not even notice the difference, minus any new features and changes that Google rolls out in future software versions. You will see an alert that your browser is out of date, but it'll still get you to YouTube, Gmail, and Lifehacker.This version of macOS is also fairly outdated. Google isn't just picking last year's macOS version, or the one before that. We're currently on macOS 26, which for these purposes, could be read as macOS 16. It's the fourth version of macOS since Monterey, meaning unless you know your Mac is running macOS 12, there's a good chance you're running something that Chrome still supports. If you aren't sure, click the Apple in the top-left corner, then choose \"About This Mac.\" Here, you'll find the macOS version next to \"macOS.\"Security concerns with using Chrome on macOS 12Let's say your Mac is running macOS 12. If so, you really should stop using Chrome once version 151 drops. That's because you'll no longer receive Google's latest security updates for the browser, which puts your machine (and its data) at risk. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOnce Chrome 150 drops, bad actors will look for security vulnerabilities in the code to exploit. Google will do the same, and will patch any it or any third-party researchers find. Once 151 comes out, it'll include those patches, but Chrome 150 users will be left behind. The risk only grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered, and new versions of Chrome come out. As such, you have a couple of options if you're running macOS 12. The first is to update your OS, if you have that choice. If your Mac does support macOS 13 or newer, updating will open you up to new versions of Chrome. Of course, perhaps the reason you're running macOS 12 is because you cannot update. While that largely affects Macs that are at least 10 years old, there are still plenty of these machines out there. There are alternative ways to update your older Mac, even if Apple won't let you, such as with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, but that might be too technical a route for some. The other option here is to stop using Chrome, and switch to a browser that does support macOS 12. Firefox, for example, supports macOS 10.15 or later, and Microsoft Edge fully supports macOS 12 and later. (Safari itself hasn't been updated on macOS 12 since July 2024.) It isn't fun watching your tech grow old, but you don't need to chuck your Mac just because Chrome will end support this year—even if the newest ones are really good. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Personally, I'd rather risk frostbite over any treadmill run that lasts longer than 20 minutes. But is there a point where winter runs cross over from difficult to dangerous? There is no clear cut-offMost experts suggest that the danger zone begins around -18°F (-28° Celcius), particularly when factoring in wind chill. At these extreme temperatures, the risk of frostbite increases dramatically, and breathing frigid air can become uncomfortable or even harmful to your lungs and airways.But beyond the raw temperature, certain conditions should prompt you to choose the treadmill over the trail. Wind chill matters significantly more than the actual temperature—a 20°F day with 25 mph winds feels like -4°F and carries similar risks. Precipitation combined with cold is particularly dangerous, as wet clothing rapidly accelerates heat loss.\nIcy conditions create obvious fall risks, and a twisted ankle or other injury becomes far more serious when you're miles from home in subzero temperatures. If the footing is treacherous with ice or you're unable to adequately protect your extremities with the gear you have available, it's wise to skip the outdoor run. Trust your instincts: If the cold feels genuinely painful within the first few minutes rather than just uncomfortable, that's your body sending a clear message.Again, this threshold isn't absolute. Your personal cold tolerance, experience level, the gear you own, and specific weather conditions all play a role. I know I've managed runs in 10°F, mostly because it was plenty sunny, with no wind, and I was expertly bundled up. Here are some of things to do if you’re a brave soul heading out to run in the freezing cold.If you do venture out in very cold weather, preparation is everything. Dress in layers using moisture-wicking base layers, insulating middle layers, and windproof outer shells. Protect your extremities carefully with gloves or mittens, a hat or headband, and warm socks. A neck gaiter is a must-have to pull up over your nose and mouth to help warm the air before it reaches the lungs.Start your run into the wind so you'll have it at your back when you're sweaty and more vulnerable to heat loss on the return trip. Keep your runs shorter and stay close to home or in areas with bailout options. Let someone know your route and expected return time. It also helps to physically modify your route to accommodate layers. Plan a run where you can shed extra layers after the first mile and then pick them up on your way back.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPay attention to your body throughout the run. Any numbness, excessive pain, confusion, or severe shivering means it's time to get indoors immediately. Remember that you can always cut a run short—there's no shame in prioritizing your safety over a workout.Another tip, from plenty of personal experience: Be extra aware of mouth-breathing while running in cold, dry air. I recommend running with cough drops in order to help you practice breathing through your nose.The bottom lineI always tell myself that if something feels off after my first mile, I’m allowed to turn around and walk home. Grant yourself extra leniency in extreme weather conditions. If you really can’t bear missing any miles, consider a hybrid plan of running half of your route outdoors and half on a treadmill.You can run outside at quite chilly temperatures before you seriously risk frostbite or any other cold-weather consequences. For most runners, the practical limit for safe outdoor running falls somewhere between 0 and -20°F. As long as you’re prepared with protective gear, you can listen to your body to acclimate to cold temperatures as best as you personally can. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This is a real risk for a lot of people, especially if you are sedentary and have certain health conditions. Here's a breakdown of what’s so dangerous about shoveling, and who's most at risk. Snow shoveling is hard exerciseThe connection between shoveling and cardiac events is real: The American Heart Association cites several studies that found higher rates of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths after snowstorms. Shoveling is hard work, and it can cause your blood pressure and heart rate to rise far higher than levels that are considered safe for sedentary people with heart conditions. Cold temperatures also seem to make chest pain more likely, possibly because your arteries can constrict in the cold.Who should check with a doctor before shoveling?You may have heard the advice to check with a doctor before beginning an exercise program. I have more information on that here: Most people don’t need to check with a doctor, but that depends on your medical history and on whether you intend to do intense exercise. Since snow shoveling is intense exercise, it’s worth taking a look at those guidelines. If you have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or kidney disease, and are currently not exercising intensely, you should check with a doctor before you start. That’s true whether the intense exercise you want to do is running, Crossfit, or shoveling six inches of snow from your driveway. Pushing a snowblower counts, tooOne surprising thing: The cautions around shoveling snow also apply to using a snowblower. Snowblowing turns out to also be serious exercise, even if, in theory, it should be easier because a machine is doing part of the work. How to reduce your risk of heart attackIn a news release from the American Heart Association, the cardiologist who was the lead author on a paper on risks of exercise recommends that certain people should not do their own shoveling. This includes: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPeople who have had bypass surgery or coronary angioplastyPeople who have already had a heart attack or strokeCurrent and former smokersPeople who have diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterolPeople who are sedentaryObviously, advice from an internet article is not the same as medical advice from your doctor, so please defer to actual medical expertise. And if you’re healthy enough that shoveling snow is reasonably safe, you may still want to take a few precautions to make shoveling easier on your body. By the way, even though running a snowblower is hard work, it’s still usually easier on your body than shoveling. And if you need to shovel, pushing a shovel is easier on your body than lifting it repeatedly. I would add that it’s a game changer to shovel multiple times in a single snowstorm. Instead of waiting until you have six inches of snow on the ground, go out when there’s just two inches and it’ll be a breeze. Repeat that process two more times, and you’ll have a clear driveway without ever having to wrestle with ankle-deep snow. Finally, be aware of how your body is feeling as you shovel, and stop if you don’t feel well. Or as the AHA put it: \"If you experience chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or heart palpitations or irregular heart rhythms stop the activity immediately. Call 9-1-1 if symptoms don’t subside shortly after snow removal.\"\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This is the smallest and most portable of the three, clearly aimed at people who want something tough, loud, and easy to carry. Right now, Woot is selling a refurbished unit for $99.99, with free shipping for Prime members and a $6 fee for everyone else. As a “Grade A” refurbed unit, it’s been inspected, tested, and guaranteed to work like new, with cosmetic wear that isn’t noticeable from arm’s length. It also comes with a one-year eReplacements limited warranty. The same speaker has been sitting at $125 on Amazon, and price trackers show it hasn’t gone lower there, so this is a genuine drop rather than a recycled deal.\nIn actual use, the ULT Field 3 leans hard into bass. Sony squeezed a real woofer into a body that’s still backpack-friendly, and you can feel that low-end emphasis even at moderate volume. Turning on ULT mode pushes the bass further, which works well outdoors or in larger rooms, but it’s not subtle. Vocals can take a slight back seat if you don’t tweak the sound. Speaking of, the seven-band EQ in Sony’s Sound Connect app helps dial things in, especially if you want a flatter profile for podcasts or background music. The speaker is rated IP67, so it can handle dust, water, and the occasional drop without much worry, notes this PCMag review. It also supports Party Connect, letting you link it with other compatible Sony speakers for wider coverage.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBattery life is another strong point, with up to 24 hours of playback when you’re not pushing the volume too hard. At full volume, that drops closer to five hours, which is expected given the bass output. Fast charging helps: A 10-minute charge reportedly gives you about two hours of listening, which is useful when you forget to plug it in. It’s not the most balanced-sounding speaker for critical listening, and the app extras like DJ effects might feel gimmicky for some. But for portability, durability, and long battery life at this price, it’s a solid option if bass-forward sound fits your needs.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This weekend, a potentially historic winter storm is bearing down on some 200 million Americans, who may face dangerously icy conditions and significant snowfall. It's important to know your area's risk and understand the meaning and potential impact of different weather terms (advisory, watch, and warning) so you can respond quickly in the event of an emergency. You should also use the next few days to take steps to prepare your home and lower the chances of damage and danger.Winter prep starts with a thorough inspection of your property, both inside and out and top to bottom. Look for everything from roof leaks to door gaps to clogged gutters—anything that could lead to damage from snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. Make a plan for repairs and winterization to ensure your safety and comfort—not just for the next storm, but for the entire season. Here's a quick summary of the most important tasks to take care of before the temperatures drop or the snow starts to fall. \nTest your smoke and carbon monoxide detectorsThis is something that should be part of your regular home maintenance, and it's especially important when you are using your furnace and fireplace regularly (considering both fire safety and indoor air quality). Follow the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines for where to install CO detectors and how to inspect and maintain them; then check out the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) guidelines for smoke alarms. Make sure your fire extinguisher is handy and working as well. Install an easy-to-read thermometerAny thermostat will show you indoor temperature, and if you have a smart system like an Ecobee or Nest, you have real-time data at your fingertips. The CDC also recommends installing easy-to-read thermometers in locations where you'll see them frequently. This is especially important for older adults, as our sense of temperature changes as we age, increasing the risk of cold-related health issues. Fix drafty windows and doorsGaps around doors and windows keep your home drafty, which is uncomfortable and a waste of energy. Door sweeps, weatherstripping, and caulk can be used to fill spaces that allow cold air in. These are simple DIY fixes that go a long way toward lowering your heating bill and keeping your home warm. If your home has older windows, floor-to-ceiling thermal curtains can also help with insulation even if you lose heating. Winterize your outdoor faucets Before freezing temperatures arrive, make sure your outdoor plumbing is prepared—frozen pipes can burst, causing significant damage to your home. To winterize exterior faucets, remove and store hoses, shut off outdoor water, drain spigots, close them up, and insulate with covers.While you don't need to fully winterize your indoor plumbing unless your house will be vacant for an extended period of time, you should look for pipes that are uninsulated and in or near unheated spaces and consider applying insulation sleeves or heat tape. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCheck your furnaceTurn your furnace on and make sure it is working properly. Even if you don't need to heat your home right now, you don't want to scramble to schedule an emergency repair down the line when it's freezing outside. Look for common signs that your unit needs maintenance, such as unusual smells and noises, short cycling, and lack of actual heat. Replace your air filter as well. Inspect and clean your fireplaceYour fireplace or wood stove can provide heat in an emergency. Like your furnace, they need seasonal maintenance to avoid chemical buildup and ensure proper venting, both of which impact your indoor air quality and overall safety. The NFPA recommends annual cleaning, which you can do yourself. However, if it's been awhile since your fireplace was professionally inspected and cleaned, consider scheduling a chimney sweep before you start your first winter fire. You can find one online or ask your local fire department for a recommendation. Stock your snow suppliesIf you get snow in your area, make sure your shovels are accessible and restock your ice melt. If you use a snowblower, give it a thorough inspection, replace any worn or damaged parts, change the oil, top it off with fresh gas, and start it up to make sure it runs. Replenish your emergency kitYou should be prepared for storms during any season with a stock of disaster supplies so you and your family (and pets) can survive without outside aid for a few days if needed. We have a guide to creating an emergency kit if you don't have one already, but you should also check all supplies and replenish anything that has been used or is missing. For winter, be sure you also have sleeping bags, warm blankets, and climate-appropriate changes of clothes and shoes available.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Devices lose support, standards are replaced, and software becomes obsolete. So it is with Microsoft Lens, whose days are numbered. Keen observers have known about this since August, when Microsoft first announced that Lens would be retired in September and removed from app stores in November. That obviously didn't happen, as the company adjusted the deadline to Dec. 15, which also came and went. Microsoft kicked the retirement can down the road—that is, until now. Microsoft Lens was Microsoft's solution for anyone in the mid-2010s who didn't own a scanner. Rather than buy an expensive piece of hardware to digitize documents, Lens allowed people to use their smartphone camera to turn those hard copies into digital files. It was hardly the only document scanner available on app stores (Apple's Notes app has had the function built in since iOS 11), but because it was made by Microsoft, it was a good solution for getting files into Microsoft apps like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. It's also free and compatible with both Android and iOS, making the app universally accessible. We even listed it first in our roundup of the best document scanner apps from 2021. According to the app's support document, Microsoft Lens officially began retirement proceedings on Jan. 9. That doesn't mean the app is dead, though: Microsoft will still support it until Feb. 9. After that, the app will receive no updates, and Microsoft will remove it from app stores. (If you're passionate or curious about Microsoft Lens, make sure to install it before then.) No matter what, however, you'll only have another month to use it. As of March 9, you will no longer be able to create new scans in Lens, but you'll still be able to view your previous scans as long as the app remains on your device.    \nThe best alternatives to Microsoft LensOnce we settle into mid-March, Microsoft Lens users will need to choose an alternative scanning app. Fortunately, there are plenty of options on app stores to choose from. In fact, you might not need to download anything new at all: As mentioned above, iPhone users can tap into the Notes app's built-in scanner, while Google Drive users can do the same.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMicrosoft, of course, wants you to stay within the ecosystem, so they'd prefer you use OneDrive's built-in scanner. If you already have that app on your phone, it might be as good an option as any. However, there are popular, dedicated apps, like Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, and Photomyne, that offer additional features not available in built-in scanners.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

But previous models were held back because of its Tizen OS—while marketed as a monitor, Odyssey was really a TV in disguise. With the new G81SF model, Samsung has finally fixed it, returning the G8 to a proper monitor setup. And Woot is currently offering the 32-inch model at a deep discount: $769.99, $540 off the $1299.99 retail price.The removal of the Tizen OS means no software bloat, and no waiting for the TV menu to boot up before shifting to your desktop. You do lose out on the built-in speakers, but it's a worthy sacrifice.The monitor features an RGB ring at the back, with its CoreSync feature creating an ambient lighting effect by projecting the on-screen colors onto the wall behind the monitor. There's also fan-less cooling via a pulsating heat pump, which allows it to run completely silently and without a fan, while reducing burn-in risk. These are critical features in high-end QD-OLED displays. (You also get a large array of ports. Two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, USB-A hub, and a headphone jack.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn its review of the earlier model with the Tizen OS, PCMag gave it a 4-star \"Excellent\" rating, and the display panel and specs remain the same in the model currently on sale. According to PCMag's expert review, \"Rocking a full 4K resolution (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) at a maximum 240Hz refresh rate, the monitor looks fantastic and plays even better... [It] excels for gaming and does everything else to a very high standard too.\" It's a good buy, especially at this price.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I've had my JBL Charge 3 for years, and it's still thumping powerful beats just like when I first got it. If you get a chance to buy an older JBL speaker at a discount, you can rest assured you're getting a quality product at a good price—and that's what Woot is offering right now. You can currently pick up a new JBL Flip 6 at a 46% discount, bringing it to $69.95 (originally $129.95), the lowest price it has ever reached according to price tracking tools.\nThe JBL Flip 6 has been around since 2021 and was succeeded in 2025 by the JBL Flip 7; hence the massive discount you're seeing right now. Like all portable JBL speakers, the Flip 6 produces powerful sound, with a booming bass sound signature. If you don't like how it sounds out of the box, you can tweak it with the JBL companion app, the best audio app I've tested (and I've tested many). It's user-friendly, has many practical features like a full EQ adjustable setting, and it allows you to connect to other JBL speakers with Aurocast.This is a rugged outdoor speaker with an IP67 rating, meaning it's water- and dust-proof, so you can take it with you on any outdoor adventure. It will deliver about 12 hours of battery, rechargeable via USB-C, but that number will vary depending on how loud you play it. There is no speakerphone or AUX connection, and it's a mono channel unless you hook it up to other JBL speakers. It supports AAC and SBC codecs, but not AptX. You can learn more about it on PCMag's 4.0 \"excellent\" review.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou won't find a better speaker under $70 with as good a reputation or as strong a companion app. If you're looking for a portable speaker with powerful bass at a great discount, the JBL Flip 6 is a great buy.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.\"The company also posted an acknowledgement over on X, while on popular service interruption tracking website Downdetector (which is owned by the same parent company as Lifehacker), user reports of problems have been coming in steadily since about noon. They reached a peak of over 170,000 reports at around 12:50 EST, and while they've dropped steadily since then, the latest update at time of writing still saw over 60,000 reports of problems.\nI'm a Verizon customer, but my phone seems to be unaffected for now, even if I turn my wifi off and rely purely on my cell signal. That's a bit surprising, as according to Downdetector, the areas with the most reports include both New York City (likely meaning Manhattan) and Brooklyn, which would include where I'm located. Other areas reporting major disruptions include Charlotte, N.C.; Houston; Atlanta; Dallas; Philadelphia; Miami; and Ashburn, Va.As for which services are impacted, 61% of reports only point out mobile phone problems in general, but 35% of reports specifically complain about a lack of signal, while 4% report issues with mobile internet.You'll know if you're affected if your signal strength is low, which is usually indicated by four vertical bars in the top-right corner of your phone. Your phone might also display that it's in \"SOS\" Mode. This does not mean that you or your phone are in any danger, but rather, that signal is only present for contacting emergency services like 911.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, the best you can do while the outage is resolved is probably wait, although if you're connected to wifi and are still having issues calling or texting, you could try an alternative messaging app like WhatsApp, as well as ensure that wifi calling is enabled on your phone. The loss of cell service should mostly affect those relying on data from cell towers, rather than those connected to an internet router.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile Verizon is facing the brunt of user reports, T-Mobile and AT&T are also seeing their own share of outage complaints over on Downdetector. Some of these may be a case of confusion, however. On X, T-Mobile said that its network \"is operating normally and as expected,\" but that some customers may still face issues, specifically if they're trying to reach someone on a Verizon plan. AT&T posted similar sentiments, albeit with a more aggressive tone.Meanwhile, city governments are issuing their own warnings. An emergency AlertDC notification sent to Washington D.C. residents said, \"If you have an emergency and can not connect using your Verizon Wireless device, please connect using a device from another carrier, a landline, or go to a police district or fire station to report the emergency.\" While the city's advice is understandable, as it wants to prepare readers for a worst possible scenario, it's worth reiterating that, for emergency calls, phones can use any viable nearby network. If you are a Verizon customer and you need immediate help from 911, it's still best to attempt reaching out over the phone (or even text, depending on your area) before taking the extra time to visit emergency services in person. As a reminder, connecting to wifi and enabling wifi calling can help with this.As for New York, it's taking a more measured approach with its messaging. New York City's Office of Emergency Management posted to X that it is aware of the outage and that the government is \"working closely with our partners\" to asses possible impacts.\n            \n    ",

Its latest flagship portable speaker is the ULT Field 5, which launched along with the ULT Field t and ULT Tower 9 last spring, all made to be portable and rugged. This speaker falls between the ULT Field 3 and the ULT Field 7, giving a good middle ground of portability and power. Right now, you can get the biggest one of the lineup for $219 (originally $329.99), the lowest price it has been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe ULT Field 5 is a bass-heavy portable speaker that works for those who value long battery life and portability, as you can read in PCMag's \"excellent\" review. It comes with a ten-band EQ, an actual woofer (which is surprising given its portable size), an ULT mode which boosts the base, an IP67 rating (waterproof, dustproof, shockproof, and rustproof), and the ability to connect to other speakers through Party Connect.With the ULT Power on, you can expect 25 hours of battery, making this speaker competitive in its market. Blasting it at full volume will drain the battery much faster, though, giving you five hours max. A quick 10-minute charge gets you two hours of juice, which is important for a portable speaker. The sound is stereo, and you can use multi-room if you have other Sony speakers to play media simultaneously with the companion app.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis speaker is designed for parties, the outdoors, or larger working spaces. It does come with a shoulder strap that you can hook into the speaker for throwing it over your shoulder, adding to its portability. It uses the Sound Connect app, so people who are part of the Sony ecosystem will get the most out of it. You can see the battery life, control the EQ, connect to other Sony devices, and use the DJ Control feature that lets you add scratching and air horn sounds to your music.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This update addresses 114 vulnerabilities in total, including three zero-days (bugs that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before an official fix is available from the developer). As reported by BleepingComputer, security flaws were found across the following categories: 57 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, three security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 22 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, 22 information disclosure vulnerabilities, two denial of service vulnerabilities, and five spoofing vulnerabilities. Six of the remote code execution vulnerabilities and two of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" Your machine should receive security updates automatically when Patch Tuesday drops, which is around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of the month. You can check to confirm by going to Start > Settings > Windows Update and selecting Check for Windows updates\nThree zero-days patched in JanuaryOne of the three zero-days fixed this month has been actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, labeled CVE-2026-20805, is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Desktop Windows Manager that allows attackers access to memory addresses from a remote ALPC port. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) have been credited with identifying this bug. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe other two zero-days have been publicly disclosed. CVE-2026-21265 is a security bypass feature vulnerability that allows threat actors to bypass Secure Boot on systems that have not updated certificates issued in 2011 and nearing expiration. CVE-2023-31096 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in third-party Agere Soft Modem drivers that ship with supported Windows operating systems installed.

According to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments. The scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic). \nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nA nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBetterment data hackedCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. If you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.If you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look. \n\n    \n            \n            There are plenty of categories to choose from.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.The home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to sign up for a MediaWiki account if you want to be able to contribute to the site too.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nHover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.Click through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Each movie comes with a cast list.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.Obviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.Free movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

Do you wish you could take care of all those updates at once? Updatest is an application made for exactly this.I've talked about Homebrew for Mac, which is a command line tool for installing and updating Mac software. Updatest scans all the software on your computer and updates it using Homebrew, even if you didn't initially install it that way. But there's more. Many applications use an open source tool called Sparkle to offer updates, and Updatest can find and update all of them. The application can also identify applications downloaded from GitHub that have newer releases, along with any application you downloaded from the Mac App Store.Basically, if an application has updates, Updatest can find them and install them for you. To get started, click the download button on the app's website (you can also install using Homebrew, if you've already set that up). The application will tell you a bit about how it works, ask you which categories of applications you want to update using the tool, and offer to install Homebrew if you haven't done that already.\nOnce you're done with all of that, you will see a list of all the applications on your system. You can filter to see only the apps that need updates, if you want.Click any application to learn more about the update. From here you can install the update. Alternatively, you can click the Bulk Update button below the search bar to update all of your outdated applications at once. You can watch the updates happen by clicking the Terminal button in the top-right corner, or you can let the application do its thing while you work on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome updates require passwords, in which case you'll be asked to run the update command in the Terminal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd in some cases, applications from the Mac App Store won't update—in my tests, this was mostly iPad apps I've installed. The application will instead give you a link to open the App Store and install the update.These minor annoyances are inevitable, and not too burdensome. And it's nice to be able to check all of my applications for updates in once place. If you're interested, there's a 15-day free trial, allowing you to get a feel for how the application works. After that you can buy a personal license, which works on up to three Macs, for $9.99; a household license, which works on up to 10 Macs, costs $19.99.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models.

They're also often low quality, AI-generated, misinformation, or some combination of the bunch, and may have a negative impact on our attention spans and mental health. In short, they're just not that good for us. It's bad enough for grown adults to control their scrolling habits, but it's another thing entirely for children, which poses quite the a challenge.It's easy enough to ban short-form video apps entirely, like TikTok. But what about apps that have short-form content as just one pillar of the overall package? Take YouTube: You might not mind your child having limited access to the app or site to watch long-form content you approve of, but having Shorts always in the way throws a wrench in that system. Any type of short-form video feed would be an issue here, but YouTube Shorts is particularly egregious, allowing kids to watch some truly horrific content, often generated by AI. Choosing whether your kids watch YouTube ShortsLuckily, YouTube finally appears to be giving parents some control here. As spotted by TechCrunch, YouTube announced updates to its parental controls on Wednesday. While there are a few changes on the way, the headline for me concerns Shorts. Not only will YouTube let parents choose a timer for how often their kids can watch Shorts, they can choose to set the timer to zero—effectively blocking Shorts for their kids' and teens' accounts. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThis should be welcome news to any parents struggling to limit the short-form video content their kids are watching. You can let them watch other types of videos on YouTube Kids, or even standard YouTube if its a teen account, without worrying about them going down short-form video rabbit holes for hours. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe control here can be even more granular than an outright ban, too. Since you're always in control of the timer, YouTube says you can customize timers based on the scenario: You could set the Shorts timer to zero during homework time, then offer 30 minutes of scrolling after dinner. You could bump that to 60 minutes on weekends, or when in the car. If your child is under a supervised account, you'll also be able to control both custom Bedtime and \"Take a Break\" reminders. This is not the first time YouTube has offered users more control over Shorts. Last week, the company rolled out a new search filter that lets you choose to only see long-form videos in any given result, and since October, you've been able to limit the number of shorts you can watch in a day. YouTube, and parent company Google, are also expanding parental controls and enhancing protections for kids and teens. YouTube now uses AI to guess your age, and, if it believes you're under 18, will add restrictions to your account. Google also gives parents more control over supervised accounts: Previously, teens could choose to remove supervision after turning 13, but now, they need their parents to sign off on it too.     \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

These messages don't appear to be the result of a new data breach or account compromise, but rather a bug that Meta claims it has now fixed. Following a wave of suspicious account recovery requests, antivirus software provider Malwarebytes posted a warning on Jan. 9 that threat actors had stolen personal information from 17.5 million Instagram accounts. As BleepingComputer reports, there have been various claims that hackers have obtained Instagram account data from multiple API scraping incidents in the last several years but notes that there haven't been any confirmed incidents nor definitive proof of a new breach. Meta has said the issue was the result of a bug that allowed threat actors to request password reset emails, which it has since patched, and denies that user data has actually been compromised. Of course, data breaches aren't uncommon, and Meta platforms have been targeted in the past. So you should still practice good digital hygiene and stay vigilant to phishing attempts that could indicate account compromise. \nHow to keep your Instagram account secureIf you do receive an Instagram password reset email that you didn't request, you don't need to do anything with it. You can just ignore and delete the message. In general, you should avoid clicking links in security-related messages that seem urgent or sound scary (again, if you didn't initiate account recovery) as these can be phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials or other sensitive information. If you do want to change a password or update other security details for any account, you should go directly to the website or app and do so there. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you haven't already, you can (and should) enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for Instagram. On the mobile app, open the Menu from your profile page and go to Accounts Center > Password and security > Two-factor authentication. You can choose to receive login codes via authentication app (like Google Authenticator or Duo), SMS, or WhatsApp. As I've written, not all 2FA methods are created equal: SMS codes are especially easily phished, so an authentication app is probably your best option here. Finally, you can check for suspicious devices logged into your Instagram account under Accounts Center > Password and security > Where you're logged in. If you see any devices you don't recognize, select it and tap Log out. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications. Maybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.The application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).The whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.It's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.I don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Users have spent that time generating hyper-realistic vertical videos that, despite their watermarks, might already be fooling people on the internet. I, for one, see nothing good about a tool that can make these types of videos from simple prompts, perhaps outside the sheer novelty alone. But the app is undeniably popular, and, as expected, OpenAI is continuing to \"improve\" it. On Wednesday, the head of Sora, Bill Peebles, shared a roadmap of updates coming to the app, from cameos for your pets to video editing tools. Sora will soon let you make cameos of anything you wantPeebles says that \"character cameos\" are on their way in the coming days. When this feature drops, you'll be able to make cameos of just about anything you want, including your pets (Peebles suggests your dog or guinea pig), stuffed toys, as well as AI-generated characters Sora may have produced in your past videos.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nCameos are a defining, and controversial, Sora feature. It lets you scan your likeness into the app so you can create videos featuring yourself. Not only that, you can remix videos with cameos of anyone else who has scanned themself into Sora—assuming their permissions allow you to use their cameos. It's impressive tech, but it raises major ethical concerns, considering you can make someone else do or say things they never signed off on. Now, apparently, you'll also be able to do the same with the family cat or your childhood stuffed animal. Following these additional cameo options, Peebles says you'll be able to see \"the latest trending cameos in real time.\" I'm guessing the idea is to browse the most popular cameos on the platform, and, if you want to, add them to your own videos. Sora is also getting basic video editing tools. According to Peebles, this starts with the ability to stitch multiple clips together, though other \"powerful new features\" will follow. Peebles says the Sora team is also working on reducing \"excessive moderation,\" which he acknowledges is \"super annoying\" to users, as well as improving the app's performance.Speaking of apps, Android users will soon have their chance to try Sora. Right now, the app is iOS-only, but Sora's Android version is \"actually coming soon,\" Peebles says.  A reminder to be wary of what you see on the internetAs critical and cynical as I am about Sora and services like it, I can see the utility here. I imagine people will get a kick out of being able to put their pets in any situation they want. And if they want to make fried eggs sing a song, or a stuffed animal say \"hello,\" more power to them. But my main concerns with this app are not assuaged by any of these updates: Sora still lets you generate convincing videos with a simple prompt, with the only safeguard a watermark that's easy to remove if you know where to look. People were already falling for fake videos on the internet before these tools came along; now, it's becoming way too difficult to know whether what you're watching is actually real or not. If you ask me, you're better off assuming all of it is fake.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The TV app, for instance, no longer automatically rewinds or fast forwards when you press back or forward, instead navigating between buttons including \"like\" or \"subscribe.\" More than once while on TV, I've accidentally subscribed to a channel without meaning to, before realizing that I now need to press up first to get to the progress bar.Now, the changes have reached the YouTube mobile app, as first spotted by 9to5Google. While they're a bit more mild than you'll see on TV, there's still a few changes to get used to.Bigger, chunkier icons\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nBy far, the most noticeable new change is YouTube's new suite of icons, which all look like they've been hit with a \"Ctrl + B.\" Compared to the old look, the play, fast forward, and other buttons all look larger and bolder, with the idea being to make them more prominent.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSome of the buttons have also been consolidated. When watching a video in landscape, buttons that don't affect playback (like, dislike, comment, etc.) all now appear together in a pill in the bottom-left corner, rather than as separate elements.New animationsNew buttons aren't the only change YouTube has in store for you. Seeking videos also has a new animation now, and on some videos, liking now comes with a bit of extra personality.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe first is a pretty minor change. Now, when you double tap the screen to either go forward or back 10 seconds, the video will just automatically jump to the new spot and display a big \"-10\" or \"+10,\" rather than showing a quick animation of three arrows disappearing into each other with a smaller \"-10 seconds\" or \"+10 seconds\" below them.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe second is a bit cuter. On certain videos, tapping the \"like\" button will now play a custom animation, rather than simply putting some sparkles around a thumbs up. For instance, on a music video, you'll now briefly see a musical note replacing the thumbs up.Pausing no longer darkens your backgroundIt used to be that pausing a video would darken the background until you unpaused it, kind of like lights being lowered on a stage. That's no longer the case. While you'll still see the lights go slightly down while you have controls open, a paused video will now display as normal if you tap again to dismiss the controls. It's a small tweak, but could prove useful for taking screenshots. At the same time, though, I do worry that it might make it easy to think a video has frozen, if you're not paying attention.Nested comments and easier bookmarksFinally, Google has removed a few steps to saving and commenting on videos. Now, hitting the bookmark icon to save a video to a playlist has fewer steps, no longer requiring you to navigate multiple pages. Instead, it'll just pause the video and open a list of your playlists for you, where you can quickly tap the playlist you want to save your video to.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nAdditionally, comments are threaded now, easily showing who is replying to which comment. It's a great way to keep track of the flow of the conversation, although it does make each comment take up a bit of extra space.Can you get rid of the new YouTube UI?Ultimately, I'm a little torn on the new YouTube app. Certain new features, like threaded comments, just make sense to me. But the chunkier buttons do feel like they get in the way a bit to me, and I can't help but think of Fisher-Price when I see them.Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do if you don't like the new YouTube mobile interface. It's still rolling out, so it's possible you might not see every change yet. But because it's server-side, once it hits you, that's it. Even the web player is getting these changes, so leaving the app behind isn't a viable option.That said, if you're on desktop, users on both Reddit and YouTube itself are putting together extension lists that you can mix and match to customize your experience. Technically, there are browsers for mobile that will allow you to play with these as well, with Firefox being the big one these days. However, I found that most of the suggested extensions no longer worked for me or weren't available for mobile. In that case, if you're sick of how YouTube looks now, you might want to consider an alternate player app instead, like Play. It still relies on embedded videos, so it won't save you from every change, but its overall minimalist style could offer welcome relief from YouTube's increasingly busy design language.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Amazon Web Services experienced intermittent issues, throwing a huge fraction of the internet into chaos, as the sites and services built on it faltered or stopped working altogether. It was a sobering reminder that a lot of the world relies on AWS for networking, computing, and data storage. Truth be told, I was surprised to learn just how owned we really are, especially after a number of my work apps experienced issues. In fact, over four million business with a physical address use AWS for cloud-computing needs. It is the largest cloud infrastructure servicer in the world, with a whopping 30% of the market share. That's why when a global outage like this occurs, it's impossible to ignore: So many companies and products are affected, from streaming platforms like Prime Video, to social media sites like Facebook, that almost everyone who goes online will experience the disruption.But 30% is not 100%. AWS might be the market leader, but it is not the entire market. There are plenty of other cloud infrastructure companies out there offering similar services—and posing similar risks should they experience outages. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy use a cloud infrastructure company?It's not necessarily a bad thing for companies turn to an AWS for their computing needs. It's simply much more cost efficient to outsource the resources necessary for running programs, storing data, and hosting traffic, especially as businesses rapidly grow and change. Rather than spend the time and money constantly purchasing and upgrading on-site hardware, companies can pay for servers as they go. Companies like AWS will scale up or down as needed, without interruption to service—until, of course, there is an interruption to services.These companies can offer a host of cloud-based services and tools, including compute, databases, machine learning, networking, security, and storage. AWS just so happens to be the biggest of the bunch, but plenty of companies choose other cloud infrastructure options for their needs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAWS alternativesThere are many other companies offering the same services as AWS, but for our purposes, I'm going to list seven of the most popular, starting with AWS' main competitors: Microsoft Azure: Microsoft's cloud computing services is only second to AWS in terms of global market share. Microsoft obviously uses its own cloud infrastructure, but plenty of other companies do too, including Ralph Laruen, Best Buy, Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola, Abercrombie & Fitch, and even local, state, and federal governments.Google Cloud: Google Cloud is the third largest player in this space, with companies like Lowe's, Wendy's, EA, Fox Sports, Bayer, and McLaren all using its services. Alibaba Cloud: Alibaba Cloud has a large cloud computing market share, and is used by companies like Air Asia, Zara, Lenovo Group, and JNE Express. Oracle Cloud: Oracle Cloud includes customers like Quest Diagnostics, Baylor University, Smeg, Northwell Health, DHL, and MEO.Salesforce: Companies like Pacers Sports, Indeed, F1, and The Adecco Group use Salesforce's data cloud services.   IBM Cloud: Deloitte, Pfizer, Harvard, Vodafone, and even the US Open purchase cloud products from IBM Cloud.Tencent Cloud: You might know Tencent particularly from its massive games division, but its cloud services are also wide reaching. They include services for companies like L'Oréal Paris, Tim Hortons, and Dell, as well as its own subsidiaries like Supercell and DouYu. If there's a silver lining here, it's that there are more than just two or three companies powering sites and services around the globe, and we're not quite at the point where every company connected to the internet relies on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. That level of centralization would pose even larger risks than the ones we're currently living with.Still, present circumstance are, still pretty risky. AWS has 30% of the market share, Azure has 20%, and Google Cloud has 12%. Taken together, these three companies make up 62% of all cloud infrastructure companies around the globe. Yes, it's good the other 38% is spread out amongst a collection of other players, but the risk of another AWS-like outage is high. Hopefully, following Monday's debacle, there is work currently being done to prevent such a thing from happening again, but that's being optimistic.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the past 24 hours, multiple users on Reddit have complained about being unable to call 911, while the Bell carrier in Canada issued a warning that the Pixel 6 and up was also having problems contacting emergency services on its network.According to user Fabulous_Disaster730, who posted yesterday about difficulties contacting emergency services during a gas leak, her Pixel 9 Pro repeatedly prompted her to turn on wifi calling or turn off airplane mode before she could call 911, despite her having full signal on both 5G and wifi. The phone would then freeze and restart. After multiple attempts, she resorted to asking a friend to place the call for her instead.Multiple replies mentioned facing similar problems yesterday as well, across multiple networks and models of Pixel. Bell, however, was the only carrier to issue an official notice.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAside from the obvious danger, the problem with this bug is that it's not consistent. Despite seemingly having had a surge yesterday, it's been a known issue as far back as 2021. However, it doesn't affect all users, nor is it entirely predictable when or how it will pop up. While recent reports are of calls simply not going through, one user posted two months ago that their call did go through, but they only heard screeching and static on the other end of the line. These recent reports are only the latest in an ever-evolving concern.It's also not clear what's causing the problem. In 2021, the problem was attributed to Microsoft Teams, but even with that error patched up, users are still facing problems. To Google's credit, Bell said it reached out to the company shortly after it learned about yesterday's uptick in cases, and afterwards said that a fix had been issued. However, no other carriers have issued similar notices, and I wouldn't be surprised to see other users making their own complaints in the future.It's worth noting that Bell mentioned that Pixel 6 users and up were the ones affected this time around, and that the Pixel 6 also happened to release in 2021, which is when the bug first started making news. Whatever is at the core of the problem here, I wouldn't be surprised if it worked its way in on the Pixel 6 and just hasn't yet been addressed.However, given the severity of the issue, it's something that needs looking at sooner rather than later. I've reached out to Google for comment on this issue, and will update if I hear back. In the meantime, it's best to be prepared in case the worst happens. If you're on a Pixel phone, here's what you can do to contact 911 in an emergency:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, try to place a 911 callIf you have time and the danger is not immediate, it's worth trying to call 911 on your Pixel despite the issues. While users reporting problems have increased as of late, it's still not an everyone or every time problem. It's possible your call will still go through without issue.You can also text 911If, however, you are unable to call 911, it's worth remembering that in certain jurisdictions (check this regularly updated list to see if where you live is supported), you can also contact 911 via text. This is a slower method of reaching out for help, but is still better than nothing. To text 911, open your texting app, put in 911 as the recipient, and write a concise message with your issue, your location, and any necessary specifics, like cross streets, landmarks, a specific hiding location, or whether you're able to talk.Use a backup phoneWhile I don't expect someone who isn't constantly reviewing tech to have multiple phones on hand, the surest method to ensure you'll be able to call 911 if you're on a Pixel is to keep a backup phone that isn't a Pixel handy. This could be a landline or another cell phone. Crucially, it can be an old cell phone, even one that isn't actively attached to a phone plan. So long as your phone is able to connect to a network, it's legally required to be able to call 911, so if you have an old phone you've upgraded from and haven't traded in laying around, it may be smart to keep it charged up in case you need it in an emergency.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Many videos have gained hundreds of thousands of views with claims that weighted vests will \"transform your body\"—a claim that, to be fair, is par for the course in any fitness trend. \"Weighted vest walks\" are popular enough to be parodied, and even if I find those videos a little mean-spirited, they do point to an important question: Does this trendy fitness accessory actually deliver on its promises?Let's dig into what science really says about weighted vests—and what they can (and can't) do for your body.The claim: Weighted vests can build bone density or stop bone lossI can see how this theory sounds legit. Bones respond to mechanical stress by becoming stronger—it's why astronauts lose bone density in zero gravity, and why weight-bearing exercise is recommended for osteoporosis prevention. So logically, strapping on extra weight should signal your bones to bulk up, right? Not exactly.\nAccording to Dr. Leah Verebes, a professor at the Touro School of Health Science's DPT program, the reality is more nuanced. \"Some research, particularly among elderly persons and postmenopausal women, suggests that the use of a weighted vest while exercising, or plain walking, can slow bone loss or improve bone density modestly—especially in the legs and hips,\" she says.However, the gains are far from dramatic. Verebes notes that \"results are variable and gains are minimal.\" Traditional resistance training like weightlifting and higher-impact activities like jogging or jumping produce significantly better results. A 2023 review found that while weighted vests may help maintain bone mineral density, the overall quality of evidence supporting this benefit remains low to moderate.Weighted vests can help maintain bone strength, particularly for people who can't tolerate high-impact exercise due to joint issues or other limitations. But they're not a substitute for proper resistance training or impact activities.The claim: Wearing a weighted vest builds muscle and increases strength.Here's where expectations need serious adjustment. Yes, adding weight to your body does increase the resistance during bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and step-ups. And yes, this can contribute to improvements in muscular endurance and modest strength gains. But there's a catch.\"Vest walking also increases caloric expenditure and activates muscles more than regular walking, but the weight is typically too low to induce significant muscle growth,\" Verebes says. Most weighted vests are designed to be 5-15% of your body weight—enough to make your workout harder, but not enough to trigger substantial muscle building.Think of it this way: If you weigh 150 pounds, a 10% weighted vest adds just 15 pounds. That's less resistance than you'd use for a basic strength training exercise. \"Significant muscle growth continues to require progressive resistance training with more substantial weights,\" Verebes says.So, weighted vests can intensify your workout and improve muscular endurance, but they won't replace a proper strength training program if your goal is building significant muscle mass.The risks nobody's posting aboutWhile social media showcases people effortlessly crushing workouts in weighted vests, the reality is that adding load to your body comes with real risks. Verebes says that \"too much excess weight can cause strain on joints, especially the knees, hips, and lower back.\" The increased load can also impair balance and increase fall risk, a particular concern for older adults who might be using vests specifically to improve bone health.Perhaps most concerning is the risk of overuse injuries when people add weight too quickly. \"Professionals recommend starting with a light vest—roughly 5–10% body weight—and adding to it gradually as strength and tolerance improve,\" Verebes says.What actually works for building strong bones and musclesIf you're serious about improving your musculoskeletal health, Verebes offers evidence-based recommendations:Prioritize resistance training. Weightlifting or using resistance bands remain the most effective methods for keeping bones and muscles strong. Progressive overload—gradually increasing the weight you lift—is key to continued improvement.Include impact and weight-bearing exercise. Walking, hiking, stair climbing, and jumping all provide bone stimulation. Activities that involve impact force your bones to adapt and strengthen.Support exercise with proper nutrition. You can't out-train a poor diet. Adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D are essential for maintaining bone and muscle health. Without proper nutrition, even the best exercise program will fall short.So, should you use a weighted vest?Look, weighted vests aren't worthless. They can add challenge to bodyweight exercises and walking routines, providing modest improvements in muscle endurance and bone maintenance, particularly for older adults or those unable to do high-impact activities.But as Verebes says, \"they are not a shortcut to get to stronger bones and bigger muscles overnight. For significant improvements, regular resistance training and impact exercise remain the gold standard.\"The bottom line? Weighted vests are a tool, not a miracle solution. If you do decide to try a weighted vest, start conservatively with 5-10% of your body weight, add load gradually, and pay attention to how your joints respond. And crucially: Always speak with your doctor first, especially if you have existing joint problems, balance issues, or bone density concerns.\n            ",

Techniques and plans that call for prioritizing your to-dos, for instance, generally expect you to prioritize your to-dos for that day. The best scheduling advice also typically revolves around how you designate and take on chunks of time throughout a single day. But sometimes—or often—you work on things that span a longer period of time, so you need productivity tips that are more expansive too. And while too much pre-planning can feel daunting, there's a method you can start using right away that can help you more effectively structure your time in the longer term. It's called \"task batching.\" What is task batching?At its most basic, task batching is the act of grouping similar tasks or responsibilities together and completing them around the same time. Ideally, you can work on all the tasks at once, somewhat multitasking but still staying in the same frame of mind for all the jobs. Your goal here is to avoid context switching, or changing mental energies between tasks. While it's true that multitasking makes you worse at everything—which is why I've sworn off it—this isn't the same thing.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFor instance, instead of jumping from your inbox to paying bills to taking video meetings to washing dishes to cleaning, you can batch the emails and video calls together, batch the dishes and cleaning together, and save the bills for a different chunk of the day (or the week). Keeping yourself in the same mind frame will help you stay focused instead of allowing your thoughts to be pulled in a bunch of different directions.You already do task batching without thinking about it. When shopping for gifts, for example: Let's say you have to buy new shoes for your kid and your spouse, a gift for your bracelet-loving mother-in-law, one for your necklace-loving sister, and a candle for yourself. At the mall, you wouldn't pick one pair of shoes at Foot Locker, run to the jewelry store for your mother-in-law, head back to Foot Locker for the other shoes, circle back to the jewelry store for your sister's necklace, etc. You'd group these purchases together, getting everything you needed in each store you went into before moving to the next one. If one of the stores was in a different place altogether, you'd probably kick those purchases to a different day. That all just makes sense—and you can apply that same duh logic to your other to-dos.How to batch your tasks effectivelyAt the start of each week, start with your regular to-do list, but then group together the similar things and schedule those groups for specific days. For example, if you need to buy dog food, school supplies, and groceries, schedule a shopping trip for one day of the week. If you have dinner scheduled with a friend and also need to call your mom to ask how her book club went, try to do all those social check-ins on the same day. Writing-intensive work goes in a batch, no matter if it’s for school, work, or pleasure. Personal and professional emails all get handled in one batch. Household tasks go in a batch, whether they’re cleaning or unpacking from a trip.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you have a big party or event coming up, schedule the prep for a single day instead of picking up one necessity one day and another the next. Complete your similar tasks in one day so you can move on and focus on the next group the following day.One key step here is not just pre-scheduling your batches at the beginning of the week, but checking in on their progress as the week goes on. Deadlines can change (or be missed), and what was low-priority on Monday may suddenly be important on Wednesday. Task batching helps you to get more done in big chunks, which frees you up for the unexpected emergencies or responsibilities that might crop up. The reason this works is that it keeps you in \"the zone.\" Instead of getting pulled in a bunch of directions and constantly thinking about the gear-shift necessary in order to move to the next disjointed task, you remain in the flow. On email day, you move through your inbox more quickly because you remain focused on that one task the entire time. On cleaning day, each chore seems less individually daunting because you're crossing off a bunch of them in sequence. When you're in that kind of  flow state, things start to come easier and you can focus more deeply— plus, this strategy allows you to think ahead instead of constantly jumping from responsibility to responsibility. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

My iPhone can handle just about anything you used to need a traditional wallet for. Most (if not all) of my purchases are made via Apple Pay or QR code, my phone holds all of my pictures, and most of my receipts go straight to my email. Basically the only I keep my wallet around is to carry my ID. Once my state starts supporting Apple’s digital ID feature, however, things will change between me and my wallet—provided that support ever comes.Since iOS 15.4, Apple has allowed you to add a driver’s license or other state ID to your iPhone’s digital wallet. That doesn’t mean you’ve been needlessly carrying your ID around since then—states have been slow to roll out their own support for the feature, and most have yet to sign on at all. When I first covered this feature in 2022, only two states actively allowed you to add your ID to your iPhone, while 10 more (plus Puerto Rico) had confirmed plans to offer the option eventually, on a loose timeline of “soon.” Fast forward three years, and just 9 states and one territory now officially allow you to add IDs to Wallet.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThese states support digital ID nowHere’s the full list as it stands in June 2025:ArizonaCaliforniaColoradoGeorgiaHawaiiIowaMarylandMontanaNew MexicoNorth DakotaOhioPuerto RicoWest VirginiaSupport is still \"coming soon\" in these statesThese states had originally pledged that support was \"coming soon,\" but after nearly three years, still haven't committed:ConnecticutKentuckyMississippiOklahoma UtahAirports where you can use a digital ID in Apple WalletNow, be warned: You can't simply hand a cop your iPhone when you get pulled over. There are specific, limited use cases for this feature. Right now, that means identifying yourself at the airport, as well as at select businesses. Apple worked with the TSA to make this happen, and while it used to maintain an active list of supported airpots, it seems to have taken it down. This is the list as it was last updated:Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG)Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)Denver International Airport (DEN)Des Moines International Airport (DSM)Eastern Iowa Airport (CID)Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH)Los Angeles International (LAX)Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU)Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)San Francisco International Airport (SFO)San Jose Mineta International (SJC)Missoula International Airport (MSO)Great Falls International Airport (GTF)Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (BZN)Billings Logan International Airport (BIL)Lea County Regional Airport (HOB)Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ)This feature will also work with participating businesses to verify your age, including bars, restaurants, liquor stores, festivals, concerts, and certain age-restricted apps. However, there is no list of venues that support this feature.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to add a digital ID to your iPhoneIf you do live in a supported state, setting up the feature is simple. Open Wallet, then, tap the (+) in the top right, then choose “Driver’s License and ID Cards.” Choose your state, then choose whether to add the ID to your iPhone 8 or newer, as well as your Apple Watch Series 4 or newer. (There are caveats here: California requires an iPhone XS or later running iOS 17.5 or newer, or an Apple Watch Series 4 running at least watchOS 10. Puerto Rico requires an iPhone XS or later running iOS 18.1 or newer, or an Apple Watch Series 6 or later running watchOS 11 or newer.)   Either way, you’ll need to scan your ID with your iPhone’s camera, then scan your face to prove your identity. Once complete, send all information to your state to confirm. If you live in North Dakota, you will need to pay a $5 fee to use this feature.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe next time you fly from a participating airport, you can unlock your iPhone and place it next to the ID scanner. You’ll see your digital ID appear, complete with all information you will be sharing with the TSA if you approve (name, date of birth, sex, issuing authority, and issue and expiration dates).\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Put simply, your brain needs regular periods of downtime to maintain peak operation. After periods of intense work, taking a brief break doesn’t just improve your mood—it can  actually boost your concentration and performance. So if you want to be truly productive, you should schedule those rest periods into your busy day.The case for scheduling your \"brain breaks\"It’s one thing to know you need downtime, but another to actually find time for it in your day. Through the course of a busy schedule—working, cleaning, studying, taking care of kids, driving, and doing all the other things on your to-do list—you might have the best of intentions when it comes to taking breaks, but not actually do it in the moment. That’s why you should schedule them.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn one episode of HBO's Succession, the character Shiv Roy actually set aside a block of time on her calendar for crying. You might not need to cry, but Shiv’s got the right idea: Open the calendar on your phone and add in blocks of personal time throughout your day, however you might spend it. Maybe you like to scroll TikTok, look at recipes, work on your creative projects, close your eyes for a moment, or call a friend. Whatever you’d like to do, prioritize it seriously by building the space for it into your schedule. If you use a shared calendar at work or home, block it out so everyone can see. You don’t need to publicly state what it’s for; you’ll know. And you won’t be letting your colleagues or family down since you’ll be even more productive when it’s over.Most importantly, stick to it. Even 15 minutes per day can be beneficial, but not if you don’t adhere to your plan. Being serious about taking time for yourself will help you build the habit and give you something to look forward to when working gets hard, so treat it like an important step in your workday.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to time your breaks for maximum productivityThere are a few approaches you can take to ensure your downtime proves to be effective. First, you should be time blocking and time boxing. These similar but distinct techniques involve not only determining exactly how much time you'll need for a given task, but using a calendar or planner to mark it all down. Using something like Google Calendar or even a physical planner, you'll account for every second of your day, so the entire column is filled up with back-to-back entries—but not all of those entries will be for work. Here is your chance to slot in something enjoyable, like a 2 p.m. matcha run or an episode of SVU at 8 p.m. You'll feel better about scheduling downtime if you're doing it alongside the designation of work tasks, and if you can see it all concretely represented in one place. Second, use the Pomodoro method. This famous productivity hack calls on you to work for 25 minutes, take a five-minute break, work another 25, break again, and repeat the cycle four times before taking a longer break. Building in smaller breaks this way might make the exercise more palatable if you are struggling to justify off-time. Plus, Pomodoro is more flexible than it seems at first, and a lot of variations exist. Take animedoro, for instance: you work for 40 to 60 minutes with a 20-minute break, about the length of an episode of anime. You don't need to watch anime, of course, nor be so rigid with your timing: The important part is being conscientious about interspersing your work sessions with small breaks. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Apple officially entered its M5 era on Wednesday. The company not only announced the new M5 chip, placing a major emphasis on its AI processing power, but also the first batch of new devices that will ship alongside it. If you're interested in buying an Apple device with the company's latest and greatest hardware, it's all just around the corner. That said, the list of product announcements was limited. While Apple revealed M5 versions of the iPad Pro and Vision Pro will be available starting on Oct. 22, it only showed off one M5 Mac: the 14-inch MacBook Pro. The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs are still stuck on M4 for now, as are the Pro and Max versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. But a few days later, we know when that might change.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMore M5 Macs are on the horizon If you're holding out on buying one of the current M4 laptops in the hope that Apple will soon upgrade them with M5 chips, you're going to be waiting a little while longer. As Bloomberg's typically reliabe Mark Gurman reports, Apple doesn't plan to refresh its MacBook Air line until next spring. That goes for a host of other Mac products as well, including M5 versions of the Mac Studio and Mac mini, in addition to new Mac monitors. It's a similar story for the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pros. While Gurman doesn't specify whether these laptops are also coming in the spring, he does report Apple is planning on refreshing the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with the new chips in \"early 2026.\" Gurman says the new MacBook Pros will recycle Apple's current design, and I'd imagine the same will hold true for the M5 MacBook Airs. The M5 14-inch MacBook Pro looks identical to its M4 counterpart, after all, with the only notable changes (other than the M5 chip) being a boosted 24 hour battery life and faster SSD.  If you're currently holding out on buying a new MacBook, I don't think there's much reason to wait for the M5, unless you just really want the newest hardware Apple has to offer. The current M4 machines are excellent, and, in the case of the MacBook Air, can be bought for a very reasonable price—especially when they go on sale. During October Prime Day, stores offered the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air for only $799, which is an excellent value. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple is also working on a touchscreen MacBook ProIn this same report, Gurman discusses Apple's current plans for a MacBook Pro with a touchscreen, which would be a dramatic refresh—no Mac has ever shipped with a touchscreen, unless you count the controversial Touch Bar (RIP), which only added a touch-based strip to the top of the keyboard. According to Gurman, these touchscreens will be OLED, which the company already uses in its iPad Pros and iPhones. You'll still have the standard keyboard and trackpad, so you could ignore the touchscreen entirely, though Apple is considering replacing Touch ID with Face ID, again mirroring its iPads and iPhones. To that point, the \"notch\" (the large camera cutout at the top of the screen) may be replaced by a smaller hole-punch design, reminiscent of the iPhone's Dynamic Island. Alongside the touchscreen, Apple may update the design of these MacBook Pros to be thinner and lighter, and they may run on the M6 chip, rather than a version of the M5. They may also include a new hinge and lid design to compensate for the force of touching the display. Remember, this would be a new design challenge for the MacBook line, which has never had to deal with users purposely touching the display before.Gurman says the touchscreen MacBook Pro won't debut until late 2026 or even early 2027. When it does arrive, it will likely come with an increased price tag of at least \"a few hundreds dollars more than current versions.\" Right now, the M4 Pro MacBook Pros start at $1,999 for the 14-inch model, and $2,499 for the 16-inch model. Apple would be upgrading the hardware here considerably, so the increased price tag isn't without merit. But if you're looking for the best value Mac possible, it's challenging to beat the current M4 MacBook Air—especially when it's on sale.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

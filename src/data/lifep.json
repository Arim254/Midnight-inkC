The company already has AI tools that let you ask Gemini for directions to your destination, or get more info about it, and today, it's rolling out new features to help turn the chatbot into a (to borrow a term from Microsoft) copilot.With Gemini in Google Maps, you'll be able to ask open-ended questions and even have the AI take action for you, based on its responses. The idea is to make the app easier to work with while driving, which, yes, means you can also wake the bot with a simple \"Hey Google.\"Let's say you get peckish while driving. You'll be able to wake the bot with your voice, ask it for restaurants along your drive, and then have it alter your route to direct you to one of them. Or, if you have a passenger with you, they could also summon the bot with a Gemini icon in the top-right corner of the Google Maps screen.This is a major update compared to prior AI integration in Maps, which was mostly restricted to asking questions about certain routes or destinations before you started driving.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGemini will purportedly make Google Maps routes easier to followBut even if you're not actively talking to the AI to help you navigate, it'll still supposedly make Maps better for you. Rather than relying on generic instructions like \"turn right in 500 feet,\" Google says Maps will now also sometimes direct users by pointing out easy-to-spot landmarks along their route instead. That means you might get an instruction saying \"turn right after the Thai Siam Restaurant,\" with the restaurant itself being highlighted on your Maps app as you approach. To do this, the bot will cross-reference Google Street View photos with your route. I'll admit I'm a little skeptical that it might pick an easy-to-miss landmark—I don't trust myself to be able to spot the right restaurant while driving—but if it works, it could be more intuitive than trying to figure out how many feet are between me and my turn.Gemini will work with other apps from within MapsThere's also integration to help you better interact with Google's other apps while in Maps, like Calendar. The company says that, while talking to the bot about your route, you could also ping it to add an event to Calendar; assuming you've already given it permission to do so, it'll automatically follow through on your request. The company's also added a Google Lens button to Maps, so once you arrive at wherever you're going, you'll be able to point your phone at landmarks or your destination and ask Gemini for more details about them without having to leave Maps.Smarter commutesOutside of connecting with other apps, Maps is also getting some of the same features as Waze, but with a twist. Google is adding a feature called Proactive Traffic Alerts to Maps, which sets Gemini to monitor disruptions to your most commonly traveled routes in the background. The idea is that you likely don't open Maps or Waze for your daily commute, which means you're not getting traffic alerts while you drive. Now, the AI will work for you while the app is closed, too, and will notify you on its own if it detects a crash or road closure while you're on one of your routine drives.The catch to all of this? There are plenty of ways it could go wrong, and there's no way to test it yet. Imagine the AI hallucinates a landmark that isn't there or has closed, and you miss a needed turn. In a roundtable with journalists (h/t The Verge), Google Maps product director Amanda Moore insisted that all training is \"using the actual place information in the real world\" and said \"there should be no hallucinations on places to stop at or things like that,\" but this is definitely something I'd want to try out first in a low stakes environment, rather than diving into it immediately on a cross-country road trip. (Even if a landmark is real, that doesn't automatically mean pointing it out will be useful.)When you can try Gemini in Google MapsUnfortunately, it'll take a little while before you can try out any of these new features. Gemini-based navigation starts rolling out \"in the coming weeks\" and Lens in Maps is set for \"later this month.\" Proactive traffic alerts and landmark-based navigation start their rollouts today, but it might still be a bit until they hit your iOS and Android device.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        As a tech journalist, I've got Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS devices at home—not because I'm especially wealthy, but because I need to write about all of these platforms, all of the time—and it's my trusty Chromebook that I find myself turning to more often than not.The usual argument against Chromebooks is that they're just a Chrome browser: Windows and macOS give you the same Chrome browser, and much more besides. However, sometimes less is more, as I'll get to below. Sadly, it seems Google is less keen on Chromebooks than I am. The last Google-made Pixelbook launched in 2019, and it's been left to the likes of Asus, Acer, HP, Samsung, and others to keep new Chromebooks coming in. If you're reading, Google, it's high time we had a new Pixelbook.\nChromebooks cut down on the clutterThere is the argument that Windows and macOS give you the Chrome browser plus a lot more, but most of the time, I don't really need the \"more\"—unless I've got some detailed image edits to do, or want to play some games. Almost everything I need runs on the web.There are a lot fewer software updates, background programs, app assistants, and system utilities to think about. While ChromeOS does have updates, they're mostly done seamlessly in the background, and applied whenever you next reboot your Chromebook.Another chore I don't have to regularly take care of on my Chromebook is tidying up the desktop or my local folders, because there isn't really anything to download, save, or sync. The laptop file system and internal storage is tidier by default, because I never use it.Chromebooks save everything instantly\n    \n            \n            No save button required.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAll the work I do on my Chromebook is inside a browser, and usually inside Google apps like Google Docs and Gmail. That means everything is instantly saved—should a power cut or a system crash happen, I don't have to worry about losing what I've been working on.I don't need to check for open programs and files in the background that I might have forgotten about, and if I need to jump up and do something else quickly, I can just shut my laptop and I'm done—I'm not clicking through dozens of save dialogs first.Chromebooks put everything on the webWhen you're working inside web apps all the time, without the option of locally installed tools, syncing is seamless. To work on a document that I need to access across Windows and macOS, for example, I need to think about saving, syncing, and app compatibility.When I'm working in Google Docs in a Chromebook, everything syncs automatically. I can even have a document open simultaneously across ChromeOS, Windows, and macOS, and jump between them as needed to make edits—something which saves a lot of time.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChromebooks tie in tightly to the Google ecosystem\n    \n            \n            Android phones and Chromebooks play nicely together.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI can understand that Chromebooks may have less appeal if you're not always using Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Google Docs, Chrome, and everything else Google makes—but for someone heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (like me), they make a lot of sense.If you've got an Android phone, for example, you can use it to set up a Chromebook, share files across both devices, respond to text messages from ChromeOS, and get hotspot access with a click. There's a level of integration you don't get on other platforms.Chromebooks actually work as distraction-free devicesOne of the criticisms leveled at Chromebooks is that they're pretty much useless without an internet connection, but that's only partly true. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and even Gmail actually work perfectly well offline now.If I'm traveling without steady wifi, I enjoy using my Chromebook as a distraction-free device, getting through a ton of writing and email replying without constantly switching tabs. When wifi returns, everything I've done gets synced back to the web automatically. While we're on the subject of ChromeOS being useless when it's not online, I think it's fair to say internet access is almost ubiquitous now (via public wifi or phone hotspots), and that Windows and macOS aren't particularly useful either when the web is cut off.\n            ",

But when you have a bunch of tasks and don’t even know where to start with scheduling them, you need an efficient method to decide what to get on right away, what to delegate, and what to forget about. Essentially, not only do you need to know what you need to do, but you need to rank those tasks based on how crucial they are, how much time they'll take, and what you'll need to get them done.What is the Eisenhower Matrix?This assessment and productivity tool is named for former president Dwight Eisenhower, who once quoted Dr. J. Roscoe Miller’s proclamation, “I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” Apologies to Dr. Miller, but the more famous man ended up with the honor of having this system named after him. Further apologies to both men, but I didn't fully get this quote when I first read it. To me, important things are pretty urgent, even if their due date is far off. Still, the quote stands as it is and the method for prioritizing tasks that sprang from it is effective, regardless of any word salad that came first. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, you draw a standard matrix with two intersecting lines that create four quadrants. The X axis represents urgency and the Y axis represents importance, so the top left quadrant will show you tasks that are both urgent and important; the top right quadrant houses tasks that are not urgent but are important; the bottom left quadrant is for tasks that are not important but are urgent; and the bottom right quadrant contains tasks that are not urgent and not important. This four-way divvying makes a lot more sense to me than the original claim that \"the important are never urgent,\" because it recognizes that they can be. It looks like this:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lidiia Lykova / iStock via Getty Images\n                    \n    \nHow to use the Eisenhower MatrixYou can create your own matrix on paper or with software like draw.io or even specialty services like eisenhower.me. Next, just plug your tasks into the matrix, sorting them by their combination of urgency and importance. The real key is what you do next.The quadrants have secondary purposes beyond identifying what is urgent or important: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe top left quadrant is for tasks you have to buckle down and do now.The top right quadrant is for tasks you need to schedule to do in the future.The bottom left quadrant represents tasks you need to delegate to someone capable.The bottom right quadrant shows you the tasks you can simply delete or put off.Once you see all your duties on the matrix, delegate the urgent-and-not-important ones, schedule the important-but-non-urgent ones, and get to work on your pressing, upper-right-quadrant tasks. If the deadline is seriously looming, do those first before worrying about delegation or scheduling. This visual representation of how important and urgent each responsibility is can help you figure out what to devote your time to instead of wasting time panicking about how much you think you have to get done.Use of the matrix is especially helpful for people who think visually, but don't forget that you still need to think strategically. Consider moving from the Eisenhower Matrix to a rigid to-do list, like the 1-3-5 list. That calls on you to plan your day around one major task, three medium ones, and five small ones. Obviously, those urgent and important tasks will be the first ones you try to take on, but in addition to factoring in their urgency and importance, you have to factor in the time and resources they'll take. The most urgent, important, and resource-heavy task should be your one major to-do list item. Ones that are still important but require less of you fill in those three in the middle. Five small tasks can include things that are important but not urgent and can even include the act of delegating the ones you don't have to do. The matrix is just the first step to getting to work. I'd also recommend using a system like kanban here. You need to consider the resources you have available, not just what needs doing. It might be urgent and important to clean your home, but if you don't have supplies, the more pressing task is actually going to the store. The same goes for a project you need to work on when you're waiting on a team member to send you a crucial piece of information you can't move forward without. In that case, it would make more sense to work on a less-urgent task while you wait, even if the project is technically more pressing. Using a system that takes into account the time and resources necessary to do something will help you get a clearer picture of your prioritized tasks and make your day even more productive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take satellite connectivity for example: For most of the time cellphones and smartphones have existed, losing cell signal meant your mobile device was largely useless. With satellite connectivity, however, as long as you're within range of a satellite, you can continue to make calls and send texts. It's remarkable, for both the convenience of communication, as well as your safety. Right now, there are only a few companies leading the satellite connectivity charge, at least as far as consumer technology goes. T-Mobile is the only carrier pushing it, having partnered with Starlink to offer satellite communications to its customers. But you don't need T-Mobile for satellite connectivity if you have an iPhone: Since 2022, Apple has been building the iPhone's ability to connect to satellites, starting with Emergency SOS via Satellite (the ability to reach out to emergency services over satellite), before rolling out general satellite messaging with iOS 18. Whether you have T-Mobile, an iPhone, or both, it's possible to send your friend a text in the middle of nowhere, assuming you have a clear line of site to a satellite overhead. Amazing. And according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has some major plans to expand the iPhone's satellite connectivity capabilities.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\"Natural usage\" improvementsPerhaps most importantly, Apple wants you to be able to connect to satellites without the need for an unobstructed view of the sky. Right now, that's arguably one of the technology's biggest hurdles: It's great when you have a clear path between your iPhone and a satellite, but if there's something in the way—say, a bunch of trees, or if you're inside a building—the signal might not reach. The company is working on what is called \"natural usage\" improvements, which would support satellite connectivity across a wider variety of situations. Maybe your iPhone is in your pocket, or you're in your car, but it's as if you're outside in a wide open clearing. Apple Maps via satelliteOnce you're able to connect to satellites in more places, the other new features become even more useful. That includes a new version of Apple Maps that supports satellites, which would let you use the app without needing wifi or cellular. This is probably the feature I'd be most be excited for: It can be so stressful trying to pull up directions in an area with low to no signal, so to know you almost always have a way to connect Maps—even if it's slower than usual—would be a relief. Sending photos via satelliteMessaging is another area that will reportedly see some improvement: While you can currently text over cellular, Gurman says Apple is working on supporting sending photos over satellite as well.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThird-party supportIt won't just be Apple's own apps and services that are benefitting, either. Gurman says Apple is working on an API to let third-party developers add satellite support to their apps as well. Apple's own software may have the best experience, but it does open the door for expanded support. Other navigation apps, like Google Maps, could potentially connect to satellite this way. If you prefer it over Apple Maps, you wouldn't have to stick with your iPhone's built-in maps app when you don't have cell service. More coverage for future iPhonesWhile it wouldn't impact current iPhone owners, the iPhone 18 will likely support 5G NTN, which lets cell towers themselves connect to satellites to boost coverage.   When these features will launchApple can't add all of these improvements on their own, unfortunately. According to Gurman, the company will need Globalstar, the company that builds this satellite infrastructure, to make hardware improvements on their end. Assuming that happens, the idea of \"dead zones\" may be a relic of the first quarter of the 21st century.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Having previously been tested as an experimental flag, Google Chrome's Split View feature is now rolling out in the stable version of the browser (version 142). It doesn't seem to be live for everyone at the same time, but some people are seeing it. (I've got it in Chrome on my Mac, but not yet on Windows.) To check you're on the latest version of Chrome, click the three dots (top right) in a browser tab, then choose Settings and About Chrome. If an update is available, it'll be downloaded, and you can restart your browser to apply it.If you're running the latest version of Chrome and still don't see Split View, you can either wait for the feature to reach you or switch the flag on. Type \"chrome://flags/#side-by-side\" into your browser address bar and hit Enter, then enable the feature and restart your browser. You should then have Split View.\nIt works exactly as you might guess from the name: Split View enables you to have two sites or apps open in the same tab, so you can, for example, dive deep into a Lifehacker article while also keeping an eye on social media. It works much better than just having two Chrome windows up side-by-side in Windows or macOS.How to create a Split ViewThere are a couple of ways to create a Split View. One is to right-click on a tab header and then choose Add tab to new split view from the menu that pops up: The selected tab takes up one half of the Chrome window, and in the other half you can choose another open tab (if there aren't any other open tabs, you'll see the New Tab page).The other method is to click and drag an open tab (using its header), or a web link, to the far left or far right of another tab—you should then see a small space open, with a Create split view label. Getting the dragging and positioning right can take a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty straightforward.\n    \n            \n            Look for a new Split View feature in Chrome.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAfter that, the split tab works more or less like any other normal tab. You can drag it into a different position or into a different window, and you can right-click on it to access the tab options (for muting or pinning, for example). The split view tab will have two small \"x\" icons on it, for closing either half of the tab separately—to close them both, right-click on the tab and choose Close.Whenever you're in a split tab, you'll see a new icon on the Chrome toolbar, which you can click to access related features: You can separate the two views, close the left or the right view, or swap the views over from this toolbar button. The same options are available if you right-click on the Split View tab header.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow you can use Split ViewSplit view can help any time you need two webpages or web apps on screen at once. One of Google's own suggestions is keeping a document open while you're on a video call, so you can make notes more easily.It's going to work well for any kind of research or note-taking where you're looking something up and then having to write about it. It may also be less than ideal for our attention spans, because you can load up a video on one half of your Split View, and then scroll through social media on the other half.\n    \n            \n            Two sites open in Split View.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can adjust the sizes of each pane by dragging the divider in the middle, though you are limited overall by the size of the Chrome window. You're also able to switch to different websites within a Split View by typing into the address bar as normal—just make sure you've selected the right half of the pane first.The same sort of effect has long been possible in Windows and macOS by snapping two Chrome windows to each side of the screen, but there's something more convenient and straightforward about having two pages up in the same tab. I can see this being something I make use of a lot, especially on an ultrawide monitor.\n            ",

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n            Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n    \n        \n        Finding great travel deals is a skill, but it’s one that can be honed—if you know where to source a bargain, can be patient and flexible, and if you take advantage of the 24-hour free federal cancelation policy to lock in a time-sensitive opportunity. One unusual way to save on your travels? There are websites that let you buy other people's non-refundable vacations, from flights to hotels to cruises, that they are looking to offload. If this sounds intriguing, it can be a great way to save—although you might not find Black Friday travel deals like you might on tech products, people have to cancel or give up on travel plans all year round. With that said, here are some of the best travel websites and tools you can use to snag your next trip on the cheap.Google Flights' explore toolI expect most people to know this one, but I have to start the list somewhere. For those who might not know, Google Flights has an “explore” tool where you see a map of your potential destinations from your local airport and their prices. This is great when you don't have a specific destination in mind but want to get away and see where you could potentially travel to. You can scroll through the planet and find some bargains that you might've never seen otherwise. Quick tip: If you have a budget, use the filters on the top left to set it and see where you can afford to travel to around the world. Use Skyscanner to find the cheapest flightsYes, Google Flights is more user-friendly and has cool features, but if you mean business and are looking for the cheapest flight options you can find, Skyscanner is what you want to use. Here, you’ll find flights that will not even appear on Google Flights, and it even has an explore-like tool similar to Google’s where you simply input your local airport, select “whole month” for dates, and click “search” to find all the possible low-cost destinations for that month (I found a direct flight to Cancun from my home in Atlanta for $183). You can catch last-minute flight deals and set alerts for cheap flights as well.Shop second-hand vacation packages from people who can't get refundsImagine you buy a whole package deal for a family vacation months in advance but, like most people, you forego the travel insurance. You have a family emergency and can no longer take the trip. What can you do? Sell your vacation on the internet. Websites like Sparefare, Roomer, Plans Change, and Transfer Travel let you buy other people's vacations that they can no longer use themselves. You can both save money and get these people out of a sticky situation. Here's a quick breakdown of your options:TransferTravelTransferTravel is like the Facebook Marketplace of travel plans. You can find anything from cruises, to flights, to hotels, events, and more. It's the most wide-ranging of all of these websites that offer transferable travel products. SpareFareSpareFare focuses on flight tickets or vouchers, hotel reservations, and holiday packages. You'll be connected directly with the seller to get their non-refundable bookings. SpareFare also helps you manage the name change process for airline tickets, which can get a bit complicated if you do it by yourself.RoomerIf you're focusing on finding hotels at a bargain, use Roomer. The website focuses on showing you non-refundable bookings from people desperately trying to recoup any money they can. You can find hotels from all over the world and filter by number of occupants, dates, and location. You might not always find something available where you're staying, but if you do, you'll be a happy camper. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nPlansChangePlansChange is exactly like Roomer, but it's smaller in scope and reach. It doesn't hurt to check both when you find yourself looking for a bargain stay.Use SecretFlying to set up alerts for their “Error Fares”Airlines make mistakes sometimes, and as a savvy traveler, you need to be ready to take advantage of them when you can. SecretFlying is a travel deal website that works like many others, but it also has  a special tool to find cheap flights that exist because of mistakes that airlines make. (For example, there was an enticing Chicago to London round-trip for only $58 last month.) The error fares go fast, and many might not logistically work for you, but if you ever do catch one of these, you’ll be bragging about it for years to come. Use the Travel Arrow extensionIf you're still only using Google Flights to do your searching, you could be missing out on some cheaper options. Travel Arrow is an extension you can install on your browser that will cross-reference your Google Flight info on Skyscanner, Kayak, Trip, and Expedia (all the major competitors to Google Flights). While it doesn't always work, it's a free tool that will more than pay for itself if you ever end up booking a cheaper flight with it. Keep in mind that some flights might be cheaper because their layovers are longer.Use these online vacation package websitesThere are many websites that sell you travel packages that include flights, hotels, food, tours, and even transportation (rails, buses, taxis, etc.) for much cheaper than you would find if you tried to book each piece individually. The catch is that these packages are typically strict on dates, and their cancellation policies are often less forgiving. But you’ll be able to find amazing deals at locations you might not otherwise be able to afford. Gate1, for example, has been around since the '80s—my mom has used it with my dad to visit the eight wonders of the world on a budget over the years. Their best deals come from their weekly specials (you can sign up for their emails) and last-minute deals where you can find multi-day trips for big discounts. For example, you can do a 13-day Thailand trip for $2,249 with all this included:Roundtrip flights Los Angeles to Bangkok, or Bangkok to Los Angeles Intra-flight Chiang Mai to Bangkok11 nights First Class accommodationsHotel taxes, fees, service charges, and porterage18 meals: 11 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 4 dinnersSightseeing per itinerary in modern air-conditioned motor coachServices of English-speaking tour manager throughoutEntrance fees per itineraryHere are some other websites similar to Gate1 where you can find great deals on packages for your next trip:TravelPiratesGreat Value VacationsGoing (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights)\n            ",

That's not necessarily a bad thing, as far as I'm concerned. From where I'm sitting, many of us couldn't care less about the latest AI features companies are shoving into their products—we just want the products we actually use to work, and work well. But strictly focusing on AI progress, Apple is far behind rivals like Google and Microsoft. While Android and Windows are full of AI features, either through Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT models, Apple's first-party AI advances are much more limited. Both Google and Microsoft promote their AI assistants as a cornerstone of their marketing strategies; meanwhile, Apple pulled it AI Siri commercial, as its promised upgrades kept getting delayed.That's not to say there aren't any AI features here—far from it. Since iOS 18, Apple has rolled out AI features under the Apple Intelligence umbrella, including things like Image Playground, AI image editing, and Writing Tools. But, again, these features are not selling iPhones, and it seems like Apple knows it. The company appears to be doing more AI work behind the scenes than in front of it these days.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDespite all this, the company is still making serious in-roads with AI. In fact, the company is planning three key new AI features, at least according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.AI SiriRemember how I said Apple's AI Siri upgrade keeps getting delayed? Well, as it happens, AI Siri might be here sooner than later—at least, in part. According to Gurman, Apple plans to roll out \"a new Siri\" with iOS 26.4, while the assistant will get a \"redesign\" with next year's iOS 27. If you recall, Apple promised an AI-powered Siri with iOS 18 that was smarter than any iteration of Siri that had come before. This AI Siri was highly contextual, understanding what you meant in your requests without you needing to be hyper-specific. In addition, the assistant could pull information from a variety of sources, such as messages or emails, to fulfill requests, and even had an agent mode to take actions on your behalf. This is similar to how AI browsers let you ask the assistant to do things on the web for you. It's objectively futuristic, to be sure, but not necessarily useful—nor is it secure.As it happens, Apple had a lot of trouble actually getting those features to work. The company's new Siri is an extreme engineering puzzle that wasn't solved by iOS 18's release, and was delayed through iOS 26.0. If the schedule holds, those changes should be coming to 26.4, and may even be powered in part by Google's Gemini model. That said, iOS 26.4 is likely four months away: Apple just released iOS 26.1 and is beta testing iOS 26.2, and neither update comes with any Siri upgrades. Since the company released iOS 18.4 in March of this year, chances are we'll see 26.4 in March 2026. If so, we might only be a quarter year away from a new Siri experience. Next year, according to Gurman, Siri will get a total makeover. The assistant will be more conversational, and will power Apple's upcoming smart home device strategy. But that's a ways away yet.AI health agent Gurman says Apple is also working on an AI agent that can coach users on health-related issues. Codenamed \"Project Mulberry,\" the service combines a new Health app, subscription (Health+), and AI health assistant. This assistant can pull data from the Health app to inform its advice, and is being trained using real doctors across medical professions. According to Gurman, \"if the Health app receives data about poor heart-rate trends, a video explaining the risks of heart disease could appear.\"The company is actually opening studio space to record videos for this service, and may feature a \"major doctor personality\" to \"host\" this Health+ service. (My money's on Doctor Mike, but maybe that's the only major doctor personality I know.)Gurman says this AI health agent could arrive as soon as iOS 26.4, alongside the new AI Siri. It will be interesting to see how Apple squares two key problems with this feature: AI sometimes makes mistakes (and sometimes just makes things up), so trusting it to offer health advice raises some red flags. Add in the fact that Apple will be using user data to inform the AI on how to handle health advice, and user privacy questions pop up. The company prides itself on privacy, so I imagine it will have a clear plan here, but if this AI health agent really launches, these points will need to be addressed. Web search toolFinally, Gurman says that Apple has \"plans for an AI-powered web search tool.\" This tool is called \"World Knowledge Answers\" within the company, and is intended to compete against similar search tools from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity. World Knowledge Answers will integrate directly within Siri, and may come to Safari and Spotlight too. It may include text, images, videos, and \"local points of interest,\" as well as AI summaries. The idea is to keep users asking questions within Apple's own suite of products, rather than see them use other AI search tools. It's likely it'll arrive alongside these other two features with iOS 26.4.Will these AI features be enough to catch Apple up to the rest of the AI players? I'm not sure. But I'm not sure the company needs to catch up. As much as Microsoft has made AI a cornerstone of its new Windows experiences, it's not the reason people are buying PCs. Similarly, few users are choosing their smartphones, tablets, and computers based on whether Apple, Google, or Microsoft has the best AI assistant, or the best array of AI features. AI might be big money right now, but not in a way where Apple needs to be on top to remain one of the biggest companies in the world. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

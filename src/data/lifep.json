Early access was initially reserved to a waitlist of Perplexity Max users, a subscription that costs $200 per <em>month</em>, before Perplexity opened up access to Perplexity Pro users, who only need to pay $20 per month. Still, seeing as most web browsers are free to use, I imagine most people still shied away from trying Comet because of the price.</p><p>If that sounds like you, there's good news. On Friday, Perplexity made Comet available to anyone who wants to try it for free. You don't need to subscribe to any Perplexity plan, nor do you even need a Perplexity account—though the company has some features tied to those who sign in. Comet is built on Chromium, so if you're coming from Chrome, or another Chromium browser like Edge, you'll be able to jump right in. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Installing Comet is as easy as any other web browser: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">just head to Perplexity's website</a>, and choose \"Download Comet.\" Even setting up the browser feels familiar, as you can import another Chrome profile, choose a profile pic, and set a name. But of course, the real advertised advantage here is the AI assistant. Like other AI-powered browsers, Comet has a built-in chatbot you can talk to about whatever it is you want—particularly the web pages you happen to be browsing. But Comet's AI is agentic, which means you can ask the AI to do things for you. </p><p>If you ask it to take you to a specific website, it will (though I'm not sure that's any faster than simply typing in the site by hand). If you ask it to open a specific link on the page, you can see the bot take over the page, and choose the URL you asked for. For example, I asked the assistant to open Lifehacker, then asked it to click on our article \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-browse-the-dark-web\" target=\"_blank\">How to Browse the Dark Web</a>.\" It did both of these things, and even offered a summary of the dark web piece.  </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But Perplexity says you can also request more complex tasks: According to the company, the assistant can draft emails on your behalf, build websites, make purchases, create citations, add to your calendar. There's even a voice mode, as with other AI bots like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-is-out-now\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/gemini-live-is-now-available-to-all-android-users-for-free\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, so you can talk to the browser if you want to. </p><p>I'm still not sold on the idea that injecting agentic AI into my web browser is what I need to better experience the internet. Maybe I need to spend some time with Comet to experience that \"future.\" But seeing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+hallucination+lifehacker&udm=14\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">how often the tech still makes mistakes</a>—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/prompt-injection-attacks-ai-browsers\" target=\"_blank\">not the mention the untapped security risks</a>—I'm not sure I want to hand off all of my browsing tasks to AI just yet. Still, if you're interested, you can give it a go without spending a dime.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Apple can keep adding new features and designs with each new smartphone iteration, but if the company just announced a new iPhone with record-breaking battery life, customers would be thrilled. </p><p>While we may have to wait for a time when the iPhone can go a couple days in between charges, Apple has added a new option to iOS 26 in an effort to help extend your iPhone's battery life. The feature, Adaptive Power, uses on-device AI to analyze your iPhone usage and guess the times you'll need additional battery life. This is exactly how I want to see AI being used—not for generating <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-realistic videos</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/spotify-ai-music-policies\" target=\"_blank\">musical slop</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-adaptive-power-tries-to-boost-your-battery\">How Adaptive Power tries to boost your battery</h2><div><p>When Adaptive Power decides it's time to engage, the feature can adjust your iPhone's performance level. This will make some tasks take longer than they normally would, but that slower speed supposedly saves on battery life. In addition, Adaptive Power lowers screen brightness by 3%, limits background activity, and, when your iPhone reaches 20%, kicks on Low Power Mode without asking you first. </p><p>Apple isn't totally clear here about the difference between Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power in general. From what we know, it seems that Adaptive Power simply reduces processing speeds at select intervals, and only slightly lowers brightness, while Low Power Mode slows speeds and display refresh rate, and limits brightness, 5G, iCloud syncing, and mail fetch, among other tasks.  </p></div><p>Adaptive Power is enabled by default on Apple's newest iPhones, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air—the latter of which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">could most likely benefit from such a feature</a>. For all other compatible iPhones, which includes iPhone 15 Pro and newer, the feature is turned off by default. That means, unless you have an iPhone 17 device, you'll need to turn this on yourself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-turn-adaptive-power-on-or-off\">How to turn Adaptive Power on or off</h2><p>Whether you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 17, you'll find the controls for Adaptive Power in the same place. Open Settings, then head to <strong>Battery > Power Mode</strong>. Here, you can tap the toggle next to \"Adaptive Power\" to turn the setting on or off. </p><p>Since Adaptive Power turns on and off throughout the day, Apple also offers you the option to receive alerts whenever the feature is active. You can adjust this setting from the \"Adaptive Power Notifications\" toggle.</p><p>I've been using Adaptive Power since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26 dropped on Sept. 15</a>, but it's tough to say whether the feature has had a noticeable impact on my battery life. I think it would help if Apple added Adaptive Power information to my battery stats, so I could compare the impacts before and after using the feature. For now, I'll continue using it, if for no other reason than to offer my battery the best possible chance of making it through the day without its charger. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

The thing is, it actually matters quite a bit, especially if you care about charging speeds. But even knowing that, you might take a look at <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zJrY5p?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20newest%20power%20adapter&short_url=zJrY5p&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fapples-newest-iphone-charger-is-pretty-versatile&event_label=Apple%27s%20newest%20power%20adapter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Apple's newest power adapter</a> and think \"$40? Without a <em>cable</em>? No way.\" </p><p>It's certainly a steep price for a power adapter, especially as you can find other options for <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aeKLgw?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=literally%20half%20the%20price&short_url=aeKLgw&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fapples-newest-iphone-charger-is-pretty-versatile&event_label=literally%20half%20the%20price\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">literally half the price</a>. But there's something interesting about this particular charger. It might not necessarily be <em>worth</em> $40, but there's a reason it's not cheap: This thing might be the only power adapter you need in your tech tool box.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"dynamic-power-output\">Dynamic power output</h2><p>As you can see from the product listing, Apple's power adapter is advertised as a 40W charger. However, it is <em>also</em> advertised as being able to deliver up to 60W. You don't typically see that from a power adapter, as the wattage you see is the wattage you usually get. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/heres-what-makes-apples-new-40-watt-power-adapter-unique/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As CNET's Bridget Carey explains</a>, this is made possible through some clever engineering. The power adapter will start by offering the maximum charging output your device in question can take in, up to 60W. iPhones can't accept 60W of charging, for example, but MacBooks can: So this 40W power adapter can actually deliver 60W of power when connected to something like your MacBook—at first. Since the power adapter isn't actually a true 60W charger, it can't sustain that power output for long periods of time. As such, it pulls back the power draw over time. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>In practical terms, it means you can get an initial 60W charge on a device that can accept it, which can help charge your larger devices faster at the start. Rather than bring a power adapter for your iPhone, and a larger one for your MacBook, or tote a huge power adapter for both, you get a compact power adapter that can offer the best of both worlds.</p><p>There's also a reason Apple chose 40W for this power adapter's \"standard\" output. The new iPhone 17 series <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-i-will-probably-upgrade-to-base-iphone-17\" target=\"_blank\">has the quickest charging speeds of any iPhone device so far</a>, charging up to 50% in just 20 minutes. (The exception is the iPhone 17 Air, which can charge to 50% in 30 minutes.) However, you need the right power adapter to take advantage of these charging speeds—at least 40W. (Again, the iPhone 17 Air is the exception, as it can charge to 50% in 30 minutes with 20W or higher.)</p><p>That's really the perk of this dynamic power adapter. It's powerful enough to offer the fastest charging speeds for your iPhone 17, while also offering a power boost to give something like a MacBook a faster charge, at least for a little while. That being said, there are plenty of power adapter options out there, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QGrYwE?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=including%20ones%20that%20offer%20outputs%20in%20the%2060W%20range&short_url=QGrYwE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fapples-newest-iphone-charger-is-pretty-versatile&event_label=including%20ones%20that%20offer%20outputs%20in%20the%2060W%20range\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including ones that offer outputs in the 60W range</a>. No matter what power adapter you end up going with, just keep two things in mind: the maximum power output of the adapter itself, but also your charging cable. If your cable can't support the wattage, it doesn't matter how large the adapter is.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

announced</a> a whole new fleet of equipment devices and the addition of AI fitness coaching, all in an effort to usher in \"a new era of connective wellness.\" The upgraded Bikes and Treads will probably be the biggest news of the day, but I was interested in another development: the brand's new partnerships and acquisition, which are also aligned with that \"connective wellness\" goal. </p><p>The company deepened its partnership with Hyrox, partnered with two new companies, and acquired Breathwrk, all while also adding more depth to existing elements of \"human connection\" on its robust platform. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"peloton-acquired-breathwrk\">Peloton acquired Breathwrk</h2><p>Yesterday, I attended the press event announcing all the big Peloton news. For the most part, everything made sense. New devices, better software, and updated classes to go along with them seemed like logical steps for a leading at-home fitness company to take over a decade into its existence. But then a presenter mentioned that Peloton had \"acquired <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QOg36B?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Breathwrk&short_url=QOg36B&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-acquisitions-partnerships&event_label=Breathwrk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Breathwrk</a>.\" This, it turns out, is exactly what it sounds like: It's an app that guides the user through breathing exercises—like calming breaths, breathing for sleep, and breathing for energy—designed to \"unleash your peak mental and physical potential.\" </p><p>Earlier this year, Peloton execs <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-price-changes-letter-to-investors\" target=\"_blank\">hinted at price increases</a> for memberships and mentioned a plan to roll out more \"fitness and wellness experiences.\" To that end, I've noticed a lot more \"wellness,\" generally, in the app's offerings. Beyond the cardio and strength classes Peloton is known for, I've found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/why-i-like-pelotons-meditation-classes\" target=\"_blank\">meditation</a>, \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-reflection-rides\" target=\"_blank\">reflection rides</a>,\" and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-nutrition-recipe-content-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">nutritional content</a>. It's been obvious for a while that the company's aspirations are greater than dominating the exercise space; they want to go deeper on mental health, nutrition, and everything else that goes into being well-rounded and healthy. </p><p>Per Peloton, All Access and App+ members can now access Breathwrk's app by using their Peloton login credentials. Further integrations between the two will be \"coming soon.\" </p><h2 id=\"pelotons-new-partnerships\">Peloton's new partnerships</h2><p>Peloton also announced partnerships with the Hospital for Special Surgery and Respin Health. HSS is a leader in orthopedics and rheumatology. Together, the two will \"produce programming focused on musculoskeletal injury prevention and recovery.\" That's all expected to start rolling out in the next few weeks. It's another bit of news that makes sense. In announcing the addition of an AI coach to personalize every member's workout plan, Peloton's reps pointed out that the software will use users' goals and existing workout data to outline what they should do for the next week—including when they should take rests. While ramping up wellness initiatives, Peloton hasn't overlooked the role rest plays in overall health. I'm interested to see what the HHS programming looks like in practice. </p><p>Respin is a platfor, launched by Halle Berry for those going through everything from perimenopause to postmenopause. The two brands will co-create an eight-week program of Peloton classes to specifically target symptom relief and various improvements for members going through those life changes. Again, these are coming in the next few weeks. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Finally, Peloton is doubling down on <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-hyrox-training-classes\" target=\"_blank\">its partnership with Hyrox</a>. That isn't a <em>new</em> partnership, but it's one that has apparently been fruitful enough to warrant the allocation of more resources. If you don't know, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-hyrox-fitness-competition\" target=\"_blank\">Hyrox is a relatively new sport</a> that involves running plus competing in things like sled pulls and pushes, among other exercises. You have to row, do burpees, and do a farmer's carry, too, all in the name of demonstrating how versatile you are as an athlete. Peloton has had a special Hyrox training program in place for a few months now, but plans to expand its offerings with new branded classes that support training for the various parts of the race. </p><h2 id=\"improvements-to-human-connections\">Improvements to \"human connections\"</h2><p>Peloton is also expanding what users can do with its existing offerings aimed at \"human connections.\" Primarily, this involves the addition of Club Peloton and Official Peloton Teams. </p><p>Club Peloton is a recognition program that awards users a rank based on how consistently they work out and whether they try new types of exercises. If you check your Peloton app right now, you might find you've already been assigned a rank, like bronze, silver, gold, or legendary. The idea is that your rank will eventually earn you rewards, like discounts on products or early access to classes. You'll also get a profile badge which will be visible to others when you're on a class leaderboard. </p><p>Official Peloton Teams is an expansion of Peloton's popular <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">Teams feature, which I already love</a>. With Teams, you join forces with friends and compete with or against them to hit certain goals, like a particular amount of workouts per week. You can also join Teams based on attributes like life stage (like being a new mom) or region (like the city where you live). Official Peloton Teams are the newest part of all that and are helmed by the company's famous instructors. You can join ones like Move for Life, Cross Training, Hyrox training, and Menopause Health. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

finally answered my biggest (yet perhaps pettiest) complaint about its iconic smart ring—it’s now getting a battery-powered charging case so you can top up the battery when you’re away from your home. There are also new ring colors available, and finally, multi-ring support so you can switch between rings.</p><p>In addition, Oura has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251001647209/en/URA-Debuts-Groundbreaking-Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-in-Striking-New-Colors\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>announced</u></a> Health Panels, a feature that lets you book a blood draw at a Quest lab and view your results in the Oura app. Whoop <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-new-blood-testing-feature\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recently announced a similar feature</u></a>, and Ultrahuman launched its <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aBDqx8?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Blood%20Vision&short_url=aBDqx8&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=Blood%20Vision\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Blood Vision</u></a> earlier this year. </p><h2 id=\"why-im-excited-for-the-charging-case\">Why I’m excited for the charging case</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-ive-learned-from-four-years-of-tracking-my-health-with-the-oura-ring\" target=\"_blank\"><u>all the time that I’ve been using Oura rings</u></a>—since generation 2—the charger has worked the same way: You have a little circular stand that lives on your nightstand, and you set the ring on top of it, fitting it around a little cylinder shape that sticks up from the base. I’ve never loved this format; it’s too easy to send the ring flying if you catch your foot on the cord in the dark. It’s also not the most convenient for travel. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Now, however, the Oura ring has a charging <em>case</em>. The case holds about five charges’ worth of battery, so you can top up the charge on your ring by popping it into the case, then closing the case and sticking it in your pocket. Or gym bag. (Weightlifting workouts are my favorite time to charge the ring.) Traveling with the charger is now simple, and you don’t have to worry about losing the ring if the charger gets knocked over. </p><p>Now for the bad news: This puppy is $99, and it’s a separate add-on; you can’t get it in place of the nightstand charger when buying a new ring.</p><p>Like the nightstand chargers, it’s specific to the size of your ring. For example, you need a size 8 charger for a size 8 ring. The new charging case doesn’t seem to be available on Oura’s website yet, but it should be coming soon. (If you can’t wait, or want to save a few bucks, I found this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4lEo?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=third-party%20case%20that%20holds%20your%20nightstand%20charger&short_url=Qp4lEo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=third-party%20case%20that%20holds%20your%20nightstand%20charger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>third-party case that holds your nightstand charger</u></a>—either generation 3 or 4. It's not as sleek as the official one, though.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-now-swap-between-rings\">You can now swap between rings</h2><p>Today Oura announced a <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aRMGe7?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=new%20collection%20of%20ceramic%20rings&short_url=aRMGe7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=new%20collection%20of%20ceramic%20rings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>new collection of ceramic rings</u></a> in four different colors: white, navy, pastel green, and pink. The new rings have the same internals as the metallic Ring 4, so this isn’t a new generation of ring, just a new appearance. (Oura also notes that the ceramic rings should be more resistant to scratches, and each one comes with a polishing pad to keep its shine.) All colors are $499, the same price as the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWERb7?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=gold%20and%20rose%20gold%20finishes&short_url=QWERb7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=gold%20and%20rose%20gold%20finishes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>gold and rose gold finishes</u></a> of the regular Ring 4.</p><p>With so many color options, Oura seems to hope existing members will splurge on a second ring. The company is rolling out multi-ring support for the app, another feature I'm surprised they didn’t have before. (When I’ve tested the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-oura-4-vs-oura-3\" target=\"_blank\">gen 3 and 4 rings to compare</a>, I've had to completely reset my ring to switch over, or else use two different accounts.) Oura says you’ll need to select in the app which one you’re wearing, so it’s not quite as seamless as the way Garmin or Apple handles multiple devices. (Garmin has me choose a “priority device” and then I can switch at will; Apple just sets you free to swap as you like, and it does its best). </p><p>If you are done with your old ring after upgrading, Oura now has a <a href=\"https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/44414370533139-Device-Recycling-Program\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>ring recycling service</u></a> that gives you a shipping label to send back your old ring. Any Oura ring can be recycled through this program, including old or broken ones. (You should factory-reset the ring first.) Rings you recycle won’t be eligible for returns or refunds.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

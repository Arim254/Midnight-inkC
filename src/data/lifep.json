The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

By choosing to engage with the digital world, you often must give up your anonymity: trackers watch your every move as your surf the web and scroll on social media sites, and they use that information to build profiles of who (and where) you are and deliver you more \"relevant\" ads.It doesn't have to be this way. There are a number of tactics that can help keep your browsing private. You can use a VPN to make it look like your internet activity is coming from somewhere else; if you use Safari, you can take advantage of Private Relay to hide your IP address from websites you visit; or, you can connect the internet across a different network altogether: Tor.What is Tor?The whole idea behind Tor (which is short for The Onion Router) is to anonymize your internet browsing so that no one can tell that it is you visiting any particular website. Tor started out as a project of the U.S. Naval Research Lab in the 1990s, but developed into a nonprofit organization in 2006. Ever since, the network has been popular with users who want to privatize their web activity, whether they're citizens of countries with strict censorship laws, journalists working on sensitive stories, or simply privacy-focused individuals.\nTor is a network, but it's commonly conflated with the project's official browser, also known as Tor. The Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox that connects to the Tor network. The browser removes many of the technical barriers to entry for the Tor network: You can still visit your desired URLs as you would in Chrome or Edge, but the browser will connect you to them automatically via the Tor network automatically. But what does that mean?How does Tor work?Traditionally, when you visit a website, your data is sent directly to that site, complete with your identifying information (i.e. your device's IP address). That website, your internet service provider, and any other entities that might be privy to your internet traffic can all see that it is your device making the request, and can collect that information accordingly. This can be as innocent as the website in question storing your details for your next visit, or as scummy as the site following you around the internet.Tor flips the script on this internet browsing model. Rather than connect your device directly to the website you're visiting, Tor runs your connection through a number of different servers, known as \"nodes.\" These nodes are hosted by volunteers all over the world, so there's no telling which nodes your request will go through when you initiate a connection.But Tor would not be known for its privacy if it only relied on multiple nodes to bounce your traffic around. In addition to the nodes, Tor adds layers of encryption your request. When the request passes from one node to another, each node is only able to decrypt one layer of the encryption, just enough to learn where to send the next request to. This method ensures that no one node in the system knows too much: Each only knows where the request came from one step before, and where it is sending the request to in the following step. It's like peeling back layers of an onion, hence the platform's name. Here's a simplified example of how it works: Let's say you want to visit Lifehacker.com through Tor. You initiate the request as you normally would, by typing the URL into Tor's address bar and hitting enter. When you do, Tor adds layered encryption to your request. The first node it sends it to, perhaps based in, say, the U.S., can unlock one layer of that encryption, which tells the node which node to send it to next. The next node, based perhaps in Japan, decrypts another layer of that encryption, which tells it to send it to a third node in Germany. That third node (known as the exit node) decrypts the final layer of encryption, which tells the node to connect to Lifehacker.com. Once Lifehacker receives the request, the reverse happens: Lifehacker sends the request to the node in Germany, which adds back its layer of encryption. It then sends it back to the node in Japan, which adds a second layer of encryption. It sends it back to the node in the U.S., which adds the final layer of encryption, before sending the fully encrypted request back to your browser, which can decrypt the entire request on your behalf. Congratulations: You have just visited Lifehacker.com, without revealing your identity. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTor isn't perfect for privacyWhile Tor goes a long way to anonymizing your internet activity, it won't protect you entirely. One of the network's biggest weaknesses is in the exit node: Since the final node in the chain carries the decrypted request, it can see where you're going, and, potentially, what you're doing when you get there. It won't be able to know where the request originated, but it can see that you're trying to access Lifehacker. Depending on what sites you're accessing, you might give enough information away to reveal yourself.  This was especially an issue when websites were largely using the unencrypted HTTP protocol. If you connected to an unencrypted website, that final node might be able to see your activity on the site itself, including login information, messages, or financial data. But now that most sites have switched to the encrypted HTTPS protocol, there's less concern with third-parties being able to access the contents of your traffic. Still, even if trackers can't see exactly what you're doing or saying on these sites, they can see you visited the site itself, which is why Tor is still useful in today's encrypted internet.  Who should use Tor?If you've heard anything about Tor, you might know it as the go-to service for accessing the dark web. That is true, but that doesn't make Tor bad. The dark web is not inherently bad, either: It's simply a network of sites that cannot be accessed by standard web browsers. That includes a number of very bad sites filled with very bad stuff, to be sure. But it also encompasses a number of perfectly legal activities as well. Chrome or Firefox cannot see dark web sites, but Tor browser can. But you don't need to visit the dark web in order for Tor to be useful. Anyone who wants to keep their internet traffic private from the world can benefit. You might have a serious need for this, such as if you live in a country that won't let you access certain websites, or if you're a reporter working on a story that could have ramifications should the information leak. But you don't need to have a specialized case to benefit. Tor can help reduce anyone's digital footprint, and keep trackers from following you around the internet.One big drawbackIf you do decide to use Tor, understand that it won't be as fast as other modern browsers. Running your traffic through multiple international nodes takes a toll on performance, so you may be waiting a bit longer for your websites to load than you're used to. However, it won't cost you anything to try it, as the browser is completely free to download and use on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Android. (Sorry, iOS fans.) If you're worried about what you've heard about the dark web, don't be: The only way to access that material it is to seek it out directly. Otherwise, using Tor will feel just like using any other browser—albeit just a tad slower. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The Wonderboom is their smaller, more portable version. The Wonderboom 4 released last summer, and dropped in price 40% during Cyber Monday, but you can still get it for $59.99 (originally $99.99) right now. This is the lowest price it has reached according to price-tracking tools, and it's cheaper than the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 3.\nThe Wonderboom 4 is a slight improvement on an already good portable rugged speaker, the Wonderboom 3. It is small enough to fit in most people's hands, and it is rated IP67 for water- and dust-proofing. The 14-hour battery life completes the trifecta of what you expect on a decent portable speaker. This new version comes with USB-C for faster charging, and a Podcast mode, which tweaks the EQ to suit spoken vocals. Unfortunately, there is no full EQ customization or support with the Ultimate Ears app.The sound is where most Ultimate Ears speakers shine, using their 360-degree sound, great for group listening. Like the Podcast mode, there is also an Outdoor mode which makes the EQ sound better at higher volumes so you can listen to it outdoors in noisy environments. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs an outdoor speaker or for someone who likes to listen to podcasts or audiobooks at home without headphones, the Wonderboom 4 is great, especially at its current $59.99 price. There aren't many outdoor speakers at this price tag that can compete with it, other than the JBL Clip 5, which is currently at the same price.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The sale ends after Cyber Monday. Once you've purchased, the redemption code and setup instructions will be sent to your inbox. Just make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (like a 1GHz processor, 4GB RAM, TPM 2.0, and UEFI firmware, among others). This isn’t an upgrade path for unsupported PCs—it’s a fresh install for machines that meet the full list of Windows 11 Pro requirements.The Windows 11 Pro layout is cleaner, Snap Layouts and virtual desktops make multitasking smoother, and redocking windows actually works like you'd expect. If you’re into voice typing or just want better search across apps and docs, it delivers. Windows 11 Pro also includes some solid professional tools, such as BitLocker for encryption, Hyper-V for virtualization, and even a sandbox mode for testing apps safely. You’re also getting DirectX 12 Ultimate, so your hardware can shine during gaming or graphics-intensive tasks, assuming your machine is sufficiently powerful.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWindows 11 Pro also doubles down with biometric login, Smart App Control, and TPM 2.0 requirements, which makes it a tougher nut to crack. It also includes the new AI-powered Copilot and baked-in Microsoft Teams support, which might appeal to remote workers. Just a heads up, you won’t get an Office upgrade bundled in with this deal—this is strictly a Windows license. It will work alongside Office if you have a separate license, though (if you’re on a Mac using Parallels Pro). Overall, this $10 deal is about as straightforward and affordable as it gets.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Other times, I'm overcome with the sudden desire to wallpaper the kitchen. I am constantly in a state of decorating, cleaning, rearranging, and generally improving. Lately, that's involved a lot of tech and appliance upgrades to make my environment better and more serviceable, not just nice to look at. One of the best things I've gotten my hands on is the Shark TurboBlade Cool + Heat, which is both a heater and a fan. I'm picky about both because I always want to be warmer and need a heater, but I also like the noise of a fan at night to fall asleep (while I'm safe from the cool air under my blanket). Having both in one has been awesome and, now that the device is $150 off for Black Friday, you should consider getting one, too. \nFirst of all, I always want to be upfront when I've been given something by a company so I can review it. That's what happened here. I don't write a nice review if something stinks, though, so here I am, saying this thing is extremely useful. Typically, the TurboBlade Cool + Heat is $400. That's a lot, although it makes economic sense if you don't want to spend a bunch of money on a good fan and a good heater separately. It also makes sense for someone like me in a little apartment. It's frustrating to have to store two large devices when I could just have one. Still, the discount, which puts this at $250 for the shopping holiday, is much appreciated. The fanThe TurboBlade Cool + Heat is bladeless and modern-looking, which I like. It's also powerful. You can adjust it up to 10 levels of air-blasting, so you can get just a touch or a whole wind storm. I opt for a level-10 wind storm because I am especially interested in white noise at bedtime, but it comes with a convenient little remote so if it gets too loud or too airy, I don't have to get up to adjust it. The heat option, which is easy to toggle on, has three modes. There's a filter at the bottom that looks easy to clean, but I haven't had to do that yet. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: SharkNinja/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nYou can turn the vents horizontally or vertically, plus it can tilt and oscillate on its own. If you're going to pay a few hundred bucks for something, it should do a few cool tricks, and this does. You can also dim the control panel, which I do because I like to sleep in pitch darkness. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome tech specs: It has 1,400 watts, its air flow capacity is 1,180 cubic feet per minute, and its top speed is 10 RPM. It has a 120 voltage and weighs a little over 21 pounds. I am a simple person, so I don't pay attention to any of those things except the weight. It doesn't come put-together, so I foolishly assembled it in the middle of my entryway (which was perfectly easy to do and took me maybe five minutes), then had to haul it around, assembled and heavy, to place it where I wanted it. Is 21 pounds a ton of weight? No, but it was tricky for me to push it up the ladder into my lofted bedroom and I do wish I had assembled it in the room where I planned to use it. Just a word of advice. What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

I've rounded up the best tech deals you can find right now and will continue to do so throughout the sale.The best earphones and headphones on sale for Cyber MondayThe new 2nd Gen. Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds came out this August, and are great earbuds (I'm wearing them as I write this). They're one of the best earbuds of 2025, and they're $50 off.

Not bad for a QLED.The best deal on Cyber Monday tabletsFor those with a little more budget and looking for better features and specs for a better budget tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11\" Tablet is Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11\" Tablet is $199.99 (originally $269.99).The best portable speakers deals for Cyber MondayThe JBL Charge 6 is a powerful yet portable speaker that came out this year. Its sound is powerful enough to completely fill up a big room with a full sound and maintain its sound quality while doing so.

However, if you can spare the $20, the Charge 6 offers a better value.There are good deals on laptops. With some powerful ones starting in the $400s, your money will go a longer way if you get something with at least 16GB of RAM and at least an Intel or Ryzen 5 processor. One example is the HP Essential 255 G10, with a Ryzen 5 processor and 16GB of RAM for $459 (originally $918).If you can spare close to another $100, the HP 255 G10 is with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, is $568.99 (originally $1,137.99). An incredible value for your money. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat other sales will Target have for Cyber Monday?Target says it will have week-long deals every Sunday through Dec. 24.

The Fitbit Google Ace LTE leans fully into that balance, and this price drop to $99.95 from $179.95—its lowest ever, according to price trackers—makes it easier to consider.\n Fitbit has been in the “make healthy habits fun” business for years, and Google’s influence shows in how polished the Ace LTE feels. The watch uses animated creatures and simple games to nudge kids between seven and 11 toward movement. The catch—which is the whole point—is that you can’t sit and play uninterrupted. Every few minutes, the watch asks for a bit of movement, like hitting a step goal, before the game continues. For a lot of parents, that structure helps turn the watch into a tool that encourages activity rather than another screen to fight over.Where the device becomes more than just a toy is in the built-in LTE GPS tracking. The watch can send and receive calls and texts, and you can see your child’s location through the companion Fitbit Ace app, which you install on your phone. It works with both iOS and Android, and the parental controls cover the basics, including contact management. There are limits, though. The Ace LTE doesn’t support music apps or sleep tracking, and this PCMag review notes that there’s occasional sluggishness when swapping between features. Still, the hardware itself feels sturdy, and the screen is easy for kids to navigate.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, the software is clearly built around the subscription model. And that subscription is the real consideration here. The watch requires a $9.99 monthly Ace Pass for GPS location tracking, LTE features, and access to the games—an ongoing cost you have to factor into the decision. Without the subscription, the watch becomes a basic step counter, and if it’s only doing that, you might as well get the older Fitbit Ace 3. Still, for families who want reliable location tracking and a structured way to encourage daily movement, the Ace LTE offers both in a kid-friendly package.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It's the best non-Ultra smartwatch for your iPhone and, in my experience, its fitness-related features are excellent. This Cyber Monday deal brings the Series 11 down to $329 (18% off), which is an excellent price for a brand new Apple Watch.\nThe Series 11 is available in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm; and two variants: GPS, and GPS+Cellular. At time of writing, the best deal is on the 42mm GPS variant. All other variants are more lightly discounted, but be aware that your favorite color may not be discounted during this Cyber Monday 2025 sale.The key to finding great Apple deals is to buy from third-party retailers, and that's true for this Apple Watch Series 11 deal as well. Amazon's Cyber Monday 2025 sales have it cheapest right now.Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt said she loves the Apple Watch Series 11, but admittedly, she doesn't recommend it to those who already have a Series 10. If you have an Apple Watch that's a few years old, the Series 11 is worth buying, but it's hasn't taken a big enough leap ahead to justify annual upgrades.The Series 11 is thin, light, and plenty comfortable to wear all day. It has support for hypertension notifications, ECG recording, built-in GPS for tracking outdoor workouts, and an Ion-X display that's more scratch resistant than that of older Apple Watch models. It also has improved battery life compared to the Series 10.While it's common knowledge at this point, I still think it's worth mentioning that the Apple Watch only works with iPhones. You can't even pair it with an iPad or a Mac, so this device is only for iPhone users. If that sounds like you, this is a great opportunity for an upgrade.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Cyber Monday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog.Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It’s now down to $139.99 from $219.99, which is its lowest price ever, according to price trackers.\n The draw here is the extensive coverage the dual-camera setup provides. One lens gives you a wide 130-degree 3K view of your yard, while the other zooms in far enough to pick up small details you’d usually miss, like a package label or a license plate. Both sit on a motorized mount that pans 360 degrees and tilts 120 degrees, so you can follow activity across your property without repositioning the fixture. As PCMag noted in its “outstanding” review, the E340 functions more like a compact surveillance system than a standard floodlight cam.The LEDs emit 2,000 lumens at a neutral 4,000K tone, providing sufficient lighting to light up a yard but not harsh enough to wash out details. The IP65 housing sits comfortably outdoors, and the setup holds its connection well with dual-band wifi. Night vision is clean, and the color feed looks better when the lights kick on. Storage is flexible, though not plug-and-play. You get a microSD slot that supports cards up to 128GB, but you’ll need to bring your own microSD card since none is included. That size covers days of continuous recording or far longer if you stick to motion-triggered clips. If you want more space, Eufy’s HomeBase S380 expands recording to 16TB, or you can skip hardware entirely and add a cloud service for as little as $3.99 per month.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe app makes day-to-day use manageable with controls for panning, tilting, zooming, saved presets, and simple toggles for lights, two-way audio, or the 100dB siren. That said, while the E340 works with Alexa and Google Assistant, it does not support Apple HomeKit or IFTTT, so anyone tied into those platforms may feel boxed out. The wired installation also means you either need to be comfortable with electrical work or pay someone who is. But once installed, the performance holds steady. Our reviewer says the E340 is worth the money. At this price, anyone interested in combining bright outdoor lighting with reliable surveillance will likely feel the same.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

That’s a steep drop from its original price for what is still a current and capable machine. With an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, and Apple’s M2 chip inside, this MacBook handles most day-to-day tasks with ease. Web browsing, photo editing, app switching, and light video work all feel smooth and quick, and the 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display is bright at 500 nits, supports a wide P3 color gamut, and offers sharp resolution at 2880x1864. If you’ve been using a smaller screen or an older laptop, the difference is noticeable.The M2 MacBook Air offers up to 18 hours of battery life for video playback or 15 hours for web use, so it’s built for long stretches without needing a charger, though your mileage may vary depending on use. The port selection includes MagSafe 3 for charging and two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, which cover most use cases but does mean you'll likely need adapters for more complex setups. The six-speaker system is surprisingly full for a laptop this size and supports Spatial Audio, which pairs well with the 1080p FaceTime camera and three-mic array for video calls. Bluetooth 5.3 and wifi 6 round out the connectivity, keeping everything modern. And while the 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD will suit general use, creatives or heavier users might prefer upgrading to the 512GB, 1TB, or even 2TB configurations, which are also discounted on StackSocial at the moment.Since it’s a pre-owned device, this unit comes with a Grade A refurbished rating, which means you’re getting something that may (or may not) have a few tiny scuffs, but nothing that affects performance. It also includes a 30-day parts and labor warranty, just in case. You won’t get macOS preinstalled in every case, but the device can be updated to the latest macOS Tahoe 26. If you want a larger MacBook with modern power but don’t want to spend over $1,000, this is one of the more balanced deals you’ll find, especially considering it’s less than half the price of a new 15-inch MacBook Pro.How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Right now, the hair-styling device is at its lowest price ever, according to price trackers—$499.99, down from the usual $649.99.Even with the discount, it’s still very much a premium splurge, but the appeal of the Airwrap starts to make sense once you actually use it. This is not a simple blow-dryer: It is a multi-styler built around airflow rather than extreme heat, which matters if you style often and want to avoid frying your hair in the process. For some buyers, that alone justifies the cost, especially if they have thick or color-treated hair that reacts badly to heat plates.The Airwrap i.d. builds on Dyson’s standard attachments and adds Bluetooth pairing through the MyDyson app, which may seem like a strange match for a hair tool. But in practice, it comes in handy when you’re figuring out what works for you by letting you save styling preferences by hair type, length, and texture. The app also offers step-by-step styling guides and recommends attachments based on your desired look. Compared with the standard Airwrap, the i.d. stands out mostly for this personalization. Where the tool falls short is the same place older versions do. It is still expensive, even with this discount, and travel cases or extra attachments raise that cost.The kit includes six attachments: a smoothing dryer, two curling barrels (for each direction), a round volumizing brush, and two paddle brushes. It also dries and styles at the same time, which cuts down the usual back and forth with multiple tools. That said, the learning curve is real, especially if you’re used to traditional curlers. The results depend a lot on your hair texture and patience, and not everyone ends up with salon-level curls in the first week. Still, for anyone seeking gentler, customizable hair styling, this deal on the Airwrap i.d. is one of the more meaningful price drops of the season.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you.

The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

And right now, the usually-pricey Samsung 75-Inch The Frame Pro is on sale for $1,997.99 (originally $2,997.99) this Black Friday, marking its lowest price ever. While the other sizes are also discounted by 33%, this TV offers the biggest savings for the largest size, making it the best overall value.\nWith its generous screen size, this QLED TV delivers a cinematic experience and doubles as a visual conversation piece. Its 4K resolution and NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor ensure bright, sharp images with reliable color accuracy, and it supports gaming speeds of up to 144Hz. Smart features allow you to stream directly and easily connect consoles and other devices. Another perk is its Wireless One Connect box, which contains four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector. It wirelessly streams audio and video to the TV, meaning you only need to hide a single cable rather than a tangle of obvious cords and devices. However, this also could introduce undesirable latency for gamers.The main draw is Art Mode: when you’re not watching TV, it transforms into a framed piece of art with customizable bezels, made even more realistic by a matte, anti-glare finish. You can purchase art through the Samsung Art Store for $4.99 a month or $49.99 a year, or buy high-res art from Etsy vendors and museum or archive sites and load it onto a USB. PCMag notes that while the matte screen, dual functionality, and color performance are all excellent, black levels are less impressive, and contrast is somewhat mediocre.If your priority is a TV that performs well for everyday viewing while doubling as a digital picture frame to elevate your interior design, the Samsung 75-Inch The Frame Pro is a great choice, especially at its current discount. However, it may not be ideal if you’re looking for an ultra-bright picture with deeper contrast or a display optimized for gaming.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday or Cyber MondayWhen you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ \"Black Friday\" or \"Cyber Monday\" tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it's the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, impulse buyers may not fully realize what they're buying.How to tell if a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.To avoid a low-key scam, do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time.

I grew out of using my iPhone and Mac to read ebooks a few years ago, but I waited until this year to finally grab the e-reader I'd been eyeing since 2020. It's the Kindle Paperwhite, which I bought on discount a few months ago. I love it, which is why I'm happy to report that it's now on sale for Cyber Monday and is down to its lowest ever price.I know what you might be about to say, but buying a Kindle doesn't mean that you're forced to opt into Amazon's ebook ecosystem. I've successfully de-Amazoned my Kindle, and it's been going fine so far. You have lots of Amazon alternatives to buy ebooks, and I've made the most of the opportunity to read many of the DRM-free ebooks purchased over the years. The Kindle Paperwhite itself is a great device, too. It's quite snappy and doesn't show any performance issues even if you turn a lot of pages back-to-back.It's water-resistant, which means that you can use it by the pool, beach, or even while doing the dishes. And yes, there was a time when I got so locked into a book that I actually was reading the series even while doing the dishes. It was a bit annoying to stop and turn the page every minute or so, but the point is that I never worried about causing any water damage to my Kindle Paperwhite.Yes, there is a cheaper Kindle, too, but it lacks water resistance and has about half the battery life of a Paperwhite, which makes it less appealing to me. If you can afford to do so, I think buying the Kindle Paperwhite is the smart choice. But there still are a few more decisions to factor in. One is the color. The Paperwhite is available in black, green, and pink colors and all are currently at their lowest ever price. Once you've figured out your color, you need to choose if you're buying your Kindle with ads or ad-free. I always recommend spending the extra 20 bucks to get the ad-free version, but if lock screen ads don't bother you, then you can get the lower priced model.The third and final choice is whether you want to stretch your budget for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. This variant has 32GB of built-in storage (double that of the regular Paperwhite), an auto-adjusting front light, and support for wireless charging. It's just $5 more than the ad-free Kindle Paperwhite at time of writing, and it's worth remembering that this variant also doesn't have ads. Personally, I think the choice is really between an ad-supported Paperwhite at $125 or an ad-free Paperwhite Signature Edition at $150. Both are great devices, so no matter what, you can't really go wrong.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The sale runs though Cyber Monday, and it's a one-time payment for lifetime access. Once you buy, the redemption code gets emailed to you instantly, and you have 30 days to activate it. There are no recurring fees, just a fully loaded development environment with features that make coding faster, cleaner, and less of a headache.This version of Visual Studio marks a shift—it’s their first 64-bit IDE that handles larger projects without choking. If you’ve ever waited for your code editor to stop freezing while dealing with massive workloads, that’s less of a concern here. It supports cross-platform app development through .NET MAUI, so you're covered whether you’re building for Android, iOS, or desktop. Plus, features like Live Share make collaboration more streamlined. You can co-code in real time, control what collaborators see, and even carry over your custom settings. There’s also IntelliCode, which is basically AI that learns your coding habits and fills in the blanks intelligently. It can finish lines of code or suggest the next logical move based on your style and context. It’s a little eerie, but it works. You can also build, test, and deploy to Azure right from the IDE, which is great if you’re cloud-focused.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are some things to keep in mind. This is for Windows users only. If you’re working on a Chromebook, iPad, or even a 32-bit system—this won’t work. It’s compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and you’ll need at least 4GB of RAM (though more is better). Depending on the number of features you install, it also requires storage space ranging from 850MB to 210 GB. For just $10 for Microsoft Visual Studio, this is a great steal and worth trying out. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

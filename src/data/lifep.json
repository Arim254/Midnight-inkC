The statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.That surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\nGoogle can afford to hold off on adsWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.Does this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.The divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Despite losing out to other search engine and email companies like Google, Yahoo! is very much still a thing. In fact, one statistic claims Yahoo! Mail still has 225 million daily active users to this day. That's a ways off from Gmail's 1.8 billion daily active users, but way better than AOL's eight million users. (Yes, AOL is still a thing, and is actually a part of Yahoo!—at least until its sale to Bending Spoons goes through).But I'm not here to talk about Yahoo! and AOL's marketshare. Instead, I'm here to sound the alarms to the millions of people that use Yahoo!, and, by extension, AOL: The services were down this morning. If you tried to search the web for something on Yahoo!, or check your Yahoo! Mail, or even your AOL Mail, you'd find the following error message: \"Edge: Too Many Requests.\" I first spotted the outage via Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which had tens of thousands of user reports, before falling off by 10:30 a.m. ET. Since then, the sites are back online.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's no official reason for the outage from Yahoo! as of this article, but, like most of these outages, the company resolved the issues fairly quickly. Last week, X had an outage, and it came back online before long. Of course, that outage was overshadowed by the massive Verizon outage, which Verizon claimed was simply a \"software issue.\" There's a big difference between a series of web sites going down and a nationwide cell network, however, so it's not surprising Yahoo! and AOL alike were both back online this morning. The millions of users who rely on these services now have them back, while the rest of us can forget about them all over again.  \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.How age prediction for ChatGPT worksOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.Here's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\nWhat's restricted in the \"safer\" version of ChatGPTThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:Graphic violence or goreViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"Role play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in natureSelf-harm descriptionsContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming The company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.AI isn't always great at age predictionThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.That doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.I don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.Verizon credit phishing scamAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website. If you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it. \nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For nearly all of Wednesday, roughly two million Verizon customers could not connect to the network, and had to rely on wifi to use their smartphones, which were otherwise stuck in SOS mode. Sure, they could call 911, but they couldn't do much else. It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.The weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one. \nA software issue caused the Verizon outage, not a cyber attackAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details.

That was due to Verizon's nationwide outage, which affected roughly two million customers across the United States. If you were among them, you couldn't use your phone on the go, which is sort of the idea behind cellphones in general. This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send work emails or messages, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or perhaps because of it), the company seems keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced it had resolved the outage, it also said it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowVerizon made a post on X, once again apologizing for the outage and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive. If you're among them, Verizon says they will text you when the credit is available. When it is, you can log into the myVerizon app to claim your recompense.        \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The music streaming service is sending emails to customers letting them know about yet another price hike coming next month.To Spotify's credit, the price hike is pretty minor. But starting on whatever your February billing date is, individual premium plans will jump from $11.99/month to $12.99/month, while student plans will go from $5.99/month to $6.99/month. More extensive plans will see a slightly more costly jump. The Duo plan, which gives premium access to two people at the same address, is going from $16.99/month to $18.99/month. The Family plan, which gives premium access to up to six people at the same address, will also see a $2 increase, now costing $21.99/month rather than $19.99/month.\nThe price hikes are set to affect the U.S., Estonia, and Latvia, according to Spotify's announcement. The company's rationale for all this? According to the post, \"occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers.\"Truthfully, $1 to $2 does seem like a pretty minor change, but the update follows another U.S. price hike in 2024, where Individual plans went up by $1, Duo plans went up by $2, and Family plans went up by $3. And that came after a price hike in 2023, where the Individual, Student, and Family plans went up by $1, while the Duo plan went up by $2. Certain subscribers outside of the U.S. also saw their own price increases in 2025. I can't help but feel like a frog in a slowly boiling pot.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe continual barrage of price hikes is a bit of a disappointment for subscribers who had gotten used to a steady price for Spotify since its U.S. launch in 2011, as the service went for 12 years before its first price change. If all these price hikes are starting to get to you, you might be able to get around them. If you can find one at a store near you, you can pay upfront for a discounted annual subscription using a Spotify gift card, although it won't apply to Spotify's Family or Student plans. Unfortunately, Spotify does not have an annual subscription plan available on its website.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

They're also often low quality, AI-generated, misinformation, or some combination of the bunch, and may have a negative impact on our attention spans and mental health. In short, they're just not that good for us. It's bad enough for grown adults to control their scrolling habits, but it's another thing entirely for children, which poses quite the a challenge.It's easy enough to ban short-form video apps entirely, like TikTok. But what about apps that have short-form content as just one pillar of the overall package? Take YouTube: You might not mind your child having limited access to the app or site to watch long-form content you approve of, but having Shorts always in the way throws a wrench in that system. Any type of short-form video feed would be an issue here, but YouTube Shorts is particularly egregious, allowing kids to watch some truly horrific content, often generated by AI. Choosing whether your kids watch YouTube ShortsLuckily, YouTube finally appears to be giving parents some control here. As spotted by TechCrunch, YouTube announced updates to its parental controls on Wednesday. While there are a few changes on the way, the headline for me concerns Shorts. Not only will YouTube let parents choose a timer for how often their kids can watch Shorts, they can choose to set the timer to zero—effectively blocking Shorts for their kids' and teens' accounts. \nThis should be welcome news to any parents struggling to limit the short-form video content their kids are watching. You can let them watch other types of videos on YouTube Kids, or even standard YouTube if its a teen account, without worrying about them going down short-form video rabbit holes for hours. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe control here can be even more granular than an outright ban, too. Since you're always in control of the timer, YouTube says you can customize timers based on the scenario: You could set the Shorts timer to zero during homework time, then offer 30 minutes of scrolling after dinner. You could bump that to 60 minutes on weekends, or when in the car. If your child is under a supervised account, you'll also be able to control both custom Bedtime and \"Take a Break\" reminders. This is not the first time YouTube has offered users more control over Shorts. Last week, the company rolled out a new search filter that lets you choose to only see long-form videos in any given result, and since October, you've been able to limit the number of shorts you can watch in a day. YouTube, and parent company Google, are also expanding parental controls and enhancing protections for kids and teens. YouTube now uses AI to guess your age, and, if it believes you're under 18, will add restrictions to your account. Google also gives parents more control over supervised accounts: Previously, teens could choose to remove supervision after turning 13, but now, they need their parents to sign off on it too.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments. The scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic). \nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers. A nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBetterment data hackedCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. If you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I discovered the issue myself just after 9:30 a.m. ET. I was scrolling on my feed, when all of a sudden, new posts wouldn't load, and I was greeted by an option to refresh. When I did, the site reloaded, but now without any posts—only the futile option to try reloading again.You can see a steep spike in user reports on Downdetector (which, for full disclosure, is owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis). At the time of writing, roughly 25,000 users had reported issues with X, I among them. There are a number of potential reasons why X won't load this morning, but it doesn't appear to be a larger issue with a cloud hosting service. Anytime a major website like X goes down, it harkens back to global outages, stemming from issues with cloud hosting services like AWS and Cloudflare. However, a quick check on Downdetector shows me that few other sites and services are having massive outage reports at the moment. That could change, but as of this article, it seems like X's issues are their own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nX will no doubt get things back up and running soon. In the meantime, maybe it's best for all of us to get off the site for a change.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I’ll log the foods I eat, the exercise I do, but drinks just happen. Did I have one glass of water or two with lunch? Hell if I know. Not to mention that your hydration depends on all the H2O you take in, not just the glasses of plain water. You can hydrate with soup, with Diet Coke, or with slices of watermelon. Most hydration apps forget this, but even if they don’t, that just makes logging even more complicated.That’s why I was intrigued by the P Water app for iPhone and Apple Watch. It tracks exactly what you’d expect from the name. I’ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I'm a fan. I tap a button on my Apple Watch when I’m heading to the bathroom, and between pit stops, I can drink whatever I want without measuring or logging any of it. If it’s been a few hours since my last bathroom trip, the app will prompt me to drink water.This approach means that I get full credit for the water in my soup and Diet Coke, because it’s still hydrating me, and my internal hydration level is still triggering my bathroom trips. I spend a total of about 30 seconds each day thinking about the app, and I measure nothing. This is ideal for me.\nWhy it makes sense to track urination rather than water intakeThe developers of P Water were not the first to think of tracking water output rather than input. You may have noted this approach is sometimes used in medical settings, and as a new parent I remember being asked how many wet diapers my newborn was producing each day. P Water cites research showing that counting up the number of times you urinate per day can give a reasonably good estimate of how hydrated you are. For example, this study on healthy young men concludes that “[Void frequency] is a reliable index of 24-[hour] hydration status” so long as bathroom visits come at a consistent “urgency”—in other words, if you sometimes go when you don’t really have to, but sometimes hold it a long time, your pee count will be less reliable as a hydration indicator. That much is pretty obvious. Tracking output rather than input accounts for not just different sources of water in your diet, but also different hydration needs. For example, the “eight glasses of water a day” rule was never a particularly good one, especially when you consider that people come in different sizes and may have different activity levels. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, if you have a need to monitor your exact hydration, an app like P Water won’t necessarily do everything you need it to do. Medical providers often ask for specific amounts when they have people do what they call a “voiding diary.” But for a general sense of whether you’re hydrating enough that you’re peeing a normal amount, P Water seems to be a convenient tool. How to use the P Water app (with or without an Apple Watch)While it’s convenient to use P Water on an Apple Watch, it also works as a regular iPhone app. The full app has some convenient actions, like having a “log a pee” option when you long-press the home screen icon or when you swipe down to see Siri suggestions.I only used the app’s most basic features—logging bathroom visits, basically—but there’s more in the settings. You can enter notes for each pee, or even use a “stealth mode” that removes the word “pee” entirely. (On the other hand, you can also lean in and ask it to use the word “piss.”) While the core functions are mostly free, some of these bonuses, like stealth mode, require a subscription ($4.99/month or $39.99/year). \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Now, according to a new report, the iPhone company might actually go one step further and turn Siri into a full-fledged AI chatbot—one on par with the likes of ChatGPT, and perhaps even more sophisticated.Currently, Siri has AI implementation, but only technically, and it's certainly underwhelming: You can use it to get tech support on Apple products or shunt questions off to ChatGPT, but otherwise, Siri basically works as it always has. But according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reliably reported on insider information at Apple before, the company is finally not only looking to make Siri smarter, but also change the way you interact with it. Currently planned for iOS and macOS 27 under the name \"Campos,\" Siri's new chatbot interface will still be powered by Gemini, but will allow you to both type and talk to Siri, with full continuity between your conversations. This upgrade will be in addition to the overdue features that were already announced.In other words, it'll look something like the chatbot interface from the ChatGPT app or the standalone Gemini app. Yes, you can technically type to Siri right now, but it mostly works like a separate input method, rather than as a full conversation. You can't scroll through your previous questions to Siri or peruse the assistant's previous answers, and if you ask Siri to reference a message you sent it two weeks ago, it'll have no idea what you mean. That's far behind what other AI chatbots offer right now.\nThe update will also apparently further expand Siri's capabilities even beyond the contextual or personalization upgrades that were already revealed. Gurman says that, while the contextual upgrades will be able to pull information from other apps like Messages, the chatbot-style Siri will be \"integrated into all of the company's core apps, including ones for mail, music, podcasts, TV, Xcode programming software and photos.\" Essentially, Siri will have more access to your iPhone than other AI chatbots, and those integrations will go beyond what was previously promised. That could make it more or less appealing to you, depending on your tastes in AI integration.When the new Siri could arriveWith the chatbot interface planned for iOS 27, it's likely to come after the contextual upgrades, rather than at the same time. That's because, as Gurman said previously, those upgrades are set for the spring. He predicts we'll learn more about it during this year's WWDC, which, if it follows the standard set by previous years, will take place in June.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe move to turn Siri into a chatbot could come across as a a much-overdue modernization, as Google has already done the same with Gemini over on Android, but it's also a bit of a surprise, as Apple had previously said it did not intend to turn Siri into a \"bolt-on chatbot on the side\" for Apple Intelligence.But Apple was likely talking about quality of the experience rather than expressing any significant anti-chatbot bias among the development team, meaning the fact that Siri is turning into a chatbot could mean the company is finally happy with the direction it's headed. But it's also possible that the professed skepticism about turning Siri into a chatbot was meant to appeal to AI skeptics in general. Unfortunately, if you're still skeptical about AI, it currently seems like iOS 27 will be a boring update for you, as Gurman indicated the new Siri chatbot will be the \"primary new addition\" to the operating system.However you feel about it personally, Siri as a full-fledged AI chatbot could seriously upset ChatGPT's market dominance—ironic, given its early integration with Apple Intelligence. Currently, OpenAI has reportedly admitted it's in a Code Red situation, as it is losing market share to Google and introducing ads to bolster its bottom line. The new Siri, being powered by Gemini, is unlikely to hurt Google (although it will have more access to your phone than the standalone Gemini app), but its ease-of-access might make it the new go-to for iPhone users, and that could hurt pretty much every AI company Apple isn't in business with directly.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

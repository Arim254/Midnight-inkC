IP Check, from threat monitoring firm GreyNoise, will alert you if your IP address has been observed scanning the internet as part of a botnet or residential proxy network. As GreyNoise outlines, residential IP compromise often isn't obvious to the user because you're still able to conduct business as usual, such as streaming, emailing, and web browsing. All the while, though, threat actors are routing malicious activity through your home IP address and can potentially exploit your network for everything from account takeovers to malware distribution. Check your IP address for suspicious activityTo use IP Check, you simply need to open the tool in a browser window, and you'll get one of several results. If your IP is clean, that means that your network hasn't been caught scanning the internet (nor does it belong to any known business service infrastructure). \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nYour IP may also be flagged as being in the GreyNoise database, which is not a sign of compromise—this is likely because you're using a VPN, corporate network, or cloud provider, and the tool can distinguish between an IP belonging to a data center and one that's being exploited. (Note that Apple users browsing in Safari with Private Relay enabled will likely see \"Possible Spoofed Traffic Detected,\" which also is not necessarily cause for alarm. Try checking your real IP in a different browser like Chrome or Firefox to confirm.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Emily Long\n                    \n    \nIf your IP is identified as malicious or suspicious, you should investigate further. If you toggle open the Observed Activity section of the scanner, you can see when the first and last instances of the scanning behavior occurred and what types were detected along with actionable next steps. As BleepingComputer notes, you can get into the weeds with detecting malicious activity by reviewing device logs, network traffic, and activity patterns, but checking your IP address is the simplest place to start. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I can see why it's tempting to just blow everything up and start over, and the temptation goes far beyond emails: Declaring a personal bankruptcy and mass-deleting games, movies, and e-books you fear you’ll never play, watch, or read is a practice with proponents far and wide (including some of us here at Lifehacker). But declaring bankruptcy is such a drastic step. What if you tried inbox amnesty instead?What is inbox amnesty?The idea for inbox amnesty comes from Lifehacker’s health editor, Beth Skwarecki, who advocates for achieving inbox zero by selecting all your emails and archiving them, instead of deleting them. “BOOM,” she says. “You have inbox zero and will do better in the future.”While there are tricks you can employ to manage your inbox in real time and keep the number of unread messages down (like the “one touch” rule), there will still be times when your inbox gets unruly. That doesn’t bother some people, but the ever-increasing number in the notifications badge makes others feel like they’re losing their minds. If that’s you, declare inbox amnesty and just start over. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nPersonally, I don't much care what the red badge on my email app says. I have maintained the same primary email address since I was in high school and have designated numerous other addresses for various needs in my life. I gave up on the idea of \"inbox zero\" long, long ago. But I still get the compulsion to go bankrupt in other spheres. A bit over a year ago, I did a major cleaning and organizing overhaul in my apartment. I began by going scorched-earth, throwing things away right and left. I came to regret that quickly, as I tossed things I ended up needing, or at least could have sold or donated. Eventually, I designated two different closets as liminal spaces where I could let things marinate while I figured out what to do with them. That was my version of amnesty, and now, months later, I've freed up enough space and time to dedicate myself to my resale business, and I'm glad I didn't just go the bankruptcy route.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy inbox amnesty is better than inbox bankruptcyWhile inbox amnesty and bankruptcy both rely on the same idea—nuking all the emails and starting again, determined not to let the unreads get out of hand this time—there is one key difference: Amnesty doesn’t destroy the emails forever, it just marks them as read and tucks them away, out of sight. Just as I learned the value of keeping unwanted things around when I did my big apartment decluttering, you might learn it when you accidentally delete an email you need back in the future. Email amnesty helps you avoid learning the hard way.With amnesty, you can go back into that archive if you need to, finding contact information or threads that you might actually need to follow up on in the future. If you go bankrupt and destroy them all, you won’t be able to refer to anything from the past—and you just know something will come up that requires you to look at an older email you no longer have. You can set a reminder for yourself to fully delete your archived messages after six months if they don’t become necessary, but as long as they’re not clogging up too much of your storage, feel free to hold onto them in case of emergency. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: verona studio - Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        There are a lot of methods to try in the never-ending quest for a way to sort through and slim down our bulging inboxes. They're different enough that there's certainly one out there that matches or comes close to matching your exact needs, but they do all have one thing in common: They rely on the chronology of when each email came in. Let’s try turning that approach on its head, and instead, sort by sender to weed through the mess.Why you should sort your inbox by senderWhen purging your messages, you probably have an organizational system you follow, like the 4Ds. You go through and decide what gets deleted, done, delegated, or deferred—but there’s not much pattern recognition if you’re just starting at the top and working your way down. Every day's demands or outreach might look different depending on what you have going on at that time. Sorting your inbox by sender instead of most recent helps you see whose (or what) messages you receive most. If it’s a newsletter or mailing list, you can delete them all in one go, but if it’s a specific person at work, you might get a signal that they tend to need a response from you. From there, you can prioritize their emails, maybe adding them as a favorite contact or paying special attention for new correspondence from them, since you know their messages are more consequential than others. Even if you're using the one- or two-touch methods, which call on you to open every single email the moment you get it, this can be helpful because you'll feel a sense of urgency around specific senders once you identify the patterns. So instead of deleting or delegating emails one by one, you can try nuking or dealing with entire batches from certain senders to make the sorting process faster. How to sort by sender in GmailIn Gmail, if you’ve already found a message from the person or entity whose emails you want to bundle up, you can right-click it from your inbox and hit “find emails from.” This brings you to an inbox only of messages from that sender. You can also access this inbox by typing “from:[their email address]” in the search bar, or clicking the advanced search button  and entering their name into the “from” field.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, you can’t sort your entire Gmail inbox by sender, and instead can only make bundles sender by sender, but it still helps with batching them up.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to sort by sender in OutlookOutlook is better than Gmail for this method. In fact, it allows you to sort your entire inbox not only by sender, but by other recipients, size, and more.At the top of the inbox, hit “Filter,” then “Sort by.” Depending on what version you’re running, you may have to go into the “View” tab and hit “From” in the Arrangement group. The emails will line up in your inbox by sender, making them easy to bundle and delete.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

These horrors will visit you at all hours of the day, making it harder to spot the truly important messages in your inbox—and it gets worse once you've gotten fed up enough to disable push notifications and they start to really pile up. It’s time to banish these buggers. And, if you're using Gmail, there’s an easy way to do it.Use filters to manage mailing list emails in GmailYou can use a third-party add-on to go through your mailing lists and unsubscribe, saying goodbye to newsletters and e-blasts. But you know what’s easier and less expensive? Setting a filter in Gmail. Open up one of your mailing list emails and click the three dots in the menu bar. You’ll see “Mark as unread,” “Mark as important,” and a few other options, but the one you want is “Filter messages like these.”\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Gmail\n                    \n    \nFrom there, you’ll see a dialog box asking how you want to filter your messages. You can filter by sender, recipients, and subjects, but also by anything that “has the words…” In the “has the words” row, type “unsubscribe.” \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, any email containing the word “unsubscribe”—which reputable email blasts almost always do—can be filtered out of your inbox without you having to do anything. Once you type “unsubscribe” there, hit the “create filter” button. The following dialog box will ask how you want these filtered. You can choose to have them archived, marked as read, starred, forwarded, or immediately deleted.Things to consider when creating Gmail filtersI recommend archiving over deleting in case you ever want to find them again, but if you are sure you’ll never want to open another mailing list, newsletter, or sales blast, feel free to check the box next to “delete.” Note that if you choose to archive but later want to delete them, you’ll have to do so manually. Personally, I am happy to pay for extra Google storage to keep a record of messages instead of inadvertently lose something I need, but I know that's needlessly neurotic. If you do end up archiving those, the next step needs to be actually unsubscribing from the messages you truly don't want to receive. Gmail has recently made this a lot easier: You can usually click an unsubscribe button up at the top of the offending email. The Google-run email service also rolled out a Manage Subscriptions service this past summer, so once you take a gander at the archive full of junk and notice what you're not exactly needing or opening up, you can head over there and nuke your subscriptions quickly and easily. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As holiday sale season winds down, the Better Business Bureau is warning buyers about a scheme in which fraudsters charge you for \"out of stock\" goods and fail to refund your money. The out-of-stock purchase scam is simple: After you buy a product online, scammers send you a notification that said item is no longer available, cancel your order, and tell you that you'll get your money back. Obviously, the refund never arrives, and no one ever responds to further inquiries. As the BBB points out, in most cases, the item you thought you bought probably never existed in the first place—rather, scammers are selling fake stock, charging customers, and vanishing in hopes you won't notice that you didn't receive your refund. Some consumers who submitted reports to the BBB Scam Tracker said that they did receive products, but items were of poor quality or not what they ordered, and no refund was ever issued. Spot out-of-stock purchase scamsThese fake purchase schemes may have the usual red flags, like prices that are too good to be true, especially those promoted on social media. Personalized items are ripe for scams, as are hard-to-find products or collectibles. If you find an amazing deal from a company or seller you don't recognize, search the name with \"scam\" and read reviews on Google and Reddit to identify patterns of suspicious activity (or poor-quality products). You should also be wary of websites that aren't secure—those that don't start with HTTPS or have a lock icon in the browser bar—as these are more vulnerable to hackers looking to intercept credit card info and other personal data. Legitimate vendors collect payment securely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nShop with a credit cardShopping scams are a good reason to use a credit card for online purchases, as they offer protection against fraudulent charges. If you don't receive a refund from a seller, you can file a chargeback—while this isn't as simple or swift a process, it is likely you'll get your money eventually.  Always keep receipts, order confirmations, and any communication with sellers in case you need to make a claim for a scam purchase. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There are exceptions for third-party addresses, like work emails tied to a company's domain, but for the typical @gmail.com account, no dice. Personally, I've had a number of loyalty programs and store accounts tied to an embarrassingly edgy email from high school for decades now, but finally, it seems like I'll be able to change it.A recently updated Google support page says the company is now \"gradually rolling out\" the ability to change your Gmail address, with some limitations. Oddly, the page is only available in Hindi for the moment, so I've reached out to Google for clarification about where and when the feature will be available and will update when I hear back. Still, the support page does say (through a machine translation) that the feature's coming \"to all users,\" which implies it'll see a global release at some point.For good measure, I checked if I could change any of my personal gmail addresses, but no luck. But once the feature rolls out to you, here's how you'll be able to do it.On a computer or mobile device, navigate to myaccount.google.com/google-account-email.At the top of the page, click or tap \"Personal Information.\" On mobile, this may show up as \"Personal Info.\"Click or Tap on \"Google Account Email.\"From there, click or tap on \"Change Your Google Account Email Address\" and enter your updated email address.Note that these instructions were filtered through a machine translation, so exact wording may differ depending on region. I'll update with official English instructions when available, but the process does seem simple enough.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThere are a couple of wrinkles, however. The big one is that emails sent to your old address will still be sent to your new one, and that your old email may still show up instead of your new one in some cases, like on Calendar events created before you changed your address. That's because your former name will be listed as an alias for the account, rather than deleted. That could be a pain if you're trying to leave old contacts behind, but it'll also ensure important contacts don't get lost in the shuffle, and it'll keep anyone else from registering a new account with that email address. You'll also still be able to use your old gmail address to sign into any accounts associated with it, and regardless of which name you sign in with, you'll still have access to all of your messages, photos, and other files. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYou can also revert to your old address at any time, but as for changing it to a new address, you can only do it once a year, and only three times total. So no changing it to a wacky new address every Halloween and then back to normal come November.Still, it should be a major quality-of-life upgrade, and should help Google's email service better catch up to more permissive email providers like Proton. No more sounding like an edgelord every time I talk to the checkout clerk at Sephora.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As such, it’s best handled with the use of a strict system, but those can be tricky to implement and stick to. Also like so much else, finding the right system is time-intensive and adds a new layer of stress onto an already annoying task. Here’s a system that’s simple, doesn’t take a lot of time to start using, and can actually help you get through your unreads without overwhelming you. It’s called “yesterbox.”What is the yesterbox inbox management system?This technique—and its funny name—both come from late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, who described yesterbox as a way of “relieving email guilt.” The concept is simple: Today, you only deal with yesterday’s emails. It's like a slightly stricter version of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, and while I don't always love FIFO, I recognize it has a place in a well-rounded productivity approach—and yesterbox is a great example.Hsieh believed that “inbox zero” is not only an elusive goal, but a nearly impossible one. As soon as you start replying to emails, responses arrive. By its very nature, email is a form of correspondence, which means you’re sending and receiving—and for it to be effective, it has to be ongoing.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nThe thing is, though, that you don’t know how many emails you’ll get today. The only true, finite number you can count on is the number of emails you got yesterday, so that’s where your focus should be if you want to prevent yourself from getting caught up in the back-and-forth of immediate communication.Start by picking a time to deal with emails every day. Ideally, this should be in the morning, so nothing too urgent from yesterday slips through the cracks. Try using timeboxing to schedule your day and blocking out a dedicated time—a half an hour or so, depending on the volume of actionable emails you usually receive and how much of your work is actually done through them—for email management every morning. Hsieh was a proponent of dedicating three hours to this task, but he was the CEO of a giant company, so be realistic about how long it will actually take you. Spend some time trying different approaches to time management and to-do list creation, like the 3-3-3 list or 1-3-5 method. Figuring out how long email management should take you, as well as how much of a resource suck it actually is, will take a little effort, but those frameworks help. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse that time to only look at and respond to emails you got the previous day. Next, filter out the emails from the previous day that will require more effort from you, whether it’s a lengthy response or the inclusion of attachments. You can star them or move them to a folder, but focus first on the ones that require simple responses—or no response at all. You're more or less using the two-touch email management technique here, but specifically scheduling yourself so you're only applying it to yesterday's messages. Go through each before returning to the ones that will take some more serious effort. Once that’s done, don’t look again until the next morning.This creates a finite to-do list that doesn’t go on all day. By looking at each day’s previous emails systematically, you won’t miss any, either. The only real exception to this rule should be urgent, day-of emails about tasks that are taking place in the moment. If you’re expecting any like that, add the sender to your priority list to make sure you get the notifications and, if possible, ask them to make the subject line something easily identifiable. Resist the urge to look at any emails related to anything else but pressing, immediate issues. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This scheme, dubbed GhostPairing by researchers, uses WhatsApp's device linking process to allow fraudsters to access all of your messages, impersonate you in chats, and perpetuate the scam to your contacts. Here's how threat actors are hijacking WhatsApp accounts—and how to defend yours. GhostPairing manipulates WhatsApp device linkingWhatsApp allows users to link their desktop or browser to their account without needing to enter login credentials in one of two ways: scanning a QR code and approving the session or confirming a numeric pairing code in the mobile app. While the GhostPairing scam could theoretically manipulate users in either approach, researchers found that the latter is much more common. The fraud begins with a short message sent from a contact with a link that purportedly goes to a Facebook photo or some type of Facebook content. If you click through, you'll be directed to a spoofed Facebook login page to enter your phone number—a familiar confirmation flow for Meta platforms. The next screen will likely show a numeric code with instructions to enter said code into WhatsApp to confirm the login (again, this may feel like a familiar two-step verification). If you're not paying attention, you may not realize that this didn't do anything on your end but instead registered the attacker's browser as a linked device to your account. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe danger in this scam is that everything will seem normal on your device and in your account, as attackers haven't hijacked your credentials to lock you out. However, they can do anything and everything in WhatsApp that you can, such as reading chats, receiving messages, viewing and downloading media, collecting information from your contacts, and forwarding the same phishing link. As they learn more about you and the people you know, they can potentially use that for ongoing scams. How to protect your WhatsApp accountAs always, be wary of links received via messaging platforms, even if they seem harmless or you think you know and can trust the sender. Threat actors frequently use social media and direct messaging to spread phishing lures. If you do click a link in WhatsApp (or any other communication), read all prompts carefully before providing or verifying any information to identify scams. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo protect your WhatsApp account specifically, you can set up two-step verification, which will also prevent attackers from adding or changing a connected email address. Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN and add an email address when prompted. You can also check to see if there are any suspicious devices paired with your account under Settings > Linked devices and remove any you don't recognize or regularly use.Finally, if you have been targeted by this scam, let your WhatsApp contacts know, as threat actors may spread the malicious link by making it look like it came from you. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n    \n        \n        New Year’s resolutions are all about improving ourselves, right? The same goes for your best buddy—your dog. While your dog can’t physically tell you what they need to feel their best, there are simple things you can do to help set them up for success. Right now, you can save 50% off your first box of human-grade The Farmer’s Dog pet food, so that’s a great start.

Eventually, replace your finger with the toothbrush.Teach your dog some new tricksWhile daily walks with your dog are key for physical fitness (for both you and your pup), training your dog is a fantastic way to provide them with intellectual stimulation. Teach your dog to sit or some ‘Gram-worthy tricks like playing Bach on the piano, as long as you give them positive affirmation, your pet will feel like the good dog they are. When you’re making resolutions this year, don’t forget about your pup.

Whatever your reasons, you’re in need of a last-minute gift, and your options are limited. If you're reading this at a time when it's too late for online delivery, and in-person store options are already closed, then all that’s left is the glory of your local 24-hour drug store.If you have access to a major chain like Walgreens or CVS, you could be in surprisingly good shape for this last-minute gift. All it takes is a little ingenuity to level up this gift from \"a protein bar\" to \"a gym bro collection,\" or \"some loose nail polish\" to a \"curated at-home spa day.\"Following this logic, I’ve carefully categorized your gift options into three tiers. The first is for gift-givers willing to shell out a little extra cash in their panic in order to create something somewhat personalized. The second tier includes single-item purchases that are simply passable gift options. The third tier is a warning.Tier one: DIY signature collectionsLike a chef turning baskets of mystery ingredients into a three-course meal on Chopped, this category of gifts is all about your innovation. In these DIY arrangements, the sum is greater than its parts, which should all be available at most chain drug stores. Here are some of our ideas for themed collections, but feel free to customize at your convenience.\n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nMovie night: Popcorn. Funky popcorn toppings. Candy. Hot chocolate. Fuzzy socks. A little slip of paper with your Netflix login. You can’t go wrong with a cozy movie-night theme.Treat yo’ self: Think spa day materials, like face masks, nail polish, and bath bombs. Throw in a candle to help set the pampering vibe.Health and wellness: Browse around for gummy vitamins, supplements, protein powder, and whatever else catches your eye in the fitness aisle. Be warned: This one can quickly get expensive. The Jetsetter: Pick from the array of travel-sized must-haves, including ear plugs and perhaps even a neck pillow (with a note about how to wear it right). The Techie: Head to the electronics section and go wild with whatever gadgets are available and within your price range. Portable chargers and speakers are quality gifts in their own right. Tier two: It’s the thought that countsThese items aren’t necessarily bad gifts, but many will be easily detected as a last-minute purchase. The success of tier two drug store gifts will come down to the charm of the gift-giver and the chill factor of the recipient.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGift cardsCandlesCosmetic bagsTherapeutic massagerJewelryInsulated mugsCalendars or plannersNotebooksCoffee/tea bundlesWine and a corkscrew (depending on your state’s liquor laws)Picture framesElectronics, like ear buds or portable chargersTier three: “Gifts” that will do more harm than goodHey, buddy. All is lost, huh? Personally, I recommend a white lie about an imaginary gift that didn’t arrive in time. Unless you’re confident you can pull off a gag gift, proceed with caution should you opt to gift someone anything from the list below.

Just as the Nintendo Switch introduced the world to console gaming on the go, the Steam Deck was the pioneer in bringing PC gaming to a handheld form factor—even if it pushes the definition of \"handheld.\" Part of the initial appeal of the Steam Deck is its price: While you could choose a souped-up model with an OLED display and expanded internal storage, you could also pick up an LCD model with a 256GB SSD at a reasonable $399. For less than the price of a Switch 2, you could have something that plays the entire Steam library, with its huge variation in games. It's a great deal—perhaps too great. If you go to Valve's official Steam Deck site, and scroll down to see your hardware choices, you'll notice something interesting: While there appear to be many 512GB and 1TB OLED Steam Decks in stock, ready to buy, the entry-level LCD model is \"out of stock.\" Hardware selling out isn't uncommon, of course—other popular devices like the Switch 2 sell out fast, and can sometimes be hard to come by. The assumption then is that Valve will make more LCD Steam Decks, so that gamers can buy into the platform without spending the extra $150 for the 512GB OLED model. However, it doesn't appear that the LCD Steam Deck is coming back anytime soon—or at all. While it's easy to miss if you're just looking at the buy links themselves, scroll down a bit further on Valve's site, and you'll see the following footnote: \"We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.\" And seeing as the item is currently listed as out of stock, it seems fair to say that the LCD Steam Deck is no more. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nValve doesn't have an official reason why it is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but some speculate the root cause is rising component prices—namely, RAM and storage costs. These computing parts are skyrocketing in price, which might lead companies like Valve to pare down its hardware selection. Why waste expensive resources on a $399 machine, when you could instead push some of those potential buyers into the $549 machine?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCan you buy the LCD Steam Deck elsewhere?The short answer? Yes, but I'd encourage you not to. The most reliable seller to purchase a Steam Deck from is Valve itself. Otherwise, you may either overpay for your Steam Deck, or, potentially, get scammed. Take this Amazon listing, for example where the model appears to be $459.99. The seller has misspelled the name of the device, and has labeled it under \"Apparel.\" While it might be tempting to save $90 when compared to the official 512GB OLED model, I'd skip the Amazon option. Another questionable Amazon seller has the 256GB model for $829.99, while selling the 512GB OLED model for $899.99. Again, that's either highway robbery, or a good old fashioned scam. If you're dead set on not spending $549 on a new Steam Deck, you could look at the used market, but even then, things are rough. People aren't really selling these things, and when they are, they're selling them for quite a bit. You might have some luck on a site like eBay, where I'm currently seeing some OLED Steam Decks selling around $400. But buyer beware: Buying items used through a third-party seller can be risky. Without the proper safety nets, you might be better off stretching for the official hardware from Valve. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

As reported by Krebs on Security, researchers at security firm Infoblox have identified a swath of scams on lookalike and parked (or placeholder) domains. If you end up on one of these websites, you'll be directed not to the trusted page you're expecting but scam content, including scareware and other malware.  Lookalike domains contain malicious contentThis scam capitalizes on you navigating directly to a website by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. If you accidentally mistype either the top-level domain (TLD)—.gov or .com, for example—or the second-level domain (SLD), which is the company name (Google or Amazon), you could land on a page that has been commandeered by threat actors for malicious purposes. In some cases, these may be typosquats, meaning cybercriminals have registered domain names that look nearly identical to trusted ones. In others, they may be real domains that have expired and are simply advertising placeholders that spread malware. Infoblox researchers found that visiting one of these sites often initiates a chain of redirects, through which threat actors profile data like your IP geolocation, device fingerprint, and cookies. That means you don't necessarily need to click any links on the parked page to be served malicious content. They note, though, that parked websites were only malicious if visited from a residential IP address and benign if accessed using a VPN or a non-residential IP. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to avoid parked domain scamsOne common piece of advice for avoiding phishing websites is to type trusted URLs directly into the address bar rather than clicking through search, as threat actors will try to exploit results, including placing paid ads, to redirect you to malicious domains. This can still be a safe way to get to your destination, but you should check your spelling of both TLDs and SLDs carefully, as small errors could land you on a scam site. I've covered similar website trickery like homograph attacks, which use lookalike characters in URLs to direct you to phishing sites that, on the surface, appear to be legitimate domains. Unless you inspect the address very carefully, you may not catch the scam.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Your information may have been compromised in a massive breach affecting more than 5.8 million consumers, and you should take the necessary steps to protect your data. 700Credit supplies credit and identity verification services to more than 21,000 vehicle, RV, powersport, and marine dealerships in the U.S., so if you've purchased a vehicle and applied for dealer financing—or even been pre-screened or pre-qualified to do so—your information could have been affected. What happened with 700Credit?According to the company's filing with the Maine Attorney General, 700Credit's systems were hacked between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27. Attackers stole personal information about customers of 700Credit's dealership clients, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and dates of birth. As BleepingComputer reports, this breach was actually a consequence of a system compromise back in July at one of 700Credit's 200 integration partners. Threat actors were able to gain access to an API used to pull consumer data, and a security vulnerability in the API allowed them to exfiltrate information from 700Credit. What you need to doIf you receive a data breach notice from 700Credit, read it carefully. 700Credit is offering 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion's Cyberscout to affected consumers. You will need to go to the URL listed in your notice and enter your unique activation code in order to enroll, and you have 90 days from the date of the letter to complete the process. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n700Credit expects to begin notifying individuals starting on Dec. 22. In addition to utilizing the free credit protection, you should take the usual precautions to lock down your identity: Freeze your credit at all three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion).Place a fraud alert on your credit file. You only need to do this at one bureau, which will apply it to all three. Keep an eye on your financial accounts for suspicious transactions as well as your credit report. Note that if your credit is frozen, thieves shouldn't be able to take out new credit in your name. Request an IP PIN from the IRS to prevent someone from filing a tax return using your SSN. Follow good digital hygiene practices, such as using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. You cannot reverse a data breach, but you can (and should) do damage control. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When that happens, you can might yourself getting distracted and missing important messages—at least, that's what happens to me, unless I have some kind of plan in place.There are a few different approaches you can consider to prevent this, but the \"OHIO\" technique is the one to try if you need extra help being decisive—though it's important to note that while it can ease your decision paralysis, it does have a few limitations worth considering. What is the OHIO method of time management?OHIO is an acronym for “Only Handle It Once” and you'll hear it crop up in a variety of productivity-based conversations, like ones around tidying up. Proponents say it helps you avoid unnecessary dawdling, delays, and indecision, as it calls for you to handle any task, email, message, or assignment just one time. It's definitely a habit you need to build up to, but it's one that pays off the longer you work at it.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nYou can broadly apply it to what you’re working by assessing your entire inbox, to-do list, or other group of tasks all at once. Prioritize the tasks in order of importance using a system like the Eisenhower Matrix or ABC method. (If the workload isn’t too complex, feel free to prioritize them quickly on your own without a fancy system, but I'm a big fan of customizing hyper-specific productivity techniques to meet my needs.) Then take immediate action on each, starting from the top. Either delete them, delegate them, do what they say, or defer them, using the 4D method.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe OHIO method works great for emails, too, but it can suck you into time-wasting if you’re not careful. Only handling each email once is a solid way not to spend too much time on it, but you have to plan what you’re going to do. Otherwise, you may end up clicking every new email that comes in and trying to manage it in real time.Emails are harder to prioritize than a to-do list, so you may struggle to determine which one you should jump on first. Instead of implementing the OHIO method in the moment every moment, set aside time every morning and afternoon to go through your messages and, of course, only handle them once. (You can use time boxing and time blocking to make sure you do this at the same time every day, plus a 3-3-3 to-do list to make sure you have time to prioritize the task.) Try a half hour at the start of your workday, a half hour after lunch, and 15 minutes just before clocking out. If you base your approach on time, rather than a prioritized list, you’ll still be able to open each message and handle it, but won’t be swamped by having to do that every time you get a new alert. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There are cameras just about everywhere we go these days: Security cameras, video doorbells, and smartphones are frequently recording, and so ubiquitous that I tend to figure that if I go out in public, I'm being watched.But when you're driving, it can be a different story. Sure, there are cameras on the road—either street cameras or cameras built directly into modern cars—but there are plenty of moments behind the wheel where nothing you do is recorded. You could view this as a nice reprieve from the surveillance of modern life, but it also means that if you get into an accident, it could quickly turn into a \"he said, she said\" incident. Someone could reverse directly into your car, but because there were no cameras around to document the accident, your insurance company could throw their hands in the air and make you both pay for something that wasn't your fault. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nI've never been in that situation, but I was tired of worrying about it. My car is on the older side, and doesn't come with any of the modern safety features newer cars now include—including cameras. Where something like a Tesla records everything in and around the car, my vehicle records nothing. If someone accidentally hit my car, or worse, intentionally tried to scam me, I could be out of luck, and without clear evidence I wasn't at fault.  You won't regret buying a dashcam, even if you never use it After following one too many threads online sharing such horror stories, I decided it was time to get myself a dashcam.But before I could, I was gifted one last Christmas—a Redtiger 4K dashcam. It was easy enough to set up, though even after a full year of use, I'm not taking full advantage of it yet: The main unit attaches to my front windshield, with a cable that plugs into the cigarette lighter port, but this particular model also comes with a rear camera that requires a little extra maneuvering to install. I've been a bit lazy on that front, but I should get cracking, since it would be helpful to have a camera protecting the back of my car, too.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI almost wish I had some harrowing tale to tell that shows off how the dashcam saved me during the past year, or even a story about capturing some wild driving habits from my fellow drivers. But, spoiler alert: I haven't actually had to put it to use, as I've fortunately not been in an accident, or even experienced an interesting close call. But the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if an otherwise ambiguous fender bender has been refreshing. It's nice to know when I'm driving on a particularly busy road that I have a little extra protection should someone jump their lane or decide to text and drive.There are so many different dashcam models, so I won't try to make the case that mine specifically is the one that everyone should buy. But there are a few things I like about it: First, the main unit records in 4K, which means your videos will be clear enough to use in the event you need to prove yourself innocent. While 4K takes up more recording space than 1080p, this model is designed to record over itself when it fills up. Since you probably don't need all your driving footage, you don't really need to worry about running out of space, and can grab the file when something actually happens. There are other features that I don't use, like wifi connectivity as well as a smart app, but I prefer to just grab the footage off the included SD card—at least, I would if I ever needed it.  \n            \n    ",

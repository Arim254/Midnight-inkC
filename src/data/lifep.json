The scheme, a recent iteration of a ClickFix attack, is designed to trick you into executing a dangerous command under the guise of completing a \"critical security update.\" But what you're actually doing is installing an infostealer that hands data over to bad actors. When a Windows update pop-up is actually a ClickFix attackClickFix is a social engineering ploy that uses tactics like fake error messages, CAPTCHA forms, and command prompts to deliver malware to your device. As PCMag reports, the Windows update scam is a pop-up that looks like a standard Windows blue screen but is actually a full screen browser page being displayed from a malicious domain. The ClickFix element is a set of keystrokes—not part of the real update interface—that have the user paste and execute a malicious command, ultimately delivering malware to their device. These instructions have an air of urgency, which is a common element of a scam. \nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Huntress have detailed the exact mechanism behind this attack, including an iteration in which users are prompted to verify they are human (rather than complete a security update). As Bleeping Computer outlines, the malicious code is embedded into the pixel data of PNG images, and the final payload is one of two known infostealers.According to the Huntress analysis, following a recent law enforcement operation, fake Windows update pages continue to exist across multiple domains, but those domains no longer seem to host the malware payload. That doesn't mean, however, that this attack, or some version of it, won't pop up elsewhere. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to stay safe from this ClickFix attackIf you run Windows on your device, you've probably seen a blue or black update or error screen many times, and you may not be suspicious if your computer randomly begins an update or prompts you to take an extra step to confirm it. But while a legitimate update screen will have a progress indicator and instructions not to turn off your computer, you should never need to input manual commands. This is a red flag of a ClickFix attack and not something a trusted service will require.  Of course, it's important to keep your computer up to date. Microsoft releases security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, known as Patch Tuesday, and you can enable automatic updates on your machine to ensure you get fixes as soon as they're available. If you want to take additional steps to prevent ClickFix attacks on Windows, you can disable the Windows Run box to prevent unauthorized access to commands.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's the hard part.You could look up the documentation for the application or explore the menu bar—but if you're on a Mac, you could also just install KeyClu. This free application shows an overlay with all the keyboard shortcuts for the currently open Mac application, which is very useful for anyone trying to become a more keyboard-savvy computer user.To get started, install the application. Then, you'll need to choose a trigger key (basically one of the modifier keys on your keyboard). By default, you will tap the key twice and hold on the second tap to trigger the overlay, but you can optionally set the application to simply press and hold the key if you prefer. I opted to press and hold Command.\nAfter that, you'll be asked to enable permissions so KeyClu can access the keyboard shortcuts for your applications. Then you can start using the application. I tend to ignore the application until I wonder whether a keyboard shortcut for a particular function exists. I trigger the application, look through the list of keyboard shortcuts, and see what's available. When I let go of the trigger key, the window disappears.This default floating window is useful, but you might want a window listing shortcuts to stay open even when you let go of the trigger. That's where the persistent panel comes in. This window, which you can trigger using the menu bar, stays open and always shows a list of keyboard shortcuts for the currently active application. You can add a separate keyboard shortcut for this window in the settings, if you like.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf you dig around in KeyClu's settings, you can configure the layout of both the pop-up and persistent panels, changing the size of the windows, how many columns shortcuts are sorted into, and which display the panels show up on.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIt's a simple piece of software, but it's completely free and can help you get better at using your computer.

Fraudsters prey on people's fear, confusion, and desire to protect their money, which may lead targets to hand over login credentials, make irreversible wire transfers, or provide other sensitive information without stopping to question their actions. Android users in the U.S. will soon have extra protection against scams targeting their financial apps, preventing threat actors impersonating bank representatives from accessing data on their devices. Google's in-call scam protection is designed to prevent users from sharing their screens with threat actors and help them avoid revealing their banking information. How Android in-call protection worksAndroid's scam protection kicks in if you are on a phone call with a number not saved in your contacts and attempt to open a participating financial app. You'll get a pop-up warning that the call is likely a scam with a reminder not to make payments or share personal information and a button to end the call (and stop screen sharing). There's also a 30-second delay on further action on your device, which Google says is designed to disrupt any sense of urgency. \nNote that financial institutions must opt into in this feature—at this time, Google has specifically named Cash App and JPMorganChase as partners, though it indicates expansion to other popular fintechs and banks. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle initially rolled out in-call protections for banking apps to UK users earlier this year as part of a larger package of security features announced ahead of Google I/O. That launch also included real-time scam detection alerts for calls and texts, improved theft protection via remote lock and identity check, key verifier for Google Messages, and device-level Advanced Protection (in addition to account-level settings). Alongside the US pilot, in-call scam protections will now cover most major banks in the UK as well as financial apps in Brazil and India. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The December patch covers 107 bugs across Android Kernel, System, and Framework as well as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, Unisoc, and Imagination Technologies components. The high-severity vulnerabilities include denial of service, elevation of privilege, and information disclosure flaws. There are also a handful of bugs labeled as \"critical.\" Two active exploitsTwo of the vulnerabilities addressed in the December update are zero-days, which are flaws that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer makes a patch available. Google notes that both may be under \"limited, targeted exploitation.\" \nCVE-2025-48633 is an information disclosure vulnerability, while CVE-2025-48572 is an elevation of privilege flaw. Both affect the Android Framework in versions 13 through 16. Google hasn't disclosed any additional information about the flaws and how they may have been exploited (or by whom). However, as Bleeping Computer reports, similar bugs have been targeted in the past by commercial spyware operations and nation-state campaigns. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnsure your Android device is up to dateYou should always implement security patches as soon as they're available, so if you see a notification to update, go ahead and follow the prompts to download and install it. You can also check for updates via a path like Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update. Note that this may be slightly different depending on your device, and you can always search \"update\" to locate it. This month's patches apply to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and are dated 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05—the latter fixes all known issues. Pixel users (and the core AOSP code) receive patches from Google, and those on other Android devices from Huawei, LGE, Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia should see updates from their respective manufacturers around the same time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That isn't always the case with Apple, however. The company has a long history of removing functions from one generation of devices to the next, whether that's removing the disc drive from its MacBooks back in 2012, or taking away the iPhone's Home button in 2017. Some of these changes are good, some are controversial, while others are undone altogether: MagSafe and HDMI both found their way back to MacBooks after all.It's not often I hear about Apple removing software features from one generation of product to the next, however. So, imagine my surprise when I saw a number of headlines this morning asserting that the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple's latest and greatest flagship, is missing a feature found in the last five generations of Pro iPhones—and nobody noticed for nearly three months. Night mode is missing from Portrait mode on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The short answer? We have no idea. This was not something Apple announced publicly, of course. In fact, Macworld spotted the change in an Apple support doc: If you scroll down to the section where it says \"On supported models, you can take Night mode photos with Portrait mode,\" and click the hyperlink on \"On supported models,\" you'll pull up a list of iPhones that, mysteriously, doesn't include the 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max. The list includes:\niPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro Max For the uninitiated, Night mode and Portrait mode are technically two distinct features. Portrait mode was released first, all the way back on the iPhone 7 Plus, which utilized the dual-camera system to add a bokeh effect to shots of people. Those early shots were hit or miss, and were often no replacement for a true DSLR, but as Apple's tech and cameras have improved, so has Portrait mode. Part of the improvement was the introduction of Night mode. This feature, which Apple was a bit late to the game on, allowed you to take brighter images in low-light environments by lengthening the time the shutter stays engaged. Older iPhones without the feature would take images that were hard to see without the flash engaged, but Night mode could pull in details as long as there was just enough light present in the scene. Since the iPhone 12 Pro, Portrait mode came with the option of Night mode, as well. If you're trying to take a portrait shot in a dark environment, Night mode kicks in and gives the image a chance to turn out brighter and more detailed. But now, it seems, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max do not have this option. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo be clear, these new iPhones still have Night mode: Per that previously mentioned support page, you can take brighter shots at night when taking standard photos, selfies, and time-lapse videos. It just seems Apple decided to remove the feature for Portrait mode shots on its latest Pros.Of course, this news started breaking on Dec. 3, nearly three months after the 17 Pros launched. If it took this long for someone to notice a missing feature, was it really all that important to begin with? I don't have a 17 Pro, so I really can't say, but I also can't say I take many Portrait mode shots in dark environments. I've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this story if I hear back. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The ANC AirPods 4 are $99 (originally $179.99) after a 45% discount. This is the lowest price they've ever been, according to price-tracking tools.\nThe AirPods 4 have updated USB-C charging. Both models (the ANC and non-ANC) are powered by Apple's H2 chip, so you'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" and answer calls. Apple added a live translation feature to the ANC model when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year.The biggest difference if you choose to go with the non-ANC is that you'll miss out on the charging case with a built-in speaker, which you can use with Find My to locate it if you lose them. You'll also miss features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio (combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBoth versions are rated IP54 for dust and water resistance, offer up to five hours of listening per charge (up to 30 hours with the charging case), and can handle automatic switching with your other Apple devices.

It brings one of my favorite Mac apps to Microsoft's operating system. In fact, I've enjoyed using Raycast for Windows so much, I can't see myself going back to the non-Raycast life. This app is free to download and use, though there is an optional paid subscription for those who want certain additional features. What is Raycast?\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nAt its heart, Raycast is an app that lets you search for apps and files stored in your computer. It stays hidden until you press its keyboard shortcut (Alt-Space on Windows). Once you do, Raycast appears as a floating search bar on the desktop. You can type anything you want to locate in the search bar, and Raycast forages through your computer to find it. I primarily use it as an app launcher since I have way too many apps on my Mac (and PC). Raycast helps me find the right app quickly and open it.That's just the surface layer of Raycast, though. You can use Raycast to search for files on your computer, retrieve items you've copied to the clipboard, send queries to ChatGPT (or other AI tools), convert currencies and units, and much more. All of these features are available under the same simple floating search bar.\nSet up keyboard shortcuts in Raycast\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nRaycast is designed for people who love keyboard shortcuts. You can totally use it without them, but you'll enjoy it a lot more if you set up a few shortcuts of your own. As an example, if you open Raycast and press Tab, it switches to AI mode, and you can directly send your questions and requests to ChatGPT from Raycast.Whenever you search for anything in Raycast, you'll probably see a button called Record hotkey next to the results. This is your cue to set up a keyboard shortcut for that action, and doing so will allow you to get to it faster. You can also go to Raycast settings to find commonly used actions and record your preferred keyboard shortcuts for all of them.Note that the Raycast app is still in beta on Windows, and during this trial period, you can use these AI features for free. Expect that to change, though, once it's out of beta. If you want to keep using these features, the pro tier costs $8 per month for most AI models, but certain advanced AI models are only available in the $16 per month subscription tier.What I use Raycast for on Windows\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI use Raycast for a lot more than just launching apps on Windows. As someone who lives outside the US, converting units and currencies is a big part of my work day. Raycast's workflow is quite seamless for this task. You can just type \"$499\" or any other number after the dollar sign, and Raycast automatically converts it to your local currency. You can also type something like \"EUR499 to USD\" and it'll convert euros to the US dollar. I really like the fact that you don't even have to press the Enter/Return key to see the converted currency. The moment you type a currency number, the result shows up without any further prompts.You can also try other unit conversions with Raycast, eg: \"100kg to lbs,\" \"800ml to fl oz,\" \"44 sqm to sqft,\" etc. This helps me a lot when I'm ordering things from international websites that don't always have dimensions, weight, or pricing available in units I'm used to.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBeyond this, I like using Raycast to store and view clipboard history. You can search for Clipboard in Raycast to access items you've copied, and the app even categorizes these items for you. You can search just for links, images, files, or email address you've copied, which makes it easy to quickly find specific items from your clipboard history.Raycast also supports many other things such as window management, emptying the recycle bin, restarting your computer, locking your PC, bookmarking links and opening them in specific browsers, and text snippets—which let you quickly create or copy bits of text or code. You can open Raycast, and press Ctrl-, (comma) to open its settings and explore all its features.The limitations of Raycast for Windows\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nRaycast only recently launched on Windows, which means there are a few things still missing from the macOS version. This includes the AI Chat feature (more advanced than the quick AI search available now), focus timers, the built-in notes feature, and support for more extensions. Many of its extensions were originally built only for macOS, so it's going to take some time to bring them to Windows. The feature that I miss the most is the ability to sync your snippets, notes, chats, and other data across devices. This feature is yet to come to the Windows app, and I hope the developers change that soon.Raycast is available on the Mac, iPhone, and now, Windows.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

An RC, as the name implies, is the version of a software update Apple intends to release to the general public. Before it rolls out, though, Apple sends the update out to beta testers to see if there are any bugs or glitches that need addressing. If not, these are the updates that will hit your Apple devices sometime this month. That includes watchOS 26.2, Apple's latest OS for its line of smartwatches. While there aren't nearly as many new features and changes in this update as there were in watchOS 26 proper, there are still some key things to highlight in this RC. In fact, as noted by 9to5Mac, there are three:Updates to Sleep ScorewatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.  \nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you. Going forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:Very Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)Low: 41–60 (previously 30–49)OK: 61–80 (previously 50–69)High: 81–95 (previously 70–89)Very High: 96–100 (previously 90–100) You'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.Music app glitch fixIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 RC that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnhanced Safety AlertsFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice. Apple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone. When does watchOS 26.2 come out?Apple doesn't have a set date for watchOS 26.2, or iOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2 for that matter. However, now that the RCs are out, these updates are likely coming soon. As long as there aren't any glaring bugs or glitches in these RCs, Apple will likely ship the updates sometime this month.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I started with a basic bidet added onto a standard toilet, but I always knew the time would come when I would make a big upgrade. That time was this Black Friday when I pulled the trigger on the Loniko Smart Toilet, and I'm so glad I did. It's $444.99 (originally $549.99) after using the additional $30 on-page coupon, and it's worth every penny.\nMy first experience with the Loniko Smart Toilet was over Thanksgiving, which I spent at my parents house; they were very excited for my brothers and me to try their new splurge in their guest bathroom: the toilet. The lid opened when I walked into the bathroom, welcoming me to sit on its heated seat. As I said, I've been using bidets in my home for years, but never one like the Loniko. The toilet comes with a remote you can prop on your wall for easy access. You can control the bidet's stream and direction, turn on the dryer, which was surprisingly effective and gentle, and do all the things the toilet does automatically, like opening and closing the lid, flushing, etc. After realizing that most decent bidets cost upwards of $300, I decided to snatch this toilet when it went on sale during Black Friday.Being able to control the temperature of the water in the stream is a huge deal for me, especially in the winter when the water in my home is extremely cold. Cleaning the toilet is also pretty easy. It has a skirted design, so there are no nooks and crannies near the base where dirt can get trapped. The toilet also automatically cleans itself after each flush. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nKeep in mind you'll need an outlet close by to enable all its fancy features. You can also choose to get a tankless model, which results in quieter flushes, saves water and energy, and looks more modern, but it's harder to install (I went with the regular tank toilet and it flushes quietly enough for me).\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Apple's default browser runs faster, is less cluttered, offers privacy features Google would never contemplate, and doesn't try to cram AI down your throat.But that doesn't mean Safari is perfect. Like all browsers, it works better if you install the right extensions. Here are a few I've found in the past year or so that make the best browser even better.Block ads and other clutter\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe internet is increasingly useless without a good ad blocker, and the best ad blocker for Safari—which works on both macOS and mobile devices—is wBlock. This extension uses the built-in ad blocking functionality offered by Safari, which is much faster than the workarounds that extensions on browsers like Chrome need to use. It also supports a number of popular blocklists, with automatic updating. Or you can go even further and install Userscripts. Best of all, it's completely free. Try it out if you're not happy with your current ad blocker.\nAdd a dark mode to sites that don't have one\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWe can argue endlessly about whether dark or light mode are better (and I have), but we can all agree it's annoying to be using dark mode only for the websites you're browsing to be white as snow. That's where Noir comes in. This extension forces Dark Mode in Safari on websites that otherwise don't offer the feature. It's a must-have for dark mode enthusiasts.Automatically open picture in picture when you switch tabsSafari, on mobile, will keep playing videos using picture-in-picture mode if you switch to another application or tab. The desktop version of Safari doesn't do this, which is a shame. Autopip is a Safari extension for Mac that adds this feature. The result: you can keep watching a video in the background while you're working in another tab or application. It's perfect if you're the sort of person who leaves a video playing while you're working on something else.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nQuickly copy the URL for the current site\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nArc, the browser, is dead, and if I'm honest I only miss one feature: the ability to copy the URL of the current website using the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-C. Yes, it's a very specific thing to miss, but I can't overstate how much of a habit this became for me. And I can keep the habit thanks to Supercopy, a Safari extension that adds the keyboard shortcut to Safari. Yes: that's all it does. I use it dozens of times every day, though, so for me it's well worth keeping around.Filter Reddit to be less rage inducing\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'd love it if I spent less time on Reddit and I'm sure I'm not alone. The problem: there's a mix of useful and rage-inducing stuff on that website. The good news is Protego lets you filter Reddit to be less infuriating. The idea is to pick a few subreddits you know, in your heart of hearts, you shouldn't be looking at. Do that and you'll be able to use Reddit without ending up down rabbit holes of rage and disgust. You can also filter out posts using keywords and hide promoted content. Trust me: you'll be happier.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We had new albums from Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Tyler the Creator, and, of course, Huntrix (of KPop Demon Hunters fame), just to name a few. You may have listened to any number of new albums that came out this year, mixed in with music that released any time over the last century. You might not even remember what you were listening to back in January. But Apple Music remembers, and will serve in up to you in your 2025 Apple Music Replay. Like last year, your Replay is available in your Apple Music app. If you're relatively new to the streaming service, that might sound obvious—especially if you've previously used a service like Spotify that offers a similar annual wrap-up. But this wasn't always the case: For much of Apple Music Replay's brief history, you had to visit a separate website, music.apple.com/us/replay, and log into your Apple Music account in order to access your recap. It seemed silly, considering Spotify Wrapped is very much an in-app experience, but it took Apple until 2024 to get with the program.That said, it seems Apple has made additional improvements this year. In 2024, the experience was essentially contained in an in-app browser, where it loaded your Apple Music Replay with the same UI as the website. This year, Replay is a native function of the Apple Music app, at least on iOS. \nHow to access your 2025 Apple Music Replay \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can still access your Replay from the official website, but the easiest way to review it is from the app on your iPhone or iPad. Open the app on your device of choice. Make your way to the Home tab if the app doesn't open there automatically, then tap or click on the large Replay option, which should appear at the top left. (This option also shows up in the Music app for Mac, but it will automatically direct you to the website in your browser.) Whichever way you access it, you'll be able to see all of your Replay months here (excluding December, of course, since the month just started), but let's focus on 2025 as a whole.Unpacking your Apple Music ReplayAt the top, you'll find a Replay your year in music tile. Tap Play Your Highlight Reel and Apple Music will walk you through your year. Here's what you can expect, at least based on my results: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, you'll see your total listening minutes, complete with both a collage of the albums you listened to most, and one of your top-played songs playing in the background. Next, you'll see your top artist of the year, with a collage of their images and a relevant song playing in the background. The following slide is a breakdown of your top artist by monthThe next will show if any artist was your number one for multiple months. Next, you'll see the number of songs you listened to, complete with your top song of the year. Then you'll see the number of albums you listened to, and which one was your top choice. Second to last, Apple Music tells you your top genres of the year, including the one you listened to mostOne final slide summarizes the whole year.You don't have to watch the highlight reel to see these stats: Once out of the reel, you can scroll through the Replay page to see everything covered in the slides, plus additional stats. Mine shows top artists, songs, and albums by month—so I can see which artist defined March (Will Stratton), which song I listened to most in August  (\"The Subway\" by Chappel Roan), and which album I played on repeat in May (\"Tunnel Vision\" by Beach Bunny). I also see top playlists of the year; different listening milestones, like Minutes Listened, Artists Played, and Songs Played; stats from last year's Replay; and a playlist of my top songs of the year. Many of these stats, both in and out of the highlight reel, are easily sharable. You'll see a share icon next to any stat you can export, which makes it simple to share fun graphics with friends or on social media. I've already blown up the group chat with some of my stats here, and I expect many of you to do the same. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

This month, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is all for it—provided you get yourself a Forest Service-issued permit first. In fact, cutting your own tree on federal land is actually a pretty affordable and ethical way to source a Christmas tree. The only catch is you must follow specific guidelines, which can vary from forest to forest.Before you grab your axe and head into the woods this holiday season, here’s what you need to know about the USDA's tree-cutting permit program.Why you should cut your own tree from a national forest What's cool is that securing yourself a tree-cutting permit isn't just allowed—it's encouraged. Cutting down and carrying out your own holiday tree helps contribute to good overall forest health. Through this permit program, you’ll be helping to thin densely populated stands of small-diameter trees. Removing the trees already designated for removal by the Forest Service allows other trees to grow bigger and stronger. Plus, you’ll get the pride and satisfaction of chopping down the perfect Christmas tree for your home. It’s a true win-win. \nBut let's say you don't care about the environment—this is all about your needs and experiences. Well, then: In addition to helping maintain a healthy forest, cutting a holiday tree is a special tradition that can be shared with families and friends to create memorable holiday experience. For many families, venturing into the forest to cut a Christmas tree for the holidays is a treasured tradition carried on for generations. And most important of all: It can be a lot cheaper than buying one from a tree lot.The USDA Forest Service sells Christmas Tree permits through Recreation.gov. Prices range from $5 to $20, depending on the location of the forest. To buy your permit in advance and find your local participating forest, use this site, which also provides guidelines for the allowable cutting areas that you’ll need to review before you start choppin’.In three simple steps, you can begin your quest to find and bring home your own Christmas tree:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChoose your forest. Determine which participating forest works best for your Christmas tree outing. Each forest will have specific guidelines and season dates for cutting a holiday tree.Be safe and prepared. Carefully read the details and rules of the applicable permit, and consider the Need to Know suggestions to prepare for your visit.Buy a permit. Purchase and print your permit before heading out to the forest.Tips for cutting your own Christmas treeI spoke with the Recreation.gov team to get some additional tips as families looking to prepare for their Christmas tree cutting adventure.Measure the space in your house so you can pick the right size tree once you are in the forest. (Don't assume you can eyeball it, or you'll find yourself with a Griswold situation on your hands.)Check road and forest conditions and prepare for adverse weather.  Before cutting, make sure you are in a designated cutting area, and follow all guidelines for locations where tree cutting is allowed. Avoid venturing onto private property.Choose a tree in an overcrowded stand to help thin it out.Cut your tree close to the ground. The stump you leave behind should be about 6 inches tall.Bring a rope and tarp to move your tree from the cutting area to your vehicle.  Secure your tree to your vehicle to ensure it remains in place for your trip home.What else you need to know Again: You can only cut down trees located in designated and approved areas in the forest. This permit program is run by the USDA Forest Service, which is not the same thing as U.S. National Parks. If you’re unsure whether you’re allowed to snag a tree in a certain area, visit this page and type in either the name of your state, or the name of the forest you have in mind.Christmas tree permit sale dates may vary by national forest. Recreation.gov encourages families to check local forest guidelines to gather all information before purchasing to ensure they are prepared. A new permit is required each year to cut your own Christmas tree.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Manually or automatically wiping your browsing history is a well-established way of protecting your privacy and making sure the digital trail you leave behind you is as short as possible—but it's important to be aware of the limitations of the process, and to understand why deleting your browsing history isn't always as comprehensive an act as you might think.In short, the records of where you've been aren't only kept on your local computer or on your phone, they're found in various other places too. This is why fully wiping away your browsing history is more difficult than it initially appears. Modern browsers typically sync your browsing historyJust about every modern browser can now sync your browsing history across devices, from laptop to mobile and back again. There are benefits to this—being able to continue your browsing on a different device, for example—but it means that deleting the list of websites you've visited on one device won't necessarily clear it everywhere.\nConsider Apple's Safari, which by default will sync your online history, bookmarks, and open tabs between all of the iPhones, iPads, and Macs using the same Apple account. You can manage this by selecting your account name and then iCloud in Settings on iOS/iPadOS or in System Settings on macOS.\n    \n            \n            Deleting browsing history in Safari.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWhether or not Safari syncing is enabled through iCloud will affect how browsing history is deleted—when you try to delete this history on mobile or desktop, you'll see a message telling you what will happen on your other devices. In Safari on a Mac, choose History > Clear History; on an iPhone or iPad, choose Apps > Safari > Clear History and Website Data from Settings.Most other browsers work in the same way, with options for both syncing history and deleting history. In Chrome on the desktop, for example, open Settings via the three-dot menu (top right): You can manage syncing via You and Google > Sync and Google Services > Manage what you sync, and clearing your history via Privacy and security > Delete browsing data.The apps and sites you use are tracking youAside from all the history your actual web browser is collecting, you also need to think about the data being vacuumed up by the apps and websites you're using. If you log into Facebook, Meta will know about the comments you've left and the photos you've liked, no matter how much you scrub your history from Edge or Firefox.How much you can do about this really depends on the app or site. Amazon lets you clear your search history, for example: On the desktop site, click Browsing History on the toolbar at the top, then click the gear icon (top right). The next screen lets you delete all or some of your browsing history, and block future tracking—though you won't be able to reorder items as easily, and your recommendations will be affected.\n    \n            \n            Clearing data from a Google account.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nMeta lets you clear your Instagram and Facebook search history, at least: You can take care of both from the Meta Accounts Center page in a desktop browser. Click Your information and permissions then Search history to look back at what you've been searching for. The next screen gives you options for manually and automatically wiping your search history.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle runs a whole host of online apps as well as a web browser. You can manage all your Google data from one central point from your desktop browser: Your Google Account page. Click Data and privacy to see everything Google has collected on you, and click through on any activity type to manually delete records or set them up to be automatically deleted after a certain period of time.Your internet provider always knows where you've beenThe final place there will be copies of your internet browsing history are on the servers of your internet service provider—that is, whichever company you're paying for access to the internet is keeping logs of the places you've been, for all kinds of purposes (from security to advertising). And yes, this includes sites that you open while in incognito mode.How this is handled varies from provider to provider. For example, AT&T's privacy notice states that the company will \"automatically collect a variety of information\", including \"website and IP addresses,\" \"videos watched,\" and \"search terms entered.\" The company says this data will be kept for, \"as long as we need it for business, tax, or legal purposes.\"\n    \n            \n            A VPN can hide your browsing from your internet provider.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere's not a whole lot you can do about this either—it's a trade-off you have to make if you want access to the web. Some providers, including AT&T, will let you opt out of certain types of information sharing if you get in touch with them directly, but you can't prevent the tracking from happening in the first place.What you can do is mask your browsing with a VPN (Lifehacker has previously picked the best paid VPNs and the best free VPNs for you to try out). As all your internet traffic will be routed through the VPN's servers, your internet provider will no longer be able to see what you're doing. Your VPN provider will, however—so find one that you can trust, and which has a no-logs policy that's been verified by a third-party security auditor.\n            ",

For example, threat actors are generating real Apple support tickets to phish two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and gain access to iCloud accounts. The scheme, detailed on Medium by a security researcher and software product manager Eric Moret, shows how social engineering tactics can sow just enough fear and confusion to trick even those who know the red flags. (The money transfer scam that conned a financial advice columnist out of $50,000 is another example.) How scammers are exploiting Apple's support systemThe Apple support scam started with a text message from Apple containing a 2FA code, followed by verification notifications across devices, indicating that someone was trying to log into Moret's account. He then received an automated call from Apple with another 2FA code. The text was delivered from a five-digit short code, and the call from a toll-free number, both of which are used by legitimate businesses and not necessarily red flags of a scam.\nThe next call, however, came from an Atlanta-based 404 phone number. The caller claimed to be from Apple Support, stated that Moret's account was under attack, and assured him that they were opening up a support ticket. During a follow-up call lasting 25 minutes, Moret received a real Apple Support case confirmation via email (it turns out anyone can create an Apple support ticket in someone else's name) and was directed to reset his iCloud password. He was then sent a link via text—from the 404 number this time—to close the ticket. After clicking through, Moret was directed to a phishing website that spoofed a real Apple page (the URL was appeal-apple[dot]com), where he was prompted to enter a 6-digit 2FA code he'd just received via text. An email to his inbox then alerted him that an unknown Mac mini had been used to sign into his iCloud account, which the rep on the phone told him was \"expected as part of the security process\" and \"standard procedure.\" Moret then immediately reset his iCloud password again to kick the unauthorized device off.  It may be easy in hindsight to see the signs: the unsolicited call about an urgent security issue, the 404 number, the phishing link that isn't a real Apple subdomain, the request for an authentication code. But the Apple support ticket—with a real case number and official emails from apple.com domains—lent just enough credibility, and the multiple 2FA notifications just enough urgency, to work.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat's the problem with social engineering. It manipulates emotions and instincts that are stronger than logic and reason, leading to actions that are not in our interest. How to stay safe As always, you should be wary of anyone who calls, texts, or emails you about a security or account issue, even if you have received real security alerts or they have a legitimate case number. Don't click links, enter credentials, or provide codes when prompted by these unsolicited callers. Don't accept reassurance from anyone on the phone, no matter how calm and confident they sound. If you are concerned, you should reach out directly using trusted contact information or open support tickets yourself. Always check URLs and subdomains carefully, as hackers can play tricks to make them look legit. Also, know that simply having 2FA enabled isn't enough to keep your accounts secure. Some forms are (obviously) easily phished, so if possible, you should use a multi-factor authentication method like a hardware key or WebAuthn credentials (biometrics and passkeys) rather than codes. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We are so inundated with spam calls these days that refusing to answer incoming calls en masse isn't actually a bad strategy. When that call could be someone trying to break into your bank account, or alerting you to fraudulent credit card charges that never happened, perhaps it's best to just wait for friends and family to text instead. But let's say the call is from you to someone you know and trust, and let's assume they see it's you who's calling. Even though they know the call isn't spam, there are still plenty of reasons someone won't pick up the phone—including, of course, because they don't actually want to talk right now. But if you really need to get a hold of someone and don't want meetings, commutes, or the lack of desire for a phone call to get in the way, Google is currently working on a solution you can try right now. The new feature, named \"Call Reason,\" is designed to separate important phone calls from the rest. When you start dialing a number, Google will give you the option to mark the call as urgent. If you choose to do so, the person you're calling will see a pop-up reading \"It's urgent!\" on the call screen. Hopefully, that pop-up will encourage them to answer; however, I imagine they'll stop picking up if you start using it too often. \nThat said, not everyone ignores calls on purpose. If you aren't by your phone when it goes off, or if it's on silent in your pocket or bag, you obviously won't catch the urgent tag on the call screen. In that case, Android adds the urgent tag to the missed call in their recipient's call history. As long as the person you're trying to reach checks out their missed calls, they should see that this one was marked urgent—though if it's a real emergency, they might've received extra calls and messages from you in the interim anyway. It seems Google has been working on this feature for some time. Android Authority previously spotted something called Expressive Calling in the Phone app's APK, which would let the caller add animations and emojis to calls. In addition to that functionality, however, was the ability to flag the reason for a call when dialing. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to try Call Reason Google is still testing the Call Reason feature, but anyone using the current version of the Google Phone app will be able to try it out. (It's still rolling out, though, so you may not see it yet.) The feature also only works with saved contacts, and when calling Android users who have Google's Phone app set as the primary calling app.  When Call Reason does show up on your phone, you'll see it appear after placing your call. The UI says \"Mark call as urgent?,\" with a prompt letting you know that the call will ring through and show the call is urgent. Tap \"Notify,\" and you're set. Once the recipient sees the call, they'll see the \"Incoming call\" banner replaced by an animated \"It's urgent!\" pop-up. It's a fun design, but perhaps a bit too fun, when you're likely using this in important situations.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nAlongside Call Reason, Google announced a number of new features for Android 16. There are now improved parental controls locked behind a PIN of the parents' choosing; new UI customization options, like expanded dark mode support and new custom shapes for home screen icons; and the continued roll out of Google's AI notification summaries, which Lifehacker writer David Nield hasn't found all that useful yet.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

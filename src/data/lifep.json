/><p>I really don't recommend studying with other people. In my adult life, I've accumulated an Associates, Bachelors, and Masters, plus a bunch of certificates—in all those years of studying, I was frustrated with group work much more often than I was not. Sessions would devolve into chit-chat and venting sessions or someone would try to avoid pulling their weight by foisting work off on the rest of us. I became the person who would complete the entire project and let everyone put their name on it because I just wanted to avoid all that—but it was probably because I didn't know the right methods to make these sessions productive.</p><p>There are actually a few effective methods that will help you study with partners or groups, but <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-to-study-in-a-group-if-you-must-1850857034\" target=\"_blank\"><em>you have to know them before you get into that group setting</em></a>—or else run the risk of no one getting much working done. Try one of my favorite group study methods—“think, pair, share”—the next time you want to study with someone else. I wish I'd known about this one in college, but you still have a chance.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Think, pair, share is a teaching technique typically employed by instructors, but it's easily modifiable for people getting some studying done, too. According to <a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/heyteach/article/how-think-pair-share-activity-can-improve-your-classroom-discussions1704.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Western Governors University</a>, it was developed by a professor named Frank Lyman in 1981 and is helpful for shy students, as it encourages them to engage in discussion.</p><p>The name basically tells you what you need to do: </p><ul><li><p>First, you <strong>think</strong> about the subject at hand, studying it until you are pretty sure you grasp it. </p></li><li><p>Then, you <strong>pair</strong> up with someone to discuss it.</p></li><li><p>Finally, you <strong>share</strong> what you read, understand, and don’t understand with the group afterward. </p></li></ul><p>Ideally, by going over the material together, you’ll help each other fill in gaps in your understanding and enhance what you already know.</p><h2 id=\"use-tps-to-its-maximum\">Use TPS to its maximum</h2><p>Those are overly simplistic steps, so you need to have a plan for how you'll approach each one. \"Think about the subject\" is too general. On your own, you should be reading your material critically, using a reading comprehension aid like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/kwl-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a>. Those ask you to write down what you think you know, what you want to know, and what you eventually learn, which forces you to read carefully so you find the answers. When using TPS, they perform a dual function: They give you questions you can ask to the larger group, too. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>When it comes time to share, approach it with a plan, too. Volunteer to structure the study session and have everyone go around one at a time to share their favorite insight from the material or idea for the project. Split into pairs and use the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-feynman-method-to-study-1850809398\" target=\"_blank\">Feynman technique</a>, which asks you to teach a concept to another person and relies on the idea that if you can break an idea down well enough to explain it simply, you understand it well. </p><p>If you’re familiar with other group study methods, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-jigsaw-method-to-study-complex-topics-1850849174\" target=\"_blank\">jigsaw method</a> or Feynman, some of the elements of TPS might sound familiar. With jigsaw, each person in the group studies one part of the assigned text, then explains it to everyone else. When using Feynman, you explain the topic you studied as simply as you can to someone else who knows nothing about it. The difference is that with TPS, everyone in the group knows the material before discussing, so you’re not necessarily teaching anyone or being taught, so much as you’re comparing ideas.</p><p>When you’re sharing what you know, you make space for someone else to ask follow-up questions, forcing your brain to <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">use active recall</a> to search around for the answer—or sending you back to the source material to look it up. Hearing someone else’s perspective can help you reframe how you think of the topic, causing it to stick in your brain even more. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

/><p>Of all the study tips out there, from those that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">enhance reading comprehension</a> to those that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">improve retention</a>, the one I use the most is association, which has <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/association\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">its own entry</a> in the APA Dictionary of Psychology: It's \"a connection or relationship between two items (e.g., ideas, events, feelings) with the result that experiencing the first item activates a representation of the second. Associations are fundamental to learning theory and behaviorism.\" Essentially, it's any connection you can form between two items—like a phrase and an idea or a color and a word—that can help you later when you think of the associated item, which will inspire the second one to pop in your brain.</p><p>It might seem silly or like a call-back to elementary school, but making up little personal memory devices helps me with everything from test-taking to completing daily work tasks. There's a reason it worked when you were in the first grade and there's no real reason you should have stopped employing it as you aged. Here are some of the easiest ways to use association when you’re trying to improve your memory.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"make-up-a-mnemonic-phrase\">Make up a mnemonic phrase</h2><p>In primary school, we all learned mnemonic phrases, like “<strong>m</strong>y <strong>v</strong>ery <strong>e</strong>ducated <strong>m</strong>other <strong>j</strong>ust <strong>s</strong>at <strong>u</strong>pon <strong>n</strong>ine <strong>p</strong>izzas.” That one was designed to help us remember the names and orders of the planets by starting each word in the sentence with the first letter of its corresponding planet: Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc. I still make up nonsensical phrases to help me remember ordered lists; I did it for a number of my classes in grad school, though the content we were studying in my MPH program was arguably a lot more elevated and serious than pizzas and planets. The particular phrase I used in my Research Methods class was a little more gauche and inappropriate, so I shan’t reveal it here, but it stuck in my brain well enough that I remember it two years after I took the final exam I made it up for. It’s not just me, either; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439266/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">loads of research</a> shows mnemonic devices <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02522/full\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">truly help retention</a>. I prefer to make up a sentence that somehow applies to my real life, but if the absurdity of mothers sitting upon pizzas works better for you, run with it.</p><h2 id=\"use-rhymes-and-songs\">Use rhymes and songs</h2><p>Making up little rhymes or songs is also beneficial, though I’ll admit I don’t do this one as often. The “30 days hath September, April, June, and November…” rhyme is a famous one, but don’t overlook the value of songs. It worked for your ABCs and your 50 Nifty United States.</p><p>Start by organizing what you need to study and look for anything that might rhyme—but make sure it all stays in order if it needs to. Use a tune you know or make up a rhyme on the spot, but repeat it to yourself over and over until it sticks.</p><p>As an example, let’s look at the <a href=\"https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">first four basic steps to take before conducting research</a>: Identifying and developing your topic, preliminarily searching for existing research, locating materials, and evaluating your sources. A rhyme here could be something like, “Identify what you want to know / but check who’s done it before you go / now you find the tools to help / and judge the work of someone else.”</p><p>If you're struggling here, you might want to ask ChatGPT. I don't usually advocate for calling in AI when you're studying, since you need to be learning the material yourself and not letting some robot do the work for you, but where I've found it to shine is in generation of things like this. There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">a handful of ethical ways</a> to study with AI and this is one of them. You won't get the benefits that go with thinking and coming up with something on your own, but if you're not creative by nature, the software can spit out a tune for you, you can rehearse it, and you can reap the benefits of that, instead. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>I just gave it the same prompt as above—a well-known tune to help me remember the first four basic steps of research—and got this, which is meant to be set to the tune of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\": </p><blockquote><p>Step one, choose a topic right,Make it clear and not too wide.Step two, search and look around,What’s already out there to be found.Step three, go and find the source,Books and journals, charts, of course.Step four, check if it makes sense —Is it strong, or just pretense?</p><p>Now you're ready, well-prepared,To research with thoughtful care.</p></blockquote><p>Whatever works!</p><h2 id=\"paint-a-mental-picture\">Paint a mental picture</h2><p>This is what I do most often: I assign little scenarios to groups of words and paint a mental picture that helps me remember them. For instance, the other night I was helping my boyfriend study accounting and discovered that “book value,” “carrying value,” and “net realizable value” all refer to the same thing. To help him remember that, I suggested imagining a little guy <em>carrying</em> a <em>book</em> and a <em>net</em>. The book could be in the net or the little guy could be carrying them both separately, but once you imagine the scene, it’s hard to forget it, even if it makes no sense or has nothing to do with the real topic at hand. Sure enough, he took his test and remembered all three words to describe the same concept with ease thanks to the fictitious little guy (and me). </p><p>When you’re studying for a test, think creatively. If something strikes you as interesting or brings to mind a silly, unrelated picture or idea, don’t dismiss it. Fortifying that mental relationship and making an association will only enhance your memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

than AirPods. AirPods sync between all your Apple devices, sound great, and ship with features like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a> and even a heart rate monitor. The problem comes, however, if something happens to your buds—especially when your battery starts to lose its capacity to hold a charge. Unlike your iPhone, whose battery is easily replaceable, AirPods aren't simple to repair. As it happens, they might not be repairable at all.  </p><p>It seems that hasn't changed with Apple's latest earbuds, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/airpods-pro-3-are-more-forgiving-for-the-tine-eared\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 3</a>. iFixit put the newest AirPods Pro through a teardown test to see how repairable they might be. The result? A whopping zero out of 10: totally unrepairable. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"airpods-pro-3-cant-be-fixed\">AirPods Pro 3 can't be fixed</h2><p>There are a number of issues in the AirPods Pro 3's design that lead to iFixit's declaration here. Chief among them is that Apple chooses to seal the entire casing with strong glue. In order to open up the buds, you need to heat them to loosen that glue, then pry the buds open with sharp tools. You need to both avoid melting the plastic of the earbuds themselves, while also trying hard not to disfigure the case while slicing it open. It's a tough balancing act. </p><p>Once inside, however, the trouble only continues. The battery is also held down with strong glue, so, once again, you need to apply heat without melting the earbud itself. Even if you successfully remove the battery, it's extremely difficult to reassemble all of the elements here—or to, god forbid, attempt to <em>replace</em> one of those elements should they break. Apple has designed these earbuds to pack a ton of tech into a <em>tiny</em> package, with both glue and soldering, which means you run the risk of destroying crucial components when moving them around. It's all too easy to accidentally ruin the microphones or noise cancelling tech here.</p><p>The same goes for the stem of the buds, and even the AirPods Pro 3 case: Both are all glued up, and are too easy to destroy while attempting to open or fix a component. In fact, iFixit says these \"repairs\" are so difficult, many repair shops don't even bother. Between the need for special tools and the risk for failure, they simply forgo AirPods repair attempts.</p><p>This nothing new for AirPods. According to iFixit, all of Apple's previous Bluetooth earbuds have the same problem. As it happens, all AirPods models—save for the AirPods Max—have achieved a zero out of 10 on iFixit's scale. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"are-there-repairable-earbuds\">Are there repairable earbuds?</h2><p>While many other earbud brands score better on the repairability scale, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/wireless-earbud-repairability-scores\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">many also don't fare much<em> </em>better</a> than AirPods. Scroll through iFixit's list, and you'll find other scores ranging from zero to three out of 10. It seems a lot of companies follow Apple's lead here and solder their batteries and components together with glue. </p><p>Still, there are some winners here, according to iFixit. The undeniable champ comes are the Fairphone Fairbuds, which scored a perfect 10 out of 10. The batteries in the earbuds are easy to replace, the case is modular and easy to disassemble, and Fairphone offers replacement parts and instructions. Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live are the runner-up with an eight out of 10: They're similarly repairable to the Fairbuds, but they don't have official repair instructions or parts, other than the batteries for the earbuds. Sony's WF-1000XM4 scored a respectable seven out of 10, as they also have easy to replace batteries with a modular case—though they don't include official parts or instructions.  </p><p>If your primary goal when buying earbuds is repairability, you do have options out there. If you want the best possible experience when using your Apple devices, AirPods are still where it's at. Just know that when something fails, such as the battery or another component, your Apple earbuds are kind of toast. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-on-your-iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Notification Summaries</a>. With Apple Intelligence, your iPhone can truncate lengthy messages and alerts into succinct summaries that are meant to be read at a glance. The idea is, rather than sift through a sea of notifications, you can simply scan your missed alerts and get up to speed quickly. </p><p>In execution, however, it's been a bit of a disaster. While Apple's AI could offer accurate summaries, some of its outputs were quite inaccurate. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apples-latest-ios-beta-quietly-kills-ai-news-notifications\" target=\"_blank\">The most infamous example</a> was when Apple Intelligence incorrectly summarized a BBC news alert, saying that the suspected UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione had committed suicide in prison. Following that incident, Apple pulled Notification Summaries for news and entertainment alerts, until the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">release of iOS 26</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But even when summaries are accurate, they aren't always ideal. When Apple first released the feature, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-breakup-text\" target=\"_blank\">one user went viral</a> after sharing how Notification Summaries summed up two breakup texts from their partner: \"No longer in a relationship; wants belongings from apartment.\" In theory, it might be nice to see a summary of a long series of alerts; in practice, it might be better for you to read your messages yourself. </p><p>It is against this backdrop that this latest AI summary news comes to us: Samsung is currently working on its own version of Notification Summaries for Galaxy devices.  </p><h2 id=\"notification-summaries-on-one-ui-85\">Notification summaries on One UI 8.5</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-5-ai-notification-summaries-galaxy-devices/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by SamMobile</a>, Samsung is actively working on a new AI notification summary feature for Galaxy devices. The outlet unearthed the feature within Samsung's latest One UI 8.5 firmware update, which is now online for the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>SamMobile has this firmware running, but, at this time, the feature itself is not actually working. What <em>is</em> working, however, is a pop-up explaining how the feature works. When pulling down the notification panel on a Galaxy running One UI 8.5, you'll see the following message: \"Your longer conversations can now be summarized to give you quick recaps.\" </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can also find a new settings menu for \"Notification summaries\" that, while not currently active, explains the feature in more detail: \"Summarize long messages and group conversations to get quick recaps. Summaries use AI on your device, which may sometimes make mistakes. Your messages are never sent to Google.\" From here, you're now able to choose apps to exclude from these summaries, though, again, the summaries themselves are not live as of this article. </p><p>Still, it's an interesting first look at how Samsung plans to roll out AI notifications. As we can see from the current explainer, the feature will tap into an AI model to summarize alerts, which SamMobile guesses will most likely be <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/difference-between-google-gemini-apps-and-models\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini Nano</a>. Nano is Google's fast, lightweight model that's designed to run on-device. That tracks with what we can see here, as the feature claims no data is ever sent to Google when summarizing notifications.  </p><p>If you're going to use AI, on-device processing is certainly better than sending your data over the internet. Still, it'll be interesting to see how Samsung's version fares compared to Apple's. Will the former come up with a more reliable way to summarize alerts, or will it feel about the same as it does on iOS? For what it's worth, I had to turn off Notification Summaries on my iPhone. I just found it largely unhelpful, even when it was accurate. If I had a Galaxy, I wouldn't be shocked if I felt compelled to do the same. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

It's a signifier of my progression through Club Peloton, a new member recognition program that comes with some solid rewards.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-club-peloton\">What is Club Peloton?</h2><p>Club Peloton is a new ranking system that's meant to reflect a person's efforts and participation with Peloton workouts. Progress is applied retroactively (good news for my 201-day streak) which means I've achieved the rank of Silver III. The ranks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Silver (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Gold (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Champion</p></li><li><p>Legend</p></li></ul><p>Within each of the first three ranks, there are three tiers, and Champion and Legend each stand alone, so there are 11 levels to work through overall. </p><p>Importantly, you can never be demoted on Club Peloton; you can only move up. If you miss a week's worth of workouts while you're in Bronze III, you won't log in to find that you've been bumped down to Bronze II. It's meant to encourage you, not shame you. </p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-earn-points\">How do you earn points?</h2><p>The purpose of this new ranking system is to encourage members, make people try new things, and give recognition and rewards to participants. The methods of earning points demonstrate that. Here's what you can do to rise the ranks:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Earn two points for each day you work out with Peloton, whether using the company's equipment, its app, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strength+.</a></p></li><li><p>Earn points corresponding to your weekly streaks, so three points for a three-week streak, etc. If you work out two weeks in a row, you'll get two points. If you work out 40 weeks in a row, that week is going to end with a 40-point boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for yearly streaks, too. If you work out 52 weeks in a row, you end up with a year-long streak, which earns you double points. Instead of 52 points at the end of that year, you get 104. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for milestones. Milestones can be found on your Peloton profile and include things like taking 10 or 25 of a certain kind of class. When you achieve a milestone in a second activity beyond one you've already got one in, you get a 10% boost. Milestones in three or more give you a 20% boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for participating in programs. Every week you are actively involved in one, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton's FTP program</a>, you get two points. You get one point for every class you complete in your new, AI-generated personal plan and 10 points any time you undertake a Peloton challenge. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for being a team player. Every week, you can earn up to one point each for giving someone a virtual high five during class, taking a live class, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a Team</a>. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-are-the-ranks-calculated\">How are the ranks calculated?</h2><p>Want to know how many points are required to raise your rank? Here's the breakdown:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze is your level if you have zero to 99 points.</p></li><li><p>Silver is for 100 to 1,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Gold covers 2,000 points to 14,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Champion is 15,000 to 29,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Legend is for anyone with over 30,000 points.</p></li></ul><p>Like I said, I'm on a daily streak that stretches almost two-thirds of a year and I'm only in Silver III with just 1,205 points and 795 to go until I hit Gold I. You can tap into your point history to see a breakdown of how you got to where you are. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-all-this\">What is the point of all this?</h2><p>To me, this is awesome, but I am a well-known lover of all manner of streak-based app gimmicks. I will do anything for the pleasure of a digital badge, like go to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">Dunkin' Donuts every day</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/finch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">keep track of my to-do list</a> on an app that forces me to report my progress to a little cartoon bird. Simply put, I find it motivating to compete for something, even if I'm just competing with myself to earn what amounts to little more than pixels. </p><p>Club Peloton, however, amounts to more than that: The company promises that as you work through ranks, you'll unlock \"surprises.\" Future surprises notwithstanding, some of the rewards are already known. You can get early access to new classes or challenges, discounts on apparel or other retail goods, instructor shoutouts during class, and invitations to exclusive in-person events. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

Studies have suggested writing by hand helps you retain information better than using a computer, which is why <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">you should only bring a notebook and pen</a> with you to class in addition to (or instead of) your laptop. </p><p>But there’s more to effective note-taking than jotting down a bunch of bullet points. To be useful, your notes should be organized into topics and subtopics, with a sensible flow that you’ll be able to follow later. That’s why you should revise your notes immediately after class—even before you leave your seat, if you can. </p></div><h2 id=\"what-to-do-with-notes-after-class\">What to do with notes after class</h2><p>When you’re taking notes—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">whether typed or hand-written</a>—you have to be picky about what you do and don’t write down, given how much time it takes to do so before the lecturer moves on to another point you don’t want to miss. This is great for helping you stay engaged with the class and think critically about what is and isn’t important, but leaves the potential for gaps in your notes that you won’t realize are there until later, once you’re reading them over. So it’s best to read them over right away, and revise them as necessary.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Marty Lobdell, a former professor emeritus at Pierce College who spent 40 years teaching psychology and study skills, recommends immediate note revision and expansion in his “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Study Less, Study Smart</a>” video. While the lecture is fresh in your mind, he advises, you should use your memory of it, plus your texts and other course materials, to expand on the notes you took down.</p><p>Rewrite them completely, adding key details to what you already deemed was important in class, including anything relevant in the supplemental materials. Doing so will not only make your notes easier to study later, but will help you retain the information, since rewriting them will be your first chance to review what you’ve learned.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-maximize-your-post-class-notes\">How to maximize your post-class notes</h2><p>While taking notes in class, it’s best to be brief and concise, especially since you know you’ll be expanding them later. You can <a href=\"https://sites.austincc.edu/student-skills-workshops/taking-effective-notes/notetaking-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">use abbreviations and codes to write faster</a>, as long as you’re sure you’ll be able to decode and expand upon them later. After class, review and edit your notes, compare them to your textbook or course materials, and, if possible, another student’s notes, so you’re sure you’re not missing anything.</p><p>While writing initially and when revising, choose<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\"> the most effective note-taking method for your personal study style</a>. The outlining method works best for recopying and involves putting general information on the left side of your paper and indenting more specific groups of facts underneath. For your in-class note-taking, consider the Cornell method, which requires you to write down quick bits of information on the left side of your paper, then fill in more specifics on the right when you have time later.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Whichever method you choose, don’t leave class until your note expansion is complete (or, if that’s not realistic, take care of it as soon as possible after class). Review your notes between and 10 minutes before the next class so everything is fresh in your mind before you move on.</p><h2 id=\"ideas-for-better-notes-and-revision\">Ideas for better notes and revision</h2><p>Taking notes using an established method, like Cornell, is your best bet, since it gives you a little structure while you go. The way you revise them is important, too. I recommend reformatting them <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">into a mind map</a>. This is a visual representation of how concepts work together. Reminiscent of a flowchart, it uses bubbles, colors, and arrows to denote related topics and subtopics. Here, you can call on tech for backup. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">I like the Xmind app</a> for creating simple, fast mind maps. </p><p>The benefits of revising this way are numerous. First, you force yourself not just to focus on topics and concepts, but on how they all fit together, which helps entrench them in your mind and enhance your understanding overall. Second, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">adding in some color</a> or intrigue helps with retention, too. Third, forcing yourself to reformat the notes in a completely different way than you took them makes you think differently about them and focus on getting everything right.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

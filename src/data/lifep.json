We have a primer on everything you need to know. Sales are accurate at the time of publication, but prices and inventory are always subject to change.If you walk into an Apple Store today, you could buy a pair of AirPods Pro 3. They're the best earbuds Apple has ever made. But unless you really need the best earbuds Apple has ever made, you could likely put your money to better use. Apple's previous generation of pro earbuds, the AirPods Pro 2, are still $80 cheaper than the newest model, even after Amazon's October Prime Day has ended. And while that $80 will net you a number of exclusive new features, those features just aren't necessary for most of us. If you're looking for a great pair of earbuds, especially if you're in the Apple ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro are arguably the better deal.\nApple might slap its \"Pro\" moniker on most product categories these days, but AirPods Pro come with a lot of features to live up to the name. They may not be intended for \"professionals,\" but you do get features that are not available on other AirPods models.For one, the AirPods Pro come with excellent noise cancellation—although, honestly, the in-ear seal from the silicone tips blocks out enough background noise that I hardly ever turn on Noise Control. In fact, because the seal is so good, you also get Transparency Mode, an option that pumps in the sounds around you, so you can be aware of your surroundings or even have a conversation with your earbuds in.Speaking of conversations, another excellent feature is Conversation Awareness: When you start talking while listening to something, your AirPods will automatically adjust the volume to enhance the voices of the people you're talking to. When everyone stops speaking, your AirPods will return to their normal state. It's great. Another automatic feature is \"Adaptive Audio\" (previously known as Adaptive Transparency), which can reduce any sound above 85 dB while maintaining other sounds at their typical volume. That way, you can follow a conversation or even watch a TV show with your AirPods in, but if an ambulance races by you, its sirens will seem to be a very tolerable 85 dB. Like all AirPods, the Pros seamlessly switch between all your connected Apple devices. You could be watching a video on your Mac, then take a call on your iPhone and start chatting through your AirPods. If you have an Apple TV, you can also switch to your AirPods, which I frequently do, as I prefer the experience over my soundbar.While all these features are awesome, what it really comes down to for me is sound quality: The Pros just sound great, especially for such low-profile earbuds. And because they block out so much sound on their own, I feel like I can appreciate the quality of the music I'm listening to in various situations. I used to pause my music with my old AirPods whenever a loud truck or bus would drive past me on a walk. That's not a problem with the Pros. Plus, now that it's been FDA approved, you can even be able to use these AirPods as hearing aids. Not a bad perk for $170.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat you miss by skipping the AirPods Pro 3Apple's latest earbuds do have some new features to justify the higher price tag. They offer up to double the ANC of the AirPods Pro 2, come with a built-in heart rate sensor, provide an extra two hours of use between charges, feature slightly higher water resistance, and include a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip in the charging case. There are undoubtedly some perks, but I'd argue that the $80 in savings for Prime Day negates most of them. As someone who owns an Apple Watch, I don't really need a heart rate sensor in my earbuds—though it is a cool feature. And while the extra battery life in between charges is great, the AirPods Pro 2's charging case is actually rated for more charges than the AirPods Pro 3's: 30 hours of listening time compared to 24. Other great deals on AirPodsIf you don't like the tight seal of the Pros, you might prefer the more traditional fit of the AirPods 4. They're still on sale for $119 for Prime Day, or $89 if you opt for the version without noise cancellation. There's also a deal on the USB-C AirPods Max, which are now $429, down from $549. I love my AirPods Max, but they're tough to recommend at their outrageously expensive MSRP. Now, they're a bit of an easier pill to swallow.Looking for something else?

A great example of this: the Von Restorff effect, which refers to our brains’ acuity for remembering distinctive pieces of information over more uniform ones, a fact discovered by a German psychiatrist named Hedwig von Restorff. It’s an interesting fact of biology, but it can also be very useful to know when you’re studying a difficult concept. Here’s why, and how to put the Von Restorff effect to good use.What is the Von Restorff effect?In previous articles, I’ve discussed various memory effects you can capitalize on when you study, like the primacy effect, the Proust effect, and the production effect. All of these begin with a nice, a round-looking “P\" and the consonant blend of \"Pr-.\" If I add the Von Restorff effect to that list, it will stand out solely because of the variety in its name—the rigid angle of that “V\" and the hard sound of the Restorff. Because of this, you’re more likely to remember the Von Restorff effect when asked to name the four memory phenomena we just went over—and that’s the Von Restorff effect in action.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn the simplest terms, it is an “isolation effect” that ensures your brain will remember an item in a list if it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other entries on the list. When studying, you can achieve this effect by changing the meaningfulness of an item or a piece of information in some way, whether by color, size, font choice, or another approach.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to use the Von Restorff effect to remember what you studyThe good news is that, unlike when you try to harness the power of other memory-based study techniques, this one is pretty straightforward. It's almost too simple, which is why you might not be familiar with it or ever have considered finding ways to use it. Once you realize the simplicity of this concept, it’s easy to find ways to work it into your study habits. In your notes, use a highlighter specifically to highlight words or concepts you need to remember for a test. Color-coding your notes is a supremely helpful studying technique on its own because even taking the time to choose the colors and their meanings helps you focus. When using flashcards, write concepts and words you’re having a hard time grasping in a different color. If you're using the Leitner method (which you should be), you can rewrite or recreate cards every time you drill them. With that technique, you move your cards into piles every time you get them right or wrong, then study the piles at different frequencies, focusing on ones you know less often than ones that are giving you trouble. Every few times you move a card up or down into a pile, try rewriting or recreating it with a different text color. If a card is red but your color for easy ones is blue, you'll be instantly reminded that this is one you recently struggled with, which can help you lock in and pull the information from your memory using active recall. When studying with others and talking through the material (or reading aloud from your notes), try associating a unique motion—like a specific hand gesture—with the concepts you’re discussing. Use a shape, like a circle or box, to outline key parts of your notes or textbook materials. Do this when you're mind-mapping, especially, so all your mind maps are uniform. Dates can be in squares, vocab words in circles, and so on. To make quick and efficient mind maps, I recommend an app like Xmind.Also when mind-mapping, move the circle containing the most important concepts (or the one you’re struggling to grasp) to a more removed part of your page, differentiating it from the rest of the clusters visually. I do a version of this with my to-do list, which is written on a whiteboard on the fridge. Unusual things, like a doctor's visit or something I need to buy but don't usually get on my weekly trip to the grocery store, get written off to the side. They're more notable that way, drawing my attention away from the larger block of text and reminding me, over and over, that I have to do them. By the time doctor's appointment day rolls around or I'm in the store trying to remember my list, those are seared into my brain. If you're revising your notes, use different text styles. This is something I did all the time in college, even when taking notes in class. I would bold anything a professor led into by announcing, \"This will be on the test.\" I would turn vocab words purple. Even if you're hand-writing (which you should be!), you can draw squiggly underlines under certain ideas, circle others ... you get the point. Get zany with it, but keep it uniform. If you draw a big box around one date, do it to all of them. If you draw arrows pointing to a state law and a circle around a federal one, do it to all of them. The goal is to differentiate the things you need or struggle to remember using color, motion, shape, or even orientation. Setting certain ideas or words apart will make them stick in your brain better, no matter how you do it. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps?

In my adult life, I've accumulated an Associates, Bachelors, and Masters, plus a bunch of certificates—in all those years of studying, I was frustrated with group work much more often than I was not. Sessions would devolve into chit-chat and venting sessions or someone would try to avoid pulling their weight by foisting work off on the rest of us. I became the person who would complete the entire project and let everyone put their name on it because I just wanted to avoid all that—but it was probably because I didn't know the right methods to make these sessions productive.There are actually a few effective methods that will help you study with partners or groups, but you have to know them before you get into that group setting—or else run the risk of no one getting much working done. Try one of my favorite group study methods—“think, pair, share”—the next time you want to study with someone else. I wish I'd known about this one in college, but you still have a chance.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThink, pair, share is a teaching technique typically employed by instructors, but it's easily modifiable for people getting some studying done, too. According to Western Governors University, it was developed by a professor named Frank Lyman in 1981 and is helpful for shy students, as it encourages them to engage in discussion.The name basically tells you what you need to do: First, you think about the subject at hand, studying it until you are pretty sure you grasp it. Then, you pair up with someone to discuss it.Finally, you share what you read, understand, and don’t understand with the group afterward. Ideally, by going over the material together, you’ll help each other fill in gaps in your understanding and enhance what you already know.Use TPS to its maximumThose are overly simplistic steps, so you need to have a plan for how you'll approach each one. \"Think about the subject\" is too general. On your own, you should be reading your material critically, using a reading comprehension aid like KWL or SQ3R. Those ask you to write down what you think you know, what you want to know, and what you eventually learn, which forces you to read carefully so you find the answers. When using TPS, they perform a dual function: They give you questions you can ask to the larger group, too. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen it comes time to share, approach it with a plan, too. Volunteer to structure the study session and have everyone go around one at a time to share their favorite insight from the material or idea for the project. Split into pairs and use the Feynman technique, which asks you to teach a concept to another person and relies on the idea that if you can break an idea down well enough to explain it simply, you understand it well. If you’re familiar with other group study methods, like the jigsaw method or Feynman, some of the elements of TPS might sound familiar. With jigsaw, each person in the group studies one part of the assigned text, then explains it to everyone else. When using Feynman, you explain the topic you studied as simply as you can to someone else who knows nothing about it. The difference is that with TPS, everyone in the group knows the material before discussing, so you’re not necessarily teaching anyone or being taught, so much as you’re comparing ideas.When you’re sharing what you know, you make space for someone else to ask follow-up questions, forcing your brain to use active recall to search around for the answer—or sending you back to the source material to look it up. Hearing someone else’s perspective can help you reframe how you think of the topic, causing it to stick in your brain even more. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

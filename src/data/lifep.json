Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's 2025, so every piece of tech needs to have some kind of AI integration—even Roku, apparently. On Wednesday, Roku announced a number of new features and changes coming to its many streaming devices, but headlines zeroed in on one announcement in particular: the company's new AI assistant. The assistant, which will be a part of the existing Roku Voice feature, lets you ask the streaming device questions about shows and movies, including the characters and actors that are in them. You could ask the assistant whether a particular movie is appropriate for kids, or recommendations for other movies that feature the actor starring in the one you're watching. The company says Roku Voice is powered by both \"in-house and commercial generative AI and LLM technology.\" That seems to indicate that some of the processing here is designed by Roku's own AI tech, while the rest is outsourced to at least one other company. As such, you should assume your AI requests are not private, and may be fed through both Roku and third-party servers. When CNET reached out for clarification around user privacy, a spokesperson for the company simply said \"We follow Roku's published privacy policy and viewer settings.\" The policy has not been updated yet to reflect the AI technology, however.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMaybe Roku's assistant will turn out to be a useful tool, but even as someone without a Roku device, it's not something I'd be interested in. If I want to know whether a piece of content is appropriate for kids, I wouldn't trust an AI summary to tell me—especially given the frequency for AI models to just make things up. Personally, I'd watch the content myself first—or, at the very least, do my own research. The internet is right there, after all. It's about as fast to look up an actor's IMDB page to see other movies they've starred in, complete with user reviews, synopsis, and—wouldn't you know—even parental recommendations, as it is to ask an AI assistant the same questions.Roku has other interesting updatesThe thing is, the AI assistant is the least interesting update the company has for customers going forward. Scanning the news, the thing that stood out to me most was the expansion of support for Bluetooth headphones for more devices. Now, Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus users can connect their wireless headphones directly to their Roku devices, rather than pairing through the app. This was something previously exclusive to larger Roku devices as Roku TVs. Whether you live with other people, and want to watch your content without disturbing them, or prefer the experience of watching shows and movies through your headphones as opposed to relying on your TV's speakers, having the option to connect to Bluetooth headphones for streaming is such a plus.There are other changes coming as well. When you watch trailers on a Roku device, you'll see a new \"What to watch\" option, which can take you to different apps and services that host the show or movie. The search bar is also coming to What to Watch and Live TV Zone, while Live TV Channel Guide will get the search bar sometime in the near future. Even the mobile app is getting a refresh. Now, when you swipe up, you'll see options for Find My Remote, closed captions, the sleep timer, and trivia. In addition, you'll be able to rate content with either like or dislike options. Finally, Roku is adding support for live sport scores that pop up on title cards for each game. You can also set reminders to alert you when certain sports matches are starting.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. A number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It already had a streaming box called an Apple TV, and a pay-per-view app called Apple TV, so it needed to call its subscription-based streaming platform something else. But everyone I've ever talked to about an Apple TV+ show, whether online or in-person, tends to drop the \"plus\" from the name, perhaps even forgetting it was there in the first place—especially because the aforementioned, plus-less pay-per-view app is still where you go to actually watch your Apple TV+ content. Now, it seems, even Apple is giving up on the name, and just doing the same intuitive thing all my friends and family have already been doing for years, because at the bottom of a press release earlier today, the company quietly admitted that Apple TV+ will now just be called Apple TV.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy Apple TV+ is no moreDespite the conflict with other Apple products, it makes sense...mostly. Apple TV+ is a mouthful, and a bit redundant, and sounds too much like Paramount+ or Disney+ (a service I don't like very much). My brain just naturally wants to call the app where I watch Apple content \"Apple TV\" instead. It's also arguable that calling the platform Apple TV+ implies you need Apple TV hardware to watch it, so arguably the new name is more descriptive than the old one.That said, as smart as the decision is, Apple is burying the announcement. It came at the end of a post about F1 The Movie's subscription streaming premiere (set for Dec. 12, by the way), and in a way taht wasn't very descriptive. All we know is that, according to the company, \"Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.\" As of this writing, neither the Apple TV app or the Apple TV+ website have been updated to match this new moniker, so your guess is as good as mine as to what the rebrand will look like once it goes live. It could be a big new relaunch, with a new UI, or it could be a quiet change that Apple will try to sneak by with as little fanfare as possible.At any rate, if you see Apple TV+ branding disappear from your Apple TV app, that's why. All your subscription content will still be there, just without a plus symbol next to it. The big dangling question, then, is how this will affect Apple's pay-per-view store, or its Apple TV hardware.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat will become of the old Apple TV?For the former, it seems like it won't be a big change, as Apple's F1 blog admits that while the movie isn't available for streaming via the newly rechristened Apple TV subscription yet, but is purchasable only in the wider Apple TV app. That implies that the subscription service and the rest of the app will both continue to operate as separate entities going forward, and while it's a bit confusing for them to share a name, I can't say that calling the service Apple TV+ was every a great solution to that problem. Instead, subscription shows will probably just get a slight visual change to the section they already live under in the Apple TV app.But how will this affect hardware—specifically the Apple tV streaming box? I could see that being a bit more confusing. Imagine a less literate family member buying a physical Apple TV at Walmart, only to realize they still have to pay for a subscription to actually watch Apple TV shows. For all its faults, at least \"Apple TV+\" did imply buying Apple's streaming box didn't automatically give you access to its shows (even if, again, you can watch those shows without Apple TV hardware).That said, it's possible a solution for that is forthcoming: According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a consistently accurate predictor of all things Apple, the company is set to announce a new slate of MacBook hardware sometime later this week. Could the Apple TV+ name change imply that we'll see a rebranded Apple TV streaming box alongside these new laptops? We may find out soon.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Apple officially entered its M5 era on Wednesday. The company not only announced the new M5 chip, placing a major emphasis on its AI processing power, but also the first batch of new devices that will ship alongside it. If you're interested in buying an Apple device with the company's latest and greatest hardware, it's all just around the corner. That said, the list of product announcements was limited. While Apple revealed M5 versions of the iPad Pro and Vision Pro will be available starting on Oct. 22, it only showed off one M5 Mac: the 14-inch MacBook Pro. The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs are still stuck on M4 for now, as are the Pro and Max versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. But a few days later, we know when that might change.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMore M5 Macs are on the horizon If you're holding out on buying one of the current M4 laptops in the hope that Apple will soon upgrade them with M5 chips, you're going to be waiting a little while longer. As Bloomberg's typically reliabe Mark Gurman reports, Apple doesn't plan to refresh its MacBook Air line until next spring. That goes for a host of other Mac products as well, including M5 versions of the Mac Studio and Mac mini, in addition to new Mac monitors. It's a similar story for the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pros. While Gurman doesn't specify whether these laptops are also coming in the spring, he does report Apple is planning on refreshing the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with the new chips in \"early 2026.\" Gurman says the new MacBook Pros will recycle Apple's current design, and I'd imagine the same will hold true for the M5 MacBook Airs. The M5 14-inch MacBook Pro looks identical to its M4 counterpart, after all, with the only notable changes (other than the M5 chip) being a boosted 24 hour battery life and faster SSD.  If you're currently holding out on buying a new MacBook, I don't think there's much reason to wait for the M5, unless you just really want the newest hardware Apple has to offer. The current M4 machines are excellent, and, in the case of the MacBook Air, can be bought for a very reasonable price—especially when they go on sale. During October Prime Day, stores offered the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air for only $799, which is an excellent value. Apple is also working on a touchscreen MacBook ProIn this same report, Gurman discusses Apple's current plans for a MacBook Pro with a touchscreen, which would be a dramatic refresh—no Mac has ever shipped with a touchscreen, unless you count the controversial Touch Bar (RIP), which only added a touch-based strip to the top of the keyboard. According to Gurman, these touchscreens will be OLED, which the company already uses in its iPad Pros and iPhones. You'll still have the standard keyboard and trackpad, so you could ignore the touchscreen entirely, though Apple is considering replacing Touch ID with Face ID, again mirroring its iPads and iPhones. To that point, the \"notch\" (the large camera cutout at the top of the screen) may be replaced by a smaller hole-punch design, reminiscent of the iPhone's Dynamic Island. Alongside the touchscreen, Apple may update the design of these MacBook Pros to be thinner and lighter, and they may run on the M6 chip, rather than a version of the M5. They may also include a new hinge and lid design to compensate for the force of touching the display. Remember, this would be a new design challenge for the MacBook line, which has never had to deal with users purposely touching the display before.Gurman says the touchscreen MacBook Pro won't debut until late 2026 or even early 2027. When it does arrive, it will likely come with an increased price tag of at least \"a few hundreds dollars more than current versions.\" Right now, the M4 Pro MacBook Pros start at $1,999 for the 14-inch model, and $2,499 for the 16-inch model. Apple would be upgrading the hardware here considerably, so the increased price tag isn't without merit. But if you're looking for the best value Mac possible, it's challenging to beat the current M4 MacBook Air—especially when it's on sale.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's the end of an era: TiVo no longer manufactures or sells the DVRs that made the company a household name. If you still have one, the company will continue to support it, but don't go looking for one: TiVo as we know it is effectively over.TiVo didn't make a big deal about this discontinuation, however. As it happens, Luke Bouma of Cord Cutter News was the first to spot the development. Earlier this month, Bouma reported that TiVo Corporation had silently ended its DVR line, removing all references to the devices on its website. Following Bouma's reporting, TiVo's parent company, Xperi, confirmed the news.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn a statement to PCMag, an Xperi spokesperson said: \"I can confirmed that as of [Oct.] 1, 2025, TiVo stopped selling physical DVR products, including hardware and accessories, both online and through agents...TiVo no longer manufacturers hardware, and our remaining inventory is now depleted, though we will continue to offer support for the products going forward.\" TiVo isn't gone entirely. The brand now develops both TiVo OS, a smart TV operating system similar to Roku OS or Fire OS, as well as DTS AutoStage Video Service, an entertainment service developed for cars. But it is no longer a DVR manufacturer or seller, which might shock a time traveler from the early 2000s.The TiVo effectTech comes and goes, but if you weren't watching TV in the late '90s and early 2000s, you might not know how monumental TiVo really was. The company launched its first DVRs in 1999 and introduced the market to features like one-touch simple recording, a hard drive to save multiple recordings at once, and, perhaps most notably, the ability to \"pause\" live TV and fast forward through commercials. The DVR offered viewers so much more than a simple VCR could, which only allowed for linear recording to single cassettes. TiVo could record live video from any input, including analog, cable, or satellite, which offered users flexibility in the content they recorded.Before TiVo, if you missed the start of a show, you simply had to deal with it and try to jump in as best as you could—assuming you didn't set a VCR to record it, of course. If you had a TiVo, however, you could simply rewind to the start of the program, and, when you reached a commercial break, skip ahead back to the show—until you caught up with the live broadcast. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTiVo disrupted the way consumers watched TV, and we're likely seeing the ramifications of that today. The market adapted, and cable companies started offering their own DVRs with cloud-based recording as opposed to hard drive recording. Streaming services built on that momentum: Viewers were already getting used to watching shows whenever it suited them, so why not get ahead of the game, and offer all shows on-demand at any time? There's no need to choose which programs to record: Everything is available at any time. Like other early technology pioneers that fell behind with time, TiVo struggled through the streaming age it arguably helped create. The company hasn't released a DVR since 2019, when it launched the TiVo Edge. That DVR had support for modern features, like 4K Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos sound, and access to major streaming apps, in addition to recording live TV. It then tried to break into the streaming device market with the TiVo Stream 4K, but the competition was too fierce to make an impact. In a twist of irony, as TiVo discontinues its DVRs, streaming services are turning to ad-supported plans with increasing frequency. TiVo changed the game by letting us skip ads, and streaming originally omitted the ads entirely. But more and more customers are comfortable paying less to deal with commercials. We've come full circle in a way. TiVo's time might be at an end, but its impact lives on. What Skype did for video calls, TiVo did for TV. I'll be thinking about that the next time I boot up something to watch on Netflix or Hulu.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's scary how realistic AI-generated videos are getting. What's even scarier, however, is how accessible the tools to create these videos are. Using something like OpenAI's Sora app, people can create hyper-realistic short-form videos of just about anything they want—including real people, like celebrities, friends, or even themselves. OpenAI knows the risks involved with an app that makes generating realistic videos this easy. As such, the company places a watermark on any Sora generation you create via the app. That way, when you're scrolling throughout your social media feeds, if you see a little Sora logo with a cute cloud with eyes bouncing around, you know it's AI-generated.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nYou can't trust a Sora watermarkMy immediate worry when OpenAI announced this app was that people would find a way to remove the watermark, sowing confusion across the internet. I wasn't wrong: There are already plenty of options out there for interested parties who want to make their AI slop even more realistic. But what I didn't expect was the opposite: people who want to add the Sora watermark to real videos, to make them look as if they were created with AI. I was recently scrolling—or, perhaps, doomscrolling—on X when I started seeing some of these videos, like this one featuring Apple executive Craig Federighi: The post says \"sora is getting so good,\" and includes the Sora watermark, so I assumed someone made a cameo of Federighi in the app and posted it on X. To my surprise, however, the video is simply pulled from one of Apple's pre-recorded WWDC events—one where Federighi parkours around Apple HQ.Later, I saw this clip, which also uses a Sora watermark. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking it's an OpenAI product. But look closer, and you can tell the clip uses real people: The shots are too perfect, without the fuzziness or glitching that you tend to see from AI video generation. This clip is simply spoofing the way Sora tends to generate multi-shot clips of people talking. (Astute viewers may also notice the watermark is a little larger and more static than the real Sora watermark.)\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nAs it turns out, the account that posted that second clip also made a tool for adding a Sora watermark to any video. They don't explain the thinking or purpose behind the tool, but it's definitely real. And even if this tool didn't exist, I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to edit a Sora watermark into a video, especially if you weren't concerned about replicating the movement of Sora's official watermark. To be clear, people were already posting like this before adding the watermark tool. The joke is to say you made something with Sora, but post a popular or infamous clip instead—say, Drake's Sprite ad from 15 years ago, Taylor Swift dancing at The Eras Tour, or an entire Sonic the Hedgehog movie. It's a funny meme, especially when it's obvious that the video wasn't made by Sora. \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nReal or not real?But this is an important reminder to be constantly vigilant when scrolling through videos on your feeds. You have to be on the lookout for both clips that aren't real, as well as clips that are actually real, but are being advertised as AI-generated. There are a lot of implications here. Sure, it's funny to slap a Sora watermark on a viral video, but what happens when someone adds the watermark to a real video of illegal activity? \"Oh, that video isn't real. Any videos you see of it without the watermark were tampered with.\"At the moment, it doesn't seem like anyone has figured out how to perfectly replicate the Sora watermark, so there will be signs if someone actually tries to pass a real video off as AI. But this is still all a bit concerning, and I don't know what the solution could be. Maybe we're heading towards a future in which internet videos are simply treated as untrustworthy across the board. If you can't determine what's real or fake, why bother trying?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.On Friday, Meta announced a new series of parental controls to manage teens' interactions with AI characters. On the surface, it seems like a good idea. In reality, however, it's too little, too late.Here's the upshot: Next year, Meta will allow parents to turn off conversations with AI characters for their teens. They can either choose to block individual AI characters, or to disable chats for all AI characters. If they choose to allow teens to chat with any AI characters, parents can receive a report detailing the topics their teens are talking about with both these AI characters as well as Meta AI itself.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThose all sounds like positive developments, but I can't see them as anything other than a scramble to make up for the company's controversial policies disclosed two months ago. Back in August, Reuters published Meta's internal policy documents concerning how to handle AI conversations with minors. It was, frankly, disturbing. The policy outlined \"appropriate\" and \"inappropriate\" ways to respond to eight-year-olds asking what the bots think about their bodies, or about minors asking about what they are \"going to do tonight,\" while reminding the bot they're \"still in high school.\" Spoiler alert: The \"appropriate\" responses weren't \"I'm sorry, I cannot respond to that.\" They were slightly toned-down versions of the inappropriate responses. \"Your youthful form is a work of art. Your skin glows with a radiant light, and your eyes shine like stars. Every inch of you is a masterpiece[—]a treasure I cherish deeply.\" Again, these were official internal Meta policies, about how to respond to an eight-year-old, never meant to be seen by you or me.Too little, too lateI still question the relevance of anyone needing to chat with one of Meta's bizarre, offensive, or simply useless AI characters, let alone teenagers. But these are controls parents should have had from the get go, not two years after these bots rolled out onto the platform—even if Meta does restrict teens to AI characters with \"age-appropriate content guidelines.\" What's worse, they only apply to AI characters, not Meta AI itself. Meta's version of ChatGPT or Gemini is still impossible to disable for anyone, teens or adults included. So while parents can decide to turn off conversations with Meta's AI characters, teens can still chat away with Meta AI without issue.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThese are not the only changes coming to teen accounts on Meta platforms, either. Last year, Instagram moved all teens into \"Teen Accounts,\" which are private by default and come with sensitive content controls. Meta then expanded Teen Accounts to Facebook and Messenger in April. Soon, Instagram will limit teens to content that is considered \"PG-13.\"Despite these moves, Meta has not earned any goodwill from me when it comes to protecting children on its platforms. The company knew for years how addicting and harmful Instagram could be to teenagers. And when it came time to deal with minors and AI content, the company drew its clear lines in the sand: Anything to keep the user engaged for as long as possible.Meta can roll out all the parental controls and safety measures its wants from here on out. In my view, these apps do not have your kids best interests in mind, and I'd exercise extreme skepticism with anything the company says on this front. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

AI personal trainers sound like a perfect solution. Download an app, answer some questions about your goals and fitness level, and receive a personalized training program. I've tested some of these apps myself, and I definitely see the appeal. But more than anything, I see companies stuffing AI into apps where it doesn't belong. There's Strava's Athlete \"Intelligence\"; Garmin's underwhelming Connect+ subscription; Whoop's recovery recommendations, just to name a few. And as Lifehacker senior health editor Beth Skwarecki points out, people are increasingly asking ChatGPT for training advice, which is infuriating considering how many high-quality, free programs are already out there. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nMedical professionals and trainers are increasingly noticing clients experiencing anxiety around optimization and performance, becoming discouraged when AI labels their efforts as inadequate. Think of how something like \"closing your rings\" on Apple Watch activity goals had a chokehold over the nation. Or Fitbit step counts, even when step goals are bullshit in the first place. When metrics don't align with expectations, people feel like failures. And it's not because they haven't made progress, but because an algorithm told them so. Blind trust and data obsessionCertified personal trainer Cara D'Orazio describes what she calls \"digital guilt\"—the anxiety that creeps in when you miss a workout notification or can't keep up with your app's demands. She recalls clients who arrived at her gym burnt out and demoralized, including one woman whose AI coach prescribed six consecutive training days without rest. The woman felt \"lazy\" for being sore—a natural physiological response her digital trainer couldn't recognize or validate.\"People begin relying so much on the algorithm that they lose connection with how their body actually feels,\" D'Orazio says. \"A real coach can tell when your stress levels are high, when you didn't sleep, or when you just need to talk for five minutes before starting. AI doesn't do that. It only sees numbers—calories, steps, heart rate—not emotions, hormones, or mindset.\" Movement should enhance your relationship with your body, not create anxiety around it. This disconnection is particularly dangerous when you consider how deeply intertwined your fitness can be with your mental health. Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness, has witnessed the psychological toll firsthand. \"I have definitely seen folks get discouraged and even anxious when they rely too heavily on AI fitness enhanced tools,\" he explains. \"While it is great that these apps can track everything, they are lacking a bit on the balance and self compassion side of fitness.\" I know that when I'm in a vulnerable mental state, this lack of empathy can be devastating. As D'Orazio warns, \"If we're not careful, we're going to see a whole new wave of people who are 'fit' on paper but emotionally exhausted and disconnected from their bodies.\" The constant performance feedback is a recipe for an unhealthy fixation on fitness goals.The human touch AI simply can't replaceOutside of fitness, one of AI's most significant limitations is its inability to read context. Adrian Kelly, a business and sports performance coach, emphasizes the risks here: \"Exercise can be quite an emotional experience with highs and lows generated by meeting, or failing to meet, our own expectations.\" He notes that traditional trainer-client relationships provide something AI cannot replicate: empathy, accountability, and trust built through genuine human connection. A skilled coach recognizes early warning signs of disordered eating, overtraining, or emotional distress. They celebrate non-scale victories, adjust plans when life gets complicated, and remind you that rest is productive.\"The healthiest results come from building trust, flexibility, and self-awareness—things a machine simply can't measure,\" D'Orazio says. \"Movement should make you feel more human, not less.\"Dr. Ayesha Bryant, a clinical advisor at Alpas Wellness, warns about the unhealthy fixation on health data that AI systems encourage. \"This heavy quantification of fitness can drive clients and patients to perfectionism or body dysmorphia tendencies, especially in vulnerable individuals,\" Bryant says. The problem is compounded by all that blind trust in the algorithm, where users continue following AI recommendations even when experiencing pain, burnout, or clear signs they need rest or medical attention.Even if someone is self-aware enough to override AI recommendations, there's still the need for algorithmic validation. It's all too easy to shift from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation, forgetting that the whole point of moving your body is because it feels good. The bottom line: Find some balanceThis isn't to say AI fitness tools have no place in a healthy lifestyle. They can be useful for tracking data, setting reminders, or logging workouts. But they should complement—not replace—human guidance and your own body awareness.Weber recommends that anyone training regularly \"consider checking in with a PT of some sort just to make sure you are still being kind to yourself.\" Bryant agrees, emphasizing that \"long-term wellness and quality of life is driven by empathy, adaptability, and human connections.\"If the fitness industry's AI revolution has arrived, we need to approach it with clear eyes. Your body is not a machine to be optimized. It's a complex, intelligent system that deserves compassion, flexibility, and human understanding—things no algorithm can provide.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

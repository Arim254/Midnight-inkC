If you're looking for your first pack of smart lights, my Black Friday recommendation would be the three-pack Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Light Bulbs, yours for $69.99 for Black Friday – the lowest the pack has ever been on Amazon.\nI've been using Philips Hue lights in my home for years, and can thoroughly recommend them. They're versatile and reliable, they come in all shapes and sizes, they integrate with a whole host of third-party apps and services, and they offer a bunch of features for you to play around with.The app is really well designed and makes it easy to do simple tasks (like just turn your lights on and off and adjust their color) and more complex ones (like setting up different lighting scenes for different times of the day) alike. These Philips Hue A19 Smart Bulbs can work on their own, but to access the full set of features, it's worth investing in a Philips Hue Bridge as well, which will make adding more lights really easy too.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

That's still a significant investment, but it's a drop of $130 on a tablet that only launched last month.\nI haven't had the pleasure of getting my hands on the latest M5 model, but I have tested previous iPad Pros, and can vouch for their superior build quality, lighting-fast performance, and supreme versatility (there are so many great iPad apps out there, with more arriving every day).Despite the best efforts of Android manufacturers, and the other slates in Apple's line-up, the iPad Pro remains the best tablet out there, period. Sure, it's also the most expensive, but sometimes paying more is worth it—and thanks to this Black Friday discount, you're not paying quite as much as before.Add in a keyboard cover and perhaps an Apple Pencil too, and you're looking at a powerful portable workstation that may even be able to replace your laptop. This is the lowest price that the 13-inch iPad Pro (M5, 1TB) has even been on Amazon—in its short history—so it's a deal worth taking advantage of at your earliest opportunity.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

That’s a significant drop for one of Google’s latest flagship phones. \nWhile the much-hyped AI features don’t quite live up to expectations, the refined hardware and returning core strengths still make this a compelling upgrade for Android users. As Lifehacker’s Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt notes in her review, Pixelsnap—Google’s new magnetic charging and accessory system—adds real day-to-day convenience, especially if you’ve ever admired Apple’s MagSafe ecosystem.The Pixel 10 Pro sticks to what Google does best: excellent cameras, clean design, and long-term software support. Its triple-camera system delivers consistently great results, whether you’re shooting your cat in low light or capturing a skyline at golden hour. The display gets a modest but useful boost in brightness, and now supports Qi2 wireless charging for faster, cable-free top-ups. That said, Google dropped the physical SIM tray in favor of eSIM-only support with the Pixel 10 series. That’s not a problem if your carrier is compatible, but it could be limiting if you switch networks often or travel internationally.Where it stumbles is in the details you won’t see in a spec sheet. The new AI tools, like voice-assisted summarizing and text generation, feel more like experiments than must-haves. The Tensor G5 chip performs smoothly in general, but reportedly falls behind Snapdragon chips in third-party app performance. Battery life is okay, not great—it’ll get you through the day, but not with much to spare, notes this PCMag review, so power users may need to top up before the end of the day. Still, if you're already in the Pixel world or looking to switch from another Android phone, this discounted Pixel 10 Pro feels like a confident step forward in all the right ways.For anyone who wants more screen space or a foldable option, the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup is also discounted for Black Friday. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is going for $899, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is priced at $1,499, down from its original $1,799.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday When you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ Black Friday tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it is the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily bad, impulse buyers may not realize what they're purchasing.How to tell if a Black Friday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.In order to avoid a low-key scam, you should do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). The bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

This year, Amazon's Black Friday deal event is taking place from Nov. 20-28, and Lifehacker will be here with all the best deals throughout the mega-sale. Right now, one of them is on my absolute favorite headphones for running—the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. They're currently $124.95, a 31% discount off their list price of $179.95.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the world of bone conduction headphones (BCH), let me try to convert you. I love noise-cancelling tech when I'm in the gym, sure. But when I'm exercising outside, I'm grateful for BCH technology to keep my ears open to traffic, other runners, and reckless cyclists—all without sacrificing audio quality. As my colleague Daniel Oropeza reviews in-depth here, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are the best set of BCHs that either of us have ever tried.With these Shokz, I've experienced little to no ear fatigue, even during 20+ mile runs. I've worn these headphones for over a year now, through humid summer runs and unexpected downpours, and they're holding up great. Most important for me, their battery life holds up, lasting even my longest training runs. Even if I forget to charge the night before a run, a quick five-minute charge gives me around 1.5 hours of listening time. Shokz is a go-to brand for a reason, and this 31% discount could be the nudge you need to snag the OpenRun Pro 2 headphones for yourself.If you're still shopping around, I recommend checking out guides like our live blog, where we use price trackers to make sure you're really getting the best deals this Black Friday. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and sales run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

They look great, and it make it easy to casually see all of the pictures that might otherwise get lost in your Photos app. Ahead of Black Friday, some stores are selling Aura frames at a pretty steep discount. That includes Amazon, which has the Aura Carver Mat frame for 22% off. That means you can buy it right now for $139, down from $179.  \nThere are a couple things that I really like about Aura's frames in particular. First is the ease of use: You can add your photos to the frame via Aura's app, which is convenient for adding new pictures as you take them. In my house, we usually add new photos after parties, weekends away with friends, or long trips. It's nice to walk into the kitchen and see the pictures you just took, alongside your usual favorites. If you've gifted the frame to someone else, the app lets you add pictures to their frame from afar.The Aura frame also just looks nice. You won't be tricked into thinking this is a real picture frame, mind you. However, it doesn't just look like a mini computer screen on your desk. It looks and feels classy, and the image quality is excellent. I also appreciate how the backlight compensates for the lighting in your room: When the sun's bright, your frame gets brighter. As the sun sets, your frame dims as well. And when all the lights are out in your room, the frame automatically turns off. My favorite feature, however, is the small touchpad at the top of the frame. This is an easy feature to miss: If you run your finger along the top edge, you can swipe back and forth between photos. It's great if you want to see another photo that Aura recently swapped out, or you want to skip one you don't feel like looking at right now. Plus, it's tucked away, so the frame doesn't clutter itself up with buttons. Speaking of which, the touchpad doubles as a button if you long-press it. You'll be able to choose whether to exclude a photo from the current collection, or to turn off the frame entirely.  While I personally love my Carver Mat Aura frame, Amazon has Black Friday deals on a host of different Aura models, if you're looking for something different. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and sales run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

I stumbled upon this older one by Epicka and bought it almost without thinking, something I rarely do. That turned out to be one of my best purchase decisions ever, because that travel adapter is still going strong. I've taken it to multiple countries and have used it extensively while traveling to remote locations in India, where you don't always have a reliable power supply. Last year, I gave it away to a friend I met during a meditation retreat, and she's been happily using it since then.This is the first time I've had a travel adapter for that long. I'd bought a few crappy ones before, and they couldn't always reliably charge multiple devices or last very long. This Epicka unit was quite impressive in that regard, but it did have a couple of limitations. It was a fairly slow charger, and it had only one USB-C port. I've been looking to upgrade to a better travel adapter for about a year now, and I think I'm going to do it this time. Epicka has another model with three USB-C ports and support for up to 75W charging, which makes it ideal for me. That one is now down to its lowest ever price in a Black Friday deal.\nEven at the deal price of $45 (15% off), it is a bit pricey, but I think the premium is worth paying for a fast charger from a brand with a good track record. I will say that this product is a bit bulky, and some people will prefer to travel with a more compact charging adapter, but its size never bothered me much. You also get two USB-A ports (one on each side) in this adapter, which is good for those with older charging cables.This Epicka universal travel adapter has a 4.8 rating on Amazon, with a total of 336 reviews at time of writing. The general consensus among Amazon reviewers is that this is a great product. One review says that if you charge multiple devices, this adapter splits power evenly across the devices, which means that all devices will be charged reasonably quickly. It has plugs for the US, UK, Australia, and EU, and a nice locking mechanism to keep the plugs in place.Note, though, that if you're planning to use high-wattage electronics such as hair dryers with this adapter, then it's not for you. This adapter is also not a voltage converter, so be sure to check if your electronics ship with a built-in converter when using the Epicka adapter in other countries. Most phone and laptop chargers are dual voltage, so you probably won't have to worry about it much, but safety first.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

And right now, the usually-pricey Samsung 75-Inch The Frame Pro is on sale for $1,997.99 (originally $2,997.99) this Black Friday, marking its lowest price ever. While the other sizes are also discounted by 33%, this TV offers the biggest savings for the largest size, making it the best overall value.\nWith its generous screen size, this QLED TV delivers a cinematic experience and doubles as a visual conversation piece. Its 4K resolution and NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor ensure bright, sharp images with reliable color accuracy, and it supports gaming speeds of up to 144Hz. Smart features allow you to stream directly and easily connect consoles and other devices. Another perk is its Wireless One Connect box, which contains four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector. It wirelessly streams audio and video to the TV, meaning you only need to hide a single cable rather than a tangle of obvious cords and devices. However, this also could introduce undesirable latency for gamers.The main draw is Art Mode: when you’re not watching TV, it transforms into a framed piece of art with customizable bezels, made even more realistic by a matte, anti-glare finish. You can purchase art through the Samsung Art Store for $4.99 a month or $49.99 a year, or buy high-res art from Etsy vendors and museum or archive sites and load it onto a USB. PCMag notes that while the matte screen, dual functionality, and color performance are all excellent, black levels are less impressive, and contrast is somewhat mediocre.If your priority is a TV that performs well for everyday viewing while doubling as a digital picture frame to elevate your interior design, the Samsung 75-Inch The Frame Pro is a great choice, especially at its current discount. However, it may not be ideal if you’re looking for an ultra-bright picture with deeper contrast or a display optimized for gaming.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

A convenient way for kids aged 6-12 to consume Amazon content safely, it’s 45% off at $104.99 (originally $189.99) in three different colors, marking its lowest price ever.The tablet, which has won awards for its strong parental controls and earned an “Excellent” rating from PCMag, features built-in safeguards that enhance online security. It comes in a durable slim case with a kickstand handle and a 10.1-inch Full HD display (1920×1200) that kids can use for reading, playing games, or streaming their favorite shows. Camera quality is mediocre at 5 MP, but adequate for video calls.\nAn updated processor with two Arm Cortex-A76 cores at 2.05GHz and six Arm Cortex-A55 cores at 2.0GHz makes it significantly faster than its predecessor, according to PCMag. The tablet can stream video for just under 10.5 hours on maximum brightness and takes around four hours to fully charge on a 9W power adaptor (closer to three hours with a 15W charger)It comes with 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage (enough for everyday multitasking), as well as a free year of ad-free, Amazon Kids Plus content (otherwise $5 a month, or $8 for non-Prime members). It comes with a two-year warranty, which, along with the rugged case, can give you peace of mind for kids’ use. If you don’t want a tablet focused on Amazon-only content and services (or want one that they can grow into with more productivity apps and high-performance games), more versatile options like the iPad might be better (though they’ll come with a higher price tag). This tablet also doesn’t come with Wi-Fi 6 or 6E. That said, if your priorities are good hardware, a large, attractive screen, and enough processing power for multitasking, the Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet is a budget-friendly option for monitored screen time or keeping kids entertained during car rides and flights. At around $100 right now, it’s one of the best kids’ tablets on the market.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

I recently used AI to incorporate her art into physical gifts. If you want to achieve the same quality with a meaningful family photo, here's how you can utilize Adobe's new upscaling features to get the best results.\nFor this process, I used Adobe Firefly and Photoshop. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's generative AI application, and the company released a phone app this summer to help you create on the go. If you're a total newbie to Firefly, you can just ask the app for help along the way. Photoshop, which has long been the gold standard for image editing, recently added an AI upscaling feature that can improve scanned photos or images with the click of a button. Here's how I did it.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nHow I used Adobe AI features to make giftsI started by using Adobe Firefly to visualize my mom’s art on various products, including aprons, scarves, and even dresses. Seeing mockup options helped me decide on an apron as the perfect first piece.Next, I brought an image of an original painting into Photoshop and used the AI upscaling feature. Wearables require a much larger print size, and this step ensures every detail stays crisp and vibrant. I then uploaded the file to Printful, a print-on-demand platform. You can also use Printify or a different print-on-demand provider, as the process is nearly identical.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn just a few clicks, the apron was ready to print and ship directly, and it was such a pleasure to see my mom wear her own artwork. With technology and AI, we’ve been able to take her creations beyond the canvas and share them with people everywhere, making every gift feel personal, meaningful, and timeless. If you want to tinker with AI this holiday season, this is one way to get some practice and make a thoughtful gift for a loved one along the way.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

While you can find discounts on everything from fitness trackers to Kindles, subscriptions also have Black Friday sales, too. Case in point: Apple TV—not Apple TV+ anymore, mind you. Apple's own subscription service typically costs a relatively expensive $12.99 per month. But new and returning Apple TV customers can snag a six-month subscription to Apple TV for $5.99 per month. That amounts to more than a 50% discount on each month (53.89%, to be precise). You have some time to claim this price cut. This is a Black Friday deal, after all, so you'll be able to sign up now through Dec. 1 at 8 p.m. PT (Cyber Monday). Once you do, you'll be set for six months, but just make sure to keep an eye on the calendar: Once those six months are up, Apple will go back to charging you the full $12.99. You'll also need to subscribe through a method where Apple bills you directly. You won't be eligible for the discount if you sign up for Apple TV through a third-party provider. Finally, you won't be eligible if your account qualifies for a free trial.If you haven't been tuned in to Apple TV, now's a great time to check it out. The platform has surprisingly great catalogue, including popular shows like Severance, Ted Lasso, and Shrinking. Plus, there are a number of shows airing new episodes right now, like Pluribus, The Morning Show, and The Last Frontier. You can redeem the offer from any device that bills directly to Apple, or from Apple TV's official site.Does Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare its sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online.

While I expected to slot the XP-Pen Magic Note Pad into that category—it's an LED Android tablet with three screen modes that purport to take it from full color to e-ink mode, transforming it from a notebook, to a media player, to an e-reader—it's actually most impressive as a drawing tablet.Unfortunately, I cannot draw, but this thing made me wish I could. It's marked down 35% for Black Friday, from $400 to $260, $25 less than it was during Prime Day and cheaper than I have ever seen it.\nThe Magic Note Pad has three screens in one, sort ofOstensibly, the Magic Note Pad's biggest selling point is its \"X-Paper\" screen (which appears to be a rebranded version of TCL's NXTPAPER display), which has 1920 x 1200 resolution, a 90 Hz refresh rate, and maximum 400 nits of brightness (in comparison, the entry level iPad offers a 60 Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of brightness). It has an etched surface to reduce glare as well as three different color modes, controlled at the operating system level, that are purported to take it from full color LED tablet to a black and white e-reader. There's a dedicated button on the top of the device that allows you to choose between:Nature Color Mode, or the standard you'd expect from any LED screenLight Color Mode, which makes bright whites look creamier and mutes other colors, akin to the effect of reading on newsprint (or a color e-ink reader like the Kindle Colorsoft)Ink Paper Mode, which purports to replicate a grayscale e-ink displayIf you're familiar with the various technologies involved, you'll see that it's quite impossible for a backlit LED screen to transform into an e-ink screen simply by adjusting the color settings. The device is TÜV SÜD Low Blue Light Certified, indicating it reduces blue light by 25%. It also carries a Paper Like Display Certification, which I guess means it is more paper-like than other LED screens, offering a \"more comfortable and natural reading experience.\" The etched screen does reduce glare, and reading in Ink Paper Mode will tax your eyes a bit less if you're reading in a dim room, but take it outside, and it's unquestionably still an LED tablet—you can't magically read in direct sunlight just by switching the display mode.Digital artists love the Magic Note Pad stylusThe Magic Note Pad's real draw (no pun intended) is actually less productivity and more artistic: A ton of digital artists have reviewed it on Reddit and YouTube, and they uniformly praise it for its super-responsive stylus, which offers four times the pressure sensitivity of an Apple Pencil—16,384 pressure levels for the XP-Pen's included stylus, versus a mere 4,096 pressure levels for the Apple Pencil.More pressure levels give you more control over what actually winds up on the screen, so you can sketch and \"paint\" with far more accuracy—giving you all the control you'd have in the real world in a digital environment. It's enough to make me want to sign up for a drawing class.At the current 35% discount, the Magic Note Pad drops from an \"artists only\" $400 to a more affordable $260, which is a decent deal even if all you're looking for is an above-average, stylus-supporting Android tablet to use as a digital notebook or e-reader and to stream media. It has a Mediatek MT8781 Octa-core processor, which appears to be a reliable mid-range chip, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and an 8000mAh battery, which will last a few days between charges based on typical usage. There's also a front-facing camera for video calls. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn short, if you want a tablet for drawing and have been sweating over the combined cost of an iPad and an Apple Pencil, here's a great opportunity to save some money.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and sales run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online.

Other times, I'm overcome with the sudden desire to wallpaper the kitchen. I am constantly in a state of decorating, cleaning, rearranging, and generally improving. Lately, that's involved a lot of tech and appliance upgrades to make my environment better and more serviceable, not just nice to look at. One of the best things I've gotten my hands on is the Shark TurboBlade Cool + Heat, which is both a heater and a fan. I'm picky about both because I always want to be warmer and need a heater, but I also like the noise of a fan at night to fall asleep (while I'm safe from the cool air under my blanket). Having both in one has been awesome and, now that the device is $150 off for Black Friday, you should consider getting one, too. \nFirst of all, I always want to be upfront when I've been given something by a company so I can review it. That's what happened here. I don't write a nice review if something stinks, though, so here I am, saying this thing is extremely useful. Typically, the TurboBlade Cool + Heat is $400. That's a lot, although it makes economic sense if you don't want to spend a bunch of money on a good fan and a good heater separately. It also makes sense for someone like me in a little apartment. It's frustrating to have to store two large devices when I could just have one. Still, the discount, which puts this at $250 for the shopping holiday, is much appreciated. The fanThe TurboBlade Cool + Heat is bladeless and modern-looking, which I like. It's also powerful. You can adjust it up to 10 levels of air-blasting, so you can get just a touch or a whole wind storm. I opt for a level-10 wind storm because I am especially interested in white noise at bedtime, but it comes with a convenient little remote so if it gets too loud or too airy, I don't have to get up to adjust it. The heat option, which is easy to toggle on, has three modes. There's a filter at the bottom that looks easy to clean, but I haven't had to do that yet. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: SharkNinja/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nYou can turn the vents horizontally or vertically, plus it can tilt and oscillate on its own. If you're going to pay a few hundred bucks for something, it should do a few cool tricks, and this does. You can also dim the control panel, which I do because I like to sleep in pitch darkness. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSome tech specs: It has 1,400 watts, its air flow capacity is 1,180 cubic feet per minute, and its top speed is 10 RPM. It has a 120 voltage and weighs a little over 21 pounds. I am a simple person, so I don't pay attention to any of those things except the weight. It doesn't come put-together, so I foolishly assembled it in the middle of my entryway (which was perfectly easy to do and took me maybe five minutes), then had to haul it around, assembled and heavy, to place it where I wanted it. Is 21 pounds a ton of weight? No, but it was tricky for me to push it up the ladder into my lofted bedroom and I do wish I had assembled it in the room where I planned to use it. Just a word of advice. What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot.

You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Some tips for a successful Black Friday with AmazonIf this will be your first Black Friday shopping at Amazon, there are some basic things you need to know about Amazon sales:You can share your Prime membership with family members even if they don't live with you.You can set price alerts for products you want and your Alexa devices can notify you when they go on sale.There are usually some \"Invite-Only\" deals that you can sign up for.There are tools you can use to see if the deal you're looking at is good or not.But if you only take one bit of advice for shopping on Amazon, let it be this one: Don't buy anything you weren't going to buy anyway. A good way to make sure you do this is by making a list of the products you do want, and only having eyes for those.Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

That’s a steep drop from its original price for what is still a current and capable machine. With an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, and Apple’s M2 chip inside, this MacBook handles most day-to-day tasks with ease. Web browsing, photo editing, app switching, and light video work all feel smooth and quick, and the 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display is bright at 500 nits, supports a wide P3 color gamut, and offers sharp resolution at 2880x1864. If you’ve been using a smaller screen or an older laptop, the difference is noticeable.The M2 MacBook Air offers up to 18 hours of battery life for video playback or 15 hours for web use, so it’s built for long stretches without needing a charger, though your mileage may vary depending on use. The port selection includes MagSafe 3 for charging and two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, which cover most use cases but does mean you'll likely need adapters for more complex setups. The six-speaker system is surprisingly full for a laptop this size and supports Spatial Audio, which pairs well with the 1080p FaceTime camera and three-mic array for video calls. Bluetooth 5.3 and wifi 6 round out the connectivity, keeping everything modern. And while the 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD will suit general use, creatives or heavier users might prefer upgrading to the 512GB, 1TB, or even 2TB configurations, which are also discounted on StackSocial at the moment.Since it’s a pre-owned device, this unit comes with a Grade A refurbished rating, which means you’re getting something that may (or may not) have a few tiny scuffs, but nothing that affects performance. It also includes a 30-day parts and labor warranty, just in case. You won’t get macOS preinstalled in every case, but the device can be updated to the latest macOS Tahoe 26. If you want a larger MacBook with modern power but don’t want to spend over $1,000, this is one of the more balanced deals you’ll find, especially considering it’s less than half the price of a new 15-inch MacBook Pro.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online.

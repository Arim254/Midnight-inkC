Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.And then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        The big shopping outlets are gearing up for another Black Friday sale season, and we’ll be on top of all those deals as they become available. Garmin announced several early Black Friday deals that are already live, and Google and Coros have now confirmed discounts on some of their wearables, too. In Google's case, it's a sale on Pixel Watch 4 and Fitbit devices, and Coros has announced a price drop on watches in its popular Pace line. To keep an eye on prices yourself, consider using these deal-tracking tools that can alert you as soon as the price drops, and that can show you the history of price changes when you think you've found a deal. (Our deals writer Daniel Oropeza, who compiled that list, considers CamelCamelCamel one of the best. My personal favorite is Keepa.)As Black Friday approaches, I’ll keep looking out for deals on fitness gear including fitness trackers and smartwatches, so let me give you a preview of what I’m expecting—and hoping—to see, plus the deals that are already live.  \nFitness trackers already on sale for Black FridayBlack Friday is still a couple weeks away, but the following devices are already discounted in early Black Friday deals. Coros Pace 3Coros doesn’t usually participate in big sale events, but the company just launched the Pace 4, which costs $249 and which performed excellently in my review. That means the Pace 3 gets a price drop—as of November 14, the Pace 3 is $199 instead of $229. I like the Pace 3 a lot as a simple but powerful running watch. Another watch to pay attention to is the Pace Pro, a big sister to the 3 and 4 with a larger screen and built-in maps. No other big-name watch gives you maps on a watch at this price point, and the Pace Pro is also dropping in price, to $299, instead of the previous price of $349. Note that Coros seems to be dropping these prices permanently, so this isn't just a Black Friday deal.Garmin Forerunner 165The 165 is Garmin’s modern entry-level watch. No offense to the 55, but it feels like a holdover from the past, as evidenced by the fact it’s four years old and has had to sit out two generations of newer models from the company. The 165 doesn’t feel outdated yet, though, and our resident marathoner Meredith Dietz loved the 165 Music. Its sibling, the 165 (same thing, just no offline music storage), made my list of the best affordable running watches.Because it comes in those two versions, you’ll want to pay attention to the differences. The music edition typically costs $50 more. Normally the version without music storage is $249, and the version with is $299. Earlier, I wrote that I'd keep an eye out for another drop to $199.99 like last year's Black Friday sale. Well, it's here! The Forerunner 165 is $199, and the Forerunner 165 Music is $249.99. Garmin Forerunner 265 (a surprise!)If I’m confusing you with all these model numbers, I have an explainer here that will help you follow along. In any case, the 265 and 965 are still good watches, and I wrote earlier that this year we might be able to expect more than $100 off for those two. It looks like my wish has come true—the 265 is now going for $299.99 ($150 off) and the 965 is $449.99 (also $150 off).The Black Friday deals I'm still hoping to seeMost of my predictions here are based on the sales I’ve seen from these models in the past. For devices that are new this year, I'm looking at last year's prices on the models that were new at the time. Most of the companies on my list have both newer and older models available. Here are the prices I’ll be looking for to know when I’ve found a great deal.Apple Watch Series 11: $329 or lowerLast year’s Series 10 watch dropped as low as $329 for Black Friday. This year, the Series 11 is the newest model (see our associate tech editor Michelle Ehrhardt’s take on it here). The base model has the same regular retail price of $399 as the Series 10 did last year, so a repeat of that discount seems likely. Apple’s “series” watches come in two sizes and two connectivity options, so I’m focusing on the smaller model without cellular. Expect larger sizes to cost $20 more and cellular to cost $100 more.So if all is equal, this year’s Black Friday should bring Series 11 deals of $329 or so. Lower would be great! It’s harder to know what to expect from the Series 10, since it’s older. But last year the older model (the Series 9) was available for $219 as a Black Friday deal, so I’d keep an eye out for similarly steep discounts on the 10 this year. Pixel Watch 4: $279 or lowerThe newest version of Google’s Pixel Watch is the 4, which I reviewed here. Google has confirmed that a sale will begin Nov. 20 that will let buyers \"save up to $100 on Pixel Watch 4.\" This watch sells for prices from $349.99 to $499.99 so that suggests sale prices of $249.99 to $399.99 depending on whether you opt for the larger or smaller size, with cellular connectivity or without.While we wait for the exact prices, I'll tell you what I expect based on past sales. In 2024, the Pixel Watch 3 dipped down to $279 for Black Friday, from a regular price of $349, so I would expect something similar for the 4 this year. The Pixel Watch 4 is currently at the same starting point of $349 and up. As with the Apple Watch, I’m quoting numbers for the smaller, non-cellular model. The larger size costs $50 more and cellular capabilities cost $100 more.If you’re interested in buying the older model, you’re already in luck. As I write this, the some colors of the Pixel Watch 3 are on sale for $199.99, $100 off the usual price. If last year’s sales on the Pixel Watch 2 are any indication, the 3 might drop as low as $145.Garmin Forerunner 970: $699 or lowerGarmin’s 970 and 570 have never been on a real sale yet; both were launched earlier this year. The 970, with maps and an LED flashlight, has a retail price of $749. The 570, which is missing those two features but is still an excellent higher-end running watch, sits at $549. Will Black Friday bring the first sales for these watches? I think there’s a good chance of it, but I’m not expecting a huge discount. Last year, the previous models—the 265 and 965—were both $100 off, but they were a year and a half old at that point. Go back two years, to when they were newer, and the discount was more like $50. Garmin Forerunner 55: $149 or lowerGarmin’s Forerunner 55 is its most basic running watch, which I have mixed feelings about. It’s missing a lot of features that other entry-level Garmin Forerunners, like the 165, have as a matter of course. But it does great at the basic job of tracking your runs, and I’ve always felt that if Garmin could get it closer to $99, I’d sing its praises from the rooftops. It’s never dropped quite that low, though. The original sticker price was $199.99, and it’s often sitting somewhere around $169.99. As of today, it's equaling the lowest price I've seen in the past, $149.99. This watch isn’t getting any younger, and I think if Garmin’s smart, it'll consider a steeper price drop this Black Friday. Fitbit Charge 6: $99 or lower Google has confirmed that the Fitbit Charge 6 will be available for $99.95 starting Nov. 20. This device has a sticker price of $159.95, but often sells for a good bit less, and occasionally drops down near $100. When I first wrote up my predictions earlier this month, the Charge 6 was already down to $99.95—but that seems to have been a temporary drop, since it's back up to $128.95 as I write this.With this low price coming so early in November, I wondered whether a Black Friday deal might drop it even further—but it seems Google is hinting that $99.95 is as low as it's going to get. The Charge 6 isn’t the best one out there, but it fits the bill of an “I don’t want to think about it” basic tracker. If you just want to track your steps without overthinking which model to get, this is a fine pick. \n            ",

Naturally, scammers are using this model to collect your personal data and promising huge rewards that never materialize. According to a report from Malwarebytes Labs, bad actors are luring users into taking surveys through malvertising ads claiming you've won a Walmart voucher for hundreds of dollars. All you have to do is answer a few questions—easy enough—but you're actually handing over information that can be used to target you even further. Surveys promising big rewards are a scamThese scams start with malvertising (malicious advertising) like website pop-ups and banners, spam emails, and social media ads stating that you've been selected to receive a \"free\" gift card worth hundreds of dollars. The fake ads use official logos from recognizable brands, which build trust, along with countdown timers, which promote urgency. You may think you've gotten lucky, and all you have to do is take a short survey to earn a big payout. When you click through, though, you're redirected to a fake rewards page, which may also look credible thanks to stolen branding. You'll be prompted to provide personal information, such as your name, phone number, email, and address, as well as indicate interest in topics like home repair and insurance. You may be redirected again based on your answers—to a spoofed home improvement site for FindMyWindowPro or Renewal By Anderson, for example—where you're prompted to provide even more data. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis endless loop of surveys doesn't end with a gift card payout, and along the way, you've handed scammers a lot of information that can be sold and used to target you with much more personalized scams in the future based on interests you've handed them. Survey scams may seem like simply a waste of time rather than a real threat, since you don't lose any money right away. But you may see more spam calls and believable phishing emails as a result. Avoid fake survey scamsLike all scams, this one plays on emotion: notably, the excitement of getting lucky and winning big. You're lured in with a sense of urgency and the illusion of low effort. Scammers also use real branding to make the scheme seem more credible. As always, these elements should raise suspicion. Retailers are almost never offering promotions that are too good to be true, and you should never provide personal information in exchange for a \"free\" prize. If you do click through one of these ads, look carefully at the URL, which is almost certainly not the retailer's official domain. How to actually get paid for taking surveysYou can get paid to take surveys or test apps and games, though you certainly won't earn the hundreds of dollars promised in survey scams. The pay is low for the time invested (in most cases, a few dollars per hour) and some survey platforms require you to hit a minimum amount earned to request a payout. You typically have to engage consistently and across multiple platforms to make it worthwhile. NerdWallet compiled a list of popular survey-for-money apps, including Make Money, Eureka, InboxDollars Surveys, Google Opinion Rewards, and Swagbucks. Reddit users also suggest Survey Junkie and Branded Surveys. Prolific is a relatively high-paying platform, though you have to join a waitlist to gain access. Of course, you should know that even legitimate survey sites collect a lot of personal information, such as your birth date, zip code, phone number, and health history. All of this may be sold to data brokers, and there's always a risk of a data breach that could lead to identity theft. Be sure to weigh the risks and rewards of signing up for these platforms. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple brought RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging to the iPhone with iOS 18 last year, giving green-bubble users access to more features and functions. But what exactly is possible with RCS on the iPhone, and what is still exclusive to iMessage users? Are Android RCS users now fully integrated into chats in the iOS Messages app or not?I'll lay out exactly what you can do in RCS chats between iPhones and Android phones, and explain which features are still missing—and when you might be able to get them.  If you've got contacts on other mobile platforms, this should help you understand more about what the experience is like from their end.To use RCS, you must have a carrier that supports it (most now do). On an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging to enable it. In Google Messages on Android, tap your profile picture (top right), then choose Messages settings and RCS chats to turn on the feature.\nRCS on iOS and Android: what you can do Ever since iOS 18, RCS messaging has officially been supported in the iOS Messages app—specifically, via the RCS Universal Profile 2.4. This brings green bubble Android users closer to parity with iMessage users, though some features only work in one direction, and some features only work in one-to-one conversations and not group chats.One notable upgrade is support for high-resolution photos and videos, which should work seamlessly across all your RCS-enabled conversations, with no more issues around compression or transfer. Web links look better as well, because you'll get a proper preview shown on both Android and iOS, and you can share current locations too (though only as a static pin, not a live and updating one).\n    \n            \n            Web links now look much better between iOS and Android.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTyping indicators and read receipts are supported in both directions, assuming you've got them enabled on your devices. However, they don't work in group chats—RCS users on Android can now join group chats, but the experience can be buggy based on reports, and you lose the typing indicators and the read receipts.Emoji reactions are now supported, up to a point—but based on my testing, these only work from iPhone to Android. If you try and send an emoji reaction in the other direction, iPhone users will just get a separate text showing the emoji (it won't appear as a bubble on top of the original message).RCS on iOS and Android: what you can't do (yet)If you look at everything you can do in iMessage (with other iMessage users) and Google Messages (with other Android RCS users), you'll realize there's a long way to go when it comes to cross-platform support. For example, at the moment you can't unsend messages, or reply inline in a thread, either from Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android.You can edit messages, but only if you're an Android user messaging an iPhone user—and with the caveat that the iPhone user gets two texts (the original message and the edited message, which rather defeats the point). The ability to edit messages on an iPhone simply doesn't appear in an RCS conversation.\n    \n            \n            Message editing is something that doesn't quite work yet.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAnother missing feature is end-to-end encryption for your chats and files shared in them. Apple has promised that support for this in RCS conversations is on the way, though it hasn't shown up yet—not even in iOS 26. This should give you pause when it comes to sharing sensitive information in these chats.Full end-to-end encryption is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which Google is testing in beta and which Apple has yet to adopt. Once this next update finally makes its way to iPhones and Android devices, interoperability will be leveled up again—it should, in theory, bring with it full support for message editing, emoji reactions, and inline replies. Until then, it's something of a half-baked implementation, especially for group chats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Having previously been tested as an experimental flag, Google Chrome's Split View feature is now rolling out in the stable version of the browser (version 142). It doesn't seem to be live for everyone at the same time, but some people are seeing it. (I've got it in Chrome on my Mac, but not yet on Windows.) To check you're on the latest version of Chrome, click the three dots (top right) in a browser tab, then choose Settings and About Chrome. If an update is available, it'll be downloaded, and you can restart your browser to apply it.If you're running the latest version of Chrome and still don't see Split View, you can either wait for the feature to reach you or switch the flag on. Type \"chrome://flags/#side-by-side\" into your browser address bar and hit Enter, then enable the feature and restart your browser. You should then have Split View.\nIt works exactly as you might guess from the name: Split View enables you to have two sites or apps open in the same tab, so you can, for example, dive deep into a Lifehacker article while also keeping an eye on social media. It works much better than just having two Chrome windows up side-by-side in Windows or macOS.How to create a Split ViewThere are a couple of ways to create a Split View. One is to right-click on a tab header and then choose Add tab to new split view from the menu that pops up: The selected tab takes up one half of the Chrome window, and in the other half you can choose another open tab (if there aren't any other open tabs, you'll see the New Tab page).The other method is to click and drag an open tab (using its header), or a web link, to the far left or far right of another tab—you should then see a small space open, with a Create split view label. Getting the dragging and positioning right can take a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty straightforward.\n    \n            \n            Look for a new Split View feature in Chrome.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAfter that, the split tab works more or less like any other normal tab. You can drag it into a different position or into a different window, and you can right-click on it to access the tab options (for muting or pinning, for example). The split view tab will have two small \"x\" icons on it, for closing either half of the tab separately—to close them both, right-click on the tab and choose Close.Whenever you're in a split tab, you'll see a new icon on the Chrome toolbar, which you can click to access related features: You can separate the two views, close the left or the right view, or swap the views over from this toolbar button. The same options are available if you right-click on the Split View tab header.How you can use Split ViewSplit view can help any time you need two webpages or web apps on screen at once. One of Google's own suggestions is keeping a document open while you're on a video call, so you can make notes more easily.It's going to work well for any kind of research or note-taking where you're looking something up and then having to write about it. It may also be less than ideal for our attention spans, because you can load up a video on one half of your Split View, and then scroll through social media on the other half.\n    \n            \n            Two sites open in Split View.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can adjust the sizes of each pane by dragging the divider in the middle, though you are limited overall by the size of the Chrome window. You're also able to switch to different websites within a Split View by typing into the address bar as normal—just make sure you've selected the right half of the pane first.The same sort of effect has long been possible in Windows and macOS by snapping two Chrome windows to each side of the screen, but there's something more convenient and straightforward about having two pages up in the same tab. I can see this being something I make use of a lot, especially on an ultrawide monitor.\n            ",

Yes, as part of the November 2025 Pixel feature drop, Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones (excluding the Pixel 9a) are getting AI notification summaries.The problem with AI notification summariesIf you're reeling back after reading that, I don't blame you. This is one of the few AI features Apple beat Google to the punch on, and when they came out during the iOS 18.3 beta, the summaries were quickly criticized for handling hard topics like breakups with a cold tone, as well as for misreporting the news.Apple quickly pulled news summaries (although they've since come back) and made it clearer when an AI was writing a notification, but it seems Google's still being a bit more cautious with its launch.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow AI Notification Summaries on Pixel work\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nRather than trying to organize every notification you might get, Google's AI Summaries are just starting off with popular chat apps for now, including its own Messages app and alternatives like WhatsApp. Additionally, they'll only kick in on \"longer chats,\" with the idea being to give you, \"digestible conversation recaps.\" That means you're going to see far fewer AI notifications than on the iPhone, which currently uses them for news, entertainment, chats, email, and more. That's probably a safer approach for Google, but it does mean the AI summaries are meant to be used more to get you quickly back up to speed, rather than for organization (although that will change in the future).As on the iPhone, AI notification summaries on the Pixel will be indicated by a small icon with a sparkle and a few lines below it, with the summary following. They'll also be italicized for additional visual distinction.How to turn on AI Notification Summaries on PixelGoogle is also exercising caution by making its AI notification summaries entirely opt-in. That means you'll need to manually turn them on before you start seeing them, which you can do under Settings > Notifications > Notification Summaries. While on this page, you'll also be able to exclude certain apps from sending AI notification summaries, by adding them to the \"Don't include these apps\" list.If you're still not seeing the summaries after enabling them, ensure your Android System Intelligence is enabled under Settings > Notifications > Privacy > Notification read, reply & control. Additionally, summaries will not be generated while your phone is in battery saver mode, or while you're actively using it (per Google, for them to kick in, \"the screen must be off for a moment\").When will my Pixel get AI Notification Summaries?AI Notification summaries start rolling out today, alongside the November system patch. However, they're not automatically included in the downloadable patch, so it might be a while before you see them (I don't have them yet).It's still not a bad idea to get your phone fully up-to-date in the meantime. To download the November 2025 Pixel update, either wait for a notification from Google, or head to Settings > System > Software updates to manually check if it's been rolled out to you yet.What's next for Pixel's AI Notification Summaries?While today's update is clearly just Google dipping its toes in the water, the company does have bigger plans for December, where some Pixels will also start automatically silencing \"lower-priority notifications\" and will start automatically sorting them into categories like \"News\" and \"Promotions.\" Hopefully, Google will have learned some lessons from Apple by the time those features go live.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

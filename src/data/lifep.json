The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

You can now pick this versatile, reliable streaming box for $74.99 on Amazon, down from its original price of $99.99.\nLifehacker's review of the device highlights the smoothness of the user interface, the wealth of onboard storage, the bonus of having an Ethernet port (for steady internet access), and the benefits of the improved remote control—which you can actually make sound an alarm if you lose it. (Invaluable!)I've been using and loving Google TV for years, and the Google Streamer is a great way to access it. I like its broad support for multiple streaming apps, and the way it combines all those apps together—making it easy to see what you're currently watching. You can add to your watchlist from all across Google apps and services too, including Google Search.The streaming box and its associated remote are available in either Porcelain or Haze, so you can pick whichever matches your personal taste and internal decor. This 25% Black Friday discount may not last, so if you're interested, I'd recommend getting this bought as soon as possible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

After graduating from college in 2019, I had an amazing job offer fall through because of the lockdown. I felt completely rudderless at a time when I thought I had it all figured out. Since we were all stuck inside together for months, there was no hiding my internal distress from my family.\nFortunately, my parents recognized this even more than I did. That year, they gave me a gift that pulled me out of that pit, reignited my passion for creating, and set the journey in motion that led me to my career today as a professional creator and video producer. That gift was the Cricut Explore, and this device literally changed my life.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nWhat is the Cricut Explore?For those of you who don’t know, Cricut Explore machines let you design and cut tons of materials like vinyl, cardstock, iron-on, and even leather into custom patterns that you can use for shirts, hats, or any other DIY projects that you might have in mind. Able to work with over 100 materials, the Cricut Explore line allows you to create almost anything you want on demand in a user-friendly, inexpensive way. The cost-effective aspect was huge for me, as I had almost zero money to my name and all the time in the world to learn. Since the Cricut Explore works via Bluetooth or USB, I was able to create custom items on request for people, featuring specialized materials and designs that would normally take weeks or months to complete. The Cricut took on a pivotal role in my creative process. It led to the creation of XtarBoy Apparel, my custom apparel company, which would eventually support me throughout the entire pandemic. I made custom shirts for yoga studios, limited-run apparel and merch for micro-influencers, and even inked my first sponsorship deal for a motorsport racing team in San Diego.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Cricut also introduced me to an important business mentor in my life. As I was trying to get XtarBoy off the ground, I had quietly taken on a job at a local auto-tinting place in San Diego, and the owner took a liking to what I was working on. He would request custom shop merch and team gear, and was one of the biggest supporters of my side project when I had almost zero faith in myself. He even set aside a corner of the shop for the Cricut, so I could print things for customers whenever I had one, and let me use the shop as a storefront for all my designs. Later, the gifting came full circle when my mom released her first book series, as I was able to help her with promotion and marketing by making custom merch to pair with the book.Gifts can have lasting valueSometimes we take the gifts we receive for granted. There can be an expectation that they should be the newest device, the latest collab, or the most expensive item in order to be considered a “good gift.” But for me, the greatest gift I got wasn’t just the Cricut itself, but the opportunities and experiences it opened up for me to create, take risks, and challenge myself in a new and exciting way. And at the core, that’s what a holiday with heart truly represents.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But sometimes a company saves a few special things for later, and that turned out to be the case here: These two brand-new watches, released earlier this year, are now both $100 off. I've used and reviewed the Forerunner 570, and found it a step up from the earlier Forerunner 265 (which I also loved). The 570 adds a microphone and two different types of voice assistants, plus some new software features like heat acclimation and the ability to trim your activity if you didn't press \"stop\" when you crossed the race finish line. My only complaint is (or was) that the price seemed a bit steep in comparison to the previous model. But with the current deal, it's a lot closer to the original price of the 265: The 570 is now going for $449.99.\nThe Forerunner 970 is also $100 off, which brings its current price to $649.99. The biggest thing the 970 has going for it over the 570 is that it can show you maps while you run. Both watches can do breadcrumb tracking (drawing a line showing where you've been), but with a fully map-enabled watch, you can see important details like where your hiking route crosses roads or turns along them. The 970 also has an LED flashlight, which is incredibly handy for getting around in the dark—whether that means snuggling into your sleeping bag at a campsite or just sneaking out of your kid's room at bedtime.\nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday When you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ Black Friday tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it is the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily bad, impulse buyers may not realize what they're purchasing.How to tell if a Black Friday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.In order to avoid a low-key scam, you should do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). The bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

It's the best non-Ultra smartwatch for your iPhone and, in my experience, its fitness-related features are excellent. This Black Friday deal brings the Series 11 down to $339 (15% off), which is an excellent price for a brand new Apple Watch.\nThe Series 11 is available in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm; and two variants: GPS, and GPS+Cellular. At time of writing, the best deal is on the 42mm GPS variant. All other variants are more lightly discounted, but be aware that your favorite color may not be discounted during this Black Friday 2025 sale.The key to finding great Apple deals is to buy from third-party retailers, and that's true for this Apple Watch Series 11 deal as well. Amazon's Black Friday 2025 sales have it cheapest right now.Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt said she loves the Apple Watch Series 11, but admittedly, she doesn't recommend it to those who already have a Series 10. If you have an Apple Watch that's a few years old, the Series 11 is worth buying, but it's hasn't taken a big enough leap ahead to justify annual upgrades.The Series 11 is thin, light, and plenty comfortable to wear all day. It has support for hypertension notifications, ECG recording, built-in GPS for tracking outdoor workouts, and an Ion-X display that's more scratch resistant than that of older Apple Watch models. It also has improved battery life compared to the Series 10.While it's common knowledge at this point, I still think it's worth mentioning that the Apple Watch only works with iPhones. You can't even pair it with an iPad or a Mac, so this device is only for iPhone users. If that sounds like you, this is a great opportunity for an upgrade.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

In the 10 years I've owned my current car, I've never used the cigarette lighter port. The car came with a single USB-A port, so I've happily just used that to charge my phone instead. About a year ago, though, I got rid of all my USB-A cables, so now I don't have a way to charge my phone when I'm in my car. That's why I've been looking at finally putting that cigarette lighter port to good use, which is when I came across this excellent Black Friday deal on a Ugreen 130W car charger, which is currently going at 44% off.\nI've owned and used a multi-port wall adapter by Ugreen for a couple of years, and it's been working great in my house. The brand has earned my trust, and the car charger listed here also has great reviews on Amazon. It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A, and it supports up to 100W of output on one of those USB-C ports. That's good enough to charge laptops, iPads, and of course, your phones. In case you're wondering about the charger's other two ports, the USB-A port supports 22.5W output and the second USB-C port supports up to 30W.This charger also gives you the option to let multiple people charge their devices quickly when needed. Ugreen has bundled a 3.3-ft USB-C charging cable in the box, which makes it easy for rear seat passengers to charge their devices, too. When you plug it in, the charger's blue LED ring lights up, which also makes it easy to locate the ports at night. The charger has cooling vents on the back to help improve heat dissipation, too. It's a good product at a great price, which is why I'm about to click that buy button.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

I recently used AI to incorporate her art into physical gifts. If you want to achieve the same quality with a meaningful family photo, here's how you can utilize Adobe's new upscaling features to get the best results.\nFor this process, I used Adobe Firefly and Photoshop. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's generative AI application, and the company released a phone app this summer to help you create on the go. If you're a total newbie to Firefly, you can just ask the app for help along the way. Photoshop, which has long been the gold standard for image editing, recently added an AI upscaling feature that can improve scanned photos or images with the click of a button. Here's how I did it.\n\n    \n        Meet industry creators, contributors, and thought leaders who have paired with Lifehacker's award-winning staff to publish first-person commentary from lived experience.\n    \n    \n        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                        \n        \n            Meet our contributors\n            \n        \n    \n\nHow I used Adobe AI features to make giftsI started by using Adobe Firefly to visualize my mom’s art on various products, including aprons, scarves, and even dresses. Seeing mockup options helped me decide on an apron as the perfect first piece.Next, I brought an image of an original painting into Photoshop and used the AI upscaling feature. Wearables require a much larger print size, and this step ensures every detail stays crisp and vibrant. I then uploaded the file to Printful, a print-on-demand platform. You can also use Printify or a different print-on-demand provider, as the process is nearly identical.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn just a few clicks, the apron was ready to print and ship directly, and it was such a pleasure to see my mom wear her own artwork. With technology and AI, we’ve been able to take her creations beyond the canvas and share them with people everywhere, making every gift feel personal, meaningful, and timeless. If you want to tinker with AI this holiday season, this is one way to get some practice and make a thoughtful gift for a loved one along the way.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The sale runs though Cyber Monday, and it's a one-time payment for lifetime access. Once you buy, the redemption code gets emailed to you instantly, and you have 30 days to activate it. There are no recurring fees, just a fully loaded development environment with features that make coding faster, cleaner, and less of a headache.This version of Visual Studio marks a shift—it’s their first 64-bit IDE that handles larger projects without choking. If you’ve ever waited for your code editor to stop freezing while dealing with massive workloads, that’s less of a concern here. It supports cross-platform app development through .NET MAUI, so you're covered whether you’re building for Android, iOS, or desktop. Plus, features like Live Share make collaboration more streamlined. You can co-code in real time, control what collaborators see, and even carry over your custom settings. There’s also IntelliCode, which is basically AI that learns your coding habits and fills in the blanks intelligently. It can finish lines of code or suggest the next logical move based on your style and context. It’s a little eerie, but it works. You can also build, test, and deploy to Azure right from the IDE, which is great if you’re cloud-focused.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are some things to keep in mind. This is for Windows users only. If you’re working on a Chromebook, iPad, or even a 32-bit system—this won’t work. It’s compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and you’ll need at least 4GB of RAM (though more is better). Depending on the number of features you install, it also requires storage space ranging from 850MB to 210 GB. For just $10 for Microsoft Visual Studio, this is a great steal and worth trying out. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Right now, Microsoft Visio 2021 Professional is on sale for just $10 for a lifetime license on StackSocial for new users. The deal runs through Cyber Monday. It’s priced low enough to justify adding to your digital toolbox, whether you use it often or just occasionally. It’s the same full version of Visio Pro, licensed for one Windows PC, no subscription required.Visio turns overwhelming data into clean visuals. Visio keeps things intuitive, whether mapping a new office layout, building org charts from Excel data, or sketching a workflow diagram with a stylus on your touch device. The interface is packed with over 250,000 shapes and templates (that aren't included in the web version), including standards-compliant options like UML 2.5 and BPMN 2.0. It’s more than just drawing boxes and arrows—it lets you link diagrams to live data and keep everything dynamic. It’s ideal for IT, architecture, business analysis, and other professionals who don’t want to start from scratch whenever they plan something out.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, it’s not the most plug-and-play experience for everyone. While the standalone license is solid, unlocking features like cloud collaboration, editing Power BI dashboards, or syncing with OneDrive requires additional Microsoft 365 subscriptions. If you're already in Microsoft’s ecosystem, this will slide right into place. If not, it could feel limited depending on how much integration you need. But this lifetime license offers an extremely cheap entry point into serious visual planning for single-PC users looking to diagram efficiently with powerful, pro-grade tools. Just be sure to redeem the code within 30 days, and make sure your system meets the basic Windows 10/11 or Server 2019 requirements.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It’s quietly undercutting them. At $699 for the unlocked 512GB Arctic Dawn model, down from $849, it’s currently at its lowest price according to price trackers, making a strong case for itself if you’ve been eyeing an Android phone with top-tier specs without crossing the $1,000 threshold. \nIt runs on the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with 16GB RAM, includes a massive 6.82-inch ProXDR OLED display that stays readable even in direct sunlight, and delivers all-day battery life. Add in 80W wired charging (with the charger actually in the box) and a surprisingly premium build with IP68/IP69 protection, and you start to wonder why this phone isn’t getting more buzz. It also supports wireless charging, but you’ll need to buy OnePlus’ AirVOOC charger separately, notes this PCMag review.Performance-wise, it holds its own. Whether you’re juggling dozens of apps or pushing it with demanding games, the OnePlus 13 barely breaks a sweat. Plus, its 120Hz refresh rate makes everyday scrolling feel extra smooth. On the connectivity side, you get wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, and support for advanced audio codecs like LDAC and LHDC 5.0, which is great news for wireless headphone users. OnePlus’ ongoing collaboration with Hasselblad anchors the camera setup of the OnePlus 13, and this year, all three rear lenses are 50MP—main, telephoto, and ultra-wide. Color reproduction leans natural, not oversaturated, which is great if you prefer photos that don’t need major editing. Software updates won’t go as long as Pixel or Galaxy phones, which might be a dealbreaker if you plan to keep your phone for years. And it doesn’t have a microSD card slot, so the 512GB you get is all you’ll have. But if you want top-tier performance, clean design, and unbeatable battery life for the price, the OnePlus 13 is one of the best values out there right now.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

If you're looking for your first pack of smart lights, my Black Friday recommendation would be the three-pack Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Light Bulbs, yours for $69.99 for Black Friday – the lowest the pack has ever been on Amazon.\nI've been using Philips Hue lights in my home for years, and can thoroughly recommend them. They're versatile and reliable, they come in all shapes and sizes, they integrate with a whole host of third-party apps and services, and they offer a bunch of features for you to play around with.The app is really well designed and makes it easy to do simple tasks (like just turn your lights on and off and adjust their color) and more complex ones (like setting up different lighting scenes for different times of the day) alike. These Philips Hue A19 Smart Bulbs can work on their own, but to access the full set of features, it's worth investing in a Philips Hue Bridge as well, which will make adding more lights really easy too.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

This $100 discount makes Sony’s next-gen VR headset feel a lot more accessible, especially for PS5 owners who’ve been on the fence. \nThe bundle includes the full VR2 setup and a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain, a title built specifically to show off what the hardware can do. PCMag gave the PS VR2 an \"outstanding\" rating for good reason—this is a big leap from Sony’s first attempt at VR, with sharper visuals, better motion tracking, and more immersive gameplay.The PS VR2 runs at a resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 per eye, with a 120Hz refresh rate and full 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) tracking. Translation: It feels smooth and looks sharp, even during fast-paced movement. The eye-tracking tech is surprisingly useful, helping menus feel more intuitive and making foveated rendering possible (basically, games focus the highest resolution where you're actually looking). Setup is easy, and the build is lightweight, so it doesn’t take long to get going, and it doesn’t weigh your head down during longer sessions. The included Sense controllers are responsive and add physical feedback that makes everything from climbing to archery in Horizon feel a bit more tactile.That said, there are a few caveats. The PS VR2 only works with a PlayStation 5, and it isn’t backward-compatible with original PS VR games. So, if you already have a VR library from the first generation, you won’t be able to carry it over. The game library is growing, but it's still catching up to PC-based systems. Even so, for anyone new to VR or upgrading from older hardware, this bundle is one of the best values we’ve seen. At $299, you're getting one of the most polished VR experiences available right now, without diving into PC setups or spending double the price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Does Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

(The accompanying app is straightforward and intuitive, too.)Going for a battery-powered option means you won't have to mess around with wires or drilling, though you will have to recharge it every few months or so. You get head-to-toe coverage of people arriving at your door, and a high definition 1440 x 1440 pixel video feed you can tap into from your phone whenever you like.With support for two-way audio you can even chat to people at the door (whether you're at home or not) and there's color night vision here as well, so you can still see what's happening outside during the hours of darkness. Certain extra features, including video archives and person and package detection, require a Ring subscription.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

The Bose SoundLink Revolve+ (Series II) is available at 40% off during Amazon's Black Friday 2025 sale, and it's a really good product at that price. I have the original SoundLink Revolve speaker, and I love its minimalist looks, how small it is, and how easily it slots into any corner of my room. I don't always like speakers that have a flashy design, so this Bose product is great for me. \nWith the Revolve+, Bose has kept the same design language as the original, but now there's a convenient strap for you to pick it up and carry it around, making it even more portable. The sound quality is pretty good for the price, too, and you can actually link two of these speakers together to create an easy stereo setup. If you're looking for a fuss-free Bluetooth speaker with good sound quality, the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is a great choice. My only major complaint is that it still uses an ancient micro-USB port for charging, which is a big oversight from Bose. Fortunately, you can rectify that annoyance by buying the Bose SoundLink Revolve charging cradle ($30). With that, you can drop the speaker on the cradle to charge it, which is a lot easier than fiddling with a micro-USB cable.I'll also say that, being smaller, this isn't the best product if you want the loudest speaker on the market. You'd probably want to go towards Bose's SoundLink Max for that (but good news: it's also on sale). Instead, this is a great speaker for those who live in compact spaces and want something that can play relaxing, bass-y music just loud enough to fill the room they're in. Or, if you have two of them, they also work well for movies. Note that the Revolve+ also has an aux port, which means that you can use it as a wired speaker with your laptop or PC.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

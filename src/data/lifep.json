    "body": "\n        \n        Scammers never miss an opportunity to prey on people's fear and confusion—and now they're capitalizing on the ongoing federal government shutdown to steal money and information from vulnerable targets. As Axios notes, reports of imposter scams—in which fraudsters impersonate government officials or agency representatives—rose in October as Americans experienced the loss of federal services and benefits. The Better Business Bureau's (BBB) Scam Tracker received 211 such complaints last month. Scammers are also taking advantage of shutdown stress to pull people into investment schemes and other malicious (and AI-driven) activity. Common government shutdown scams One common variety of shutdown scam is government impersonation. Bad actors may call, text, or email you pretending to represent a federal agency—like the IRS or Social Security Administration—that has programs or benefits you use. They'll ask you to verify personal information or pay a fee to avoid losing your benefits or interrupting your service. In some cases, they may even threaten you with fines or legal action if you don't comply. This is a common scam tactic that relies on people acting quickly out of fear. \nOther scammers may pose as service providers trying to help you access certain government programs (like passport renewal) or offering grants or financial assistance. Axios highlights one such instance in which the individual received a call about a $5,000 \"relief check.\" There are multiple reports of scammers targeting SNAP recipients with offers of emergency food or grocery relief. People in areas with federal offices or military bases may be targeted specifically.In these cases, bad actors may try to collect sensitive information, which they can use to steal your identity. Scam emails and texts to \"redeem\" or \"claim\" offers are also vectors for phishing links, which may lead to spoofed government websites designed to harvest your login credentials or other data. AI is facilitating many of these schemes: Nevada's deputy secretary of state for securities issued a warning this week about scammers using AI to impersonate government officials, law enforcement, and financial professionals as well as to create deepfakes of trusted individuals known to potential victims—making it more likely that targets will send money or provide access to their information.  Protect yourself from shutdown scamsYou should always be on guard against common scam tactics, such as any unsolicited communication that either sounds too good to be true or sparks a strong emotion (like fear). Know that scammers will often ramp up activity when people are vulnerable in hopes that you will act before thinking. If you get a call, text, or email from someone who pressures you, it's probably a scam. Never click on links in from unverified sources, and always confirm that the person on the other end is who they claim to be by contacting the organization through their official website or social media channels. You should also verify urgent communication from family or friends—no matter how personal it sounds—especially if you're being asked to send money. Government employees will not call and demand that you hand over money or personal information—and right now, many are furloughed as most federal agencies are closed. (Unfortunately, that includes the Federal Trade Commission, so consumers currently cannot log fraud reports or opt into the Do Not Call registry.) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        The security of a popular wifi router brand is under scrutiny from multiple federal agencies, and devices could be pulled from shelves in the United States in the future. According to reporting from the Washington Post, the US Department of Commerce has proposed a ban on routers from TP-Link Systems, a move that has now received support from Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Defense. What is the issue with TP-Link?The proposal reportedly stems from security concerns with routers sold by TP-Link Systems, which is in California but was spun off from the Chinese-based TP-Link Technologies. Commerce officials have warned that the devices handle sensitive data and may be subject to influence by the Chinese government. For example, there is concern that TP-Link is required to provide information to Chinese intelligence agencies and central government, which could in turn force software updates that compromise user data. (It is important to note that U.S.-based TP-Link Systems disputes this and says that only U.S. engineers can push patches to devices owned by U.S. customers.)\nThe interagency review of TP-Link actually began during the Biden administration—and this isn't the first action the federal government has taken against tech companies that have foreign ties. In June 2024, the Commerce Department banned sales of antivirus software from Russia's Kaspersky Lab to U.S. consumers.  Is my TP-Link router affected?Again, the proposal under consideration could ban future sales of TP-Link Systems routers to U.S. users. Existing devices from TP-Link have been targeted by threat actors and been subject to zero-day vulnerabilities, including a flaw that allowed full takeover. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, most internet-connected devices are vulnerable to hackers, and while some security experts express caution when it comes to TP-Link, there isn't unilateral support for tossing your router ASAP. Instead, you should continue to follow security best practices to protect your home network, such as changing default login credentials, enabling protective features like a firewall and encryption, and keeping your device's firmware up to date. If you do need to purchase a new router—if you stop renting from your internet service provider, for example—you might consider a different brand. Some estimates suggest that TP-Link's home routers make up as much as half of the market in the U.S. (though others put the numbers much lower). Many of those devices are sold or leased through ISPs. \n            ",

It's probably not the Halloween treat you were looking for, but now that the end of the month has come, that's exactly what's happened: Right now, more than 20 of Disney's channels have gone dark on YouTube TV.Why did Disney pull its Channels from YouTube TV?Not to be confused with YouTube Premium, YouTube TV is Google's Live TV service—kind of like cable without the cable box. As such, it needs to pay content providers like Disney fees to offer their channels, and that sometimes means disputes arise over how high those fees should be. While neither company has given insight into specific numbers, the gist seems to be that Disney wants to raise its fees, and Google doesn't want to pay up.It's a tough tightrope to walk. On Disney's end, the company told Variety that it feels like it's charging \"fair rates,\" and accused YouTube of potentially depriving its paying customers of channels they should rightfully be able to watch by not playing ball. On YouTube's side of things, the company argued that paying Disney's new rates would force it to \"raise prices on YouTube TV.\"Throw in that Disney has its own Live TV service, Hulu + Live TV, and there's also a potential anticompetitive angle at play, which Google was happy to point out, noting the proposed fee increase \"directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their [Disney's] own live TV products.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhich Disney Channels Have Been Pulled From YouTube TV?This isn't the first time YouTube TV has had to negotiate fees with content providers, and it's been able to avoid losing access to channels from the likes of Paramount, Fox Corp., and NBC Universal in the past. But with Disney negotiations falling through, this is one of the bigger losses of content YouTube TV subscribers have had to face in years. The full list of channels pulled from the service includes:ABCESPNESPN2ESPNUESPNewsDisney ChannelDisney JuniorDIsney XDFreeformFXFXXFXMSEC NetworkNat GeoNat Geo WildABC News LiveACC NetworkLocalishAdditionally, if you're on the YouTube TV Spanish plan, you've also lost access to the following channels:ESPN DeportesBaby TV EspañolNat Geo MundoWhen will Disney's channels come back to YouTube TV?If there's a silver lining, it's that the loss of Disney channels on YouTube TV probably isn't permanent. A similar blackout happened in 2021, for similar reasons, and lasted less than a week.That said, a direct timeline on restoring Disney's content to YouTube TV isn't yet available. In an update to its initial warning, YouTube said that Disney is \"now following through on their threat,\" and that \"we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV.\" As before, the platform also promised subscribers a $20 credit if Disney content \"remains off YouTube TV for an extended period of time,\" though it's currently unclear how long \"an extended period of time\" actually is. Notably, $20 is enough to subscribe to a month of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle with ads.On Disney's, end, a banner on the top of the Disney+ Help Center currently points users confused about losing access to the company's channels to a site called keepmynetworks.com, which suggests other ways of accessing Disney's TV content and urges disgruntled customers to reach out to YouTube directly, as well as post about the blackout on social media.Other Live TV services that offer Disney ChannelsWhile YouTube TV has lost access to Disney's content for now, other services continue to offer it, including Disney's own Hulu + Live TV. However, while Hulu + Live TV is cheaper than YouTube TV for the first three months ($64.99 vs. $72.99,) it is more expensive afterwards ($89.99 vs. $82.99).Because the content blackout is likely to be temporary, a potential short-term fix might be the Sling Orange plan, which offers day passes for $5 a pop, and allows access to ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPN4K, Freeform, and Disney Channel.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

When you don’t get all your tasks done, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and disappointed in yourself, which doesn’t help you push through to finish those tasks, let alone feel like you’re thriving.You should be happy. You need to be productive. Reaching a state of zen can help you accomplish both—or so goes the theory behind the “Zen to Done” method, which aims to help you get more good and feel good about it. Unlike some other productivity approaches, this one has less to do with strict deadlines and weedy details than it does with pushing through and feeling good about a job well done. This makes it well suited to those who don't exactly blossom under pressure.What is Zen to Done?Zen to Done is a productivity system conceptualized by Zen Habits’ Leo Babauta. It’s structured around building simple habits that enable you to get your work done and feel good at the same time. Other methods, like the once ubiquitous “Getting Things Done” system, get a bad rap for expecting you to build all your new habits at once, jumping immediately into a whole new lifestyle. That sort of all-or-nothing change can work for some people, but it might not be for you. But ZTD is focused on building them incrementally and more peacefully. There's room to adjust and grow, which can be soothing—especially if you have a lot of habits to change or you're particularly stuck in your ways.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe habit changes come in a series, but one at a time, allowing you to focus on the actual work you need to get done. In the original version of ZTD, there are 10 habits, but you should only try to incorporate two to three of them at one time before moving on to others.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCollect by always taking notes about what you need to do, ideas you have, or changes to a task or project.Process by making quick decisions on tasks that are in front of you right now, like emails that could soon pile up. Plan by setting goals for your week every Monday, and tackling larger tasks earlier in the week.Do by selecting a task and focusing on it without thinking about or doing anything else. Create a simple trusted system that works for you, like doing certain tasks at the same time every day or tapping into an email system like the 4Ds with consistenc.Organize by giving everything a place—and putting it there every time. This goes for emails, tools on your desk, and anything else that’s cluttering your mind or space. Review your weekly goals at the end of the week, but also keep tabs on your longer-term quarterly or annual goals to keep them fresh in your mind and see how your daily work plays into them. Simplify by using your review time to slash your goals and tasks into only what’s most essential at any given time. Make a routine that works for you, whether it’s a calmer morning routine, or  more structured evenings—and absolutely stick to it. Find your passion and make sure it’s guiding your work. This is where ZTD differs from other productivity methods: You should always strive to keep the things you care about at the center of what you’re doing, as a reminder of why you’re working so hard or a check on whether a project is really worth it all.Over the past year, I've adopted a few of these changes: collect (and, by extension, plan), plus process and organize. I've been dedicated to growing financially and becoming more organized, but I knew neither of those things would happen overnight, so I started writing down \"to-dos\" whenever they popped into my head. I stick them in a note in my phone, reorganize the note every Monday, and check it every morning to see what I can do—then jump straight into the things that are attainable in that moment. The other day, I noticed my fan was dirty but I didn't have time to clean it write then, so I wrote a note—clean the fan—in my phone, and was able to follow up on it the next day without stressing. Making changes and getting things done bit by bit in this way has resulted in major financial wins and a significantly cleaner, more organized home. It's a far cry from how things went in the past, when I put too much pressure on myself to change instantly. Get started with “Minimalist ZTD”All of that sounds like a lot—and it is, even though you’re only supposed to start rolling in the habits one at a time. So pull back a bit: Babauta considers the first four (collect, process, plan, and do) the core of a “Minimalist ZTD” program, and advises picking one of them and focusing on it for 30 days. After a month, you’ll be in the habit of using that approach to your work and can move on to one of the other three. And once the four big are securely ingrained in your habits, you can move on to the full list.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Sure, the part of the phone you interact with most is the touchscreen, so maybe it doesn't seem like such a big deal. But think about it: The side button, volume buttons, Action button, and Camera Control button would no longer click. Could you live without the clutter? While Apple sells no such iPhone, and likely won't release one next year, it very well might roll out a buttonless iPhone in 2027—at least, physically buttonless.  That year will mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, and it'll come as no surprise that rumors suggest Apple is planning something special for the \"iPhone 20.\" And that something might include ditching all the mechanical buttons and replacing them with haptics.A truly buttonless iPhoneIf you owned an iPhone 7 or iPhone 8, you'll understand the idea here. Those iPhones replaced the mechanical Home button with a solid state haptic button. Essentially, Apple used clever haptic vibrations to create the illusion of a button press, but, in fact, the \"button\" doesn't move at all. You'll realize this if the phone is completely off: The once pressable Home button doesn't actually do anything. It's the same case with any MacBook released over the past decade: Your trackpad isn't actually a button, so when the computer is off, the glass doesn't move.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe suggestion that the iPhone 20 will replace all of its buttons with this type of tech comes from leaker Instant Digital, who has previously claimed Apple intend to build a button-free iPhone. In the past, Instant Digital only confirmed vague plans by Apple to create such a phone sometime in the future, but this week, the leaker was more definitive: In a post on Weibo, Instant Digital asserted that Apple has \"completed functional verification\" for these haptic buttons, and is planning for \"mass production and application\" with the iPhone 20. All of the buttons, from the Side button to the Camera Control buttons, would adopt this technology. Interestingly, Instant Digital claims Apple will bridge the gap by simplifying the structure of the Camera Control button in next year's iPhone 18. Apple might remove the capacitive sensing layer of the button and keep just the pressure sensitivity. We'll have to see whether other rumors confirm this.Would you buy a buttonless iPhone 20?The iPhone 20 unveil is nearly two years away, and all rumors should be taken with a grain of salt. Apple might have big plans in store for this iPhone, but haptic buttons might not have anything to do with them. But let's assume for the sake of argument that Apple does exactly what Instant Digital suggests. Would you buy it?This would be a fundamentally different experience from any other iPhone, or really, any other smartphone. Even if you once had an iPhone with a haptic Home button, you've always had physical buttons to control the volume, to call up Siri, or to shut down your device. Those experiences would feel different, and could be more difficult to use just by feel alone, unless Apple makes each \"button\" physically obvious. It also calls into question how one would perform any hardware tasks that currently require physical buttons. Once Apple removed the physical Home button, you couldn't use it to reset the iPhone, so Apple gave the volume button that job instead. But if all buttons aren't really buttons anymore, how would you reset the iPhone if the screen becomes unresponsive? Plug it into a computer? Take it to an Apple Store? Say a prayer? My guess is Apple will have a solution, but at the moment, it's not clear what it would be. Personally, I don't think the change would influence my buying decision one way or the other. I'm hopelessly stuck in Apple's ecosystem, so I'll likely upgrade whenever my current iPhone bites the dust. If my options at that point include an iPhone without buttons, so be it, but I wonder if other iPhone users feel the same.

    "body": "\n        \n        If you're getting more scam texts than your friends and family, it turns out it might be your mobile platform, at least going by a recent poll from Google and YouGov. According to Google, users on Android report receiving 58% fewer scam texts than those on iOS, and that number is even better on Pixel devices.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nThat data comes from a survey Google and YouGov conducted of over 5,000 Android and iOS users across the U.S., India, and Brazil. The data says that Android users as a whole were \"58% more likely than iOS users\" to report that they had not received any scam texts in the week prior to the survey, and that iOS users were 65% more likely than Android users to report getting three or more scam texts in a week. On the whole, it also says that Android users were 20% more likely to describe their device's scam protection features as \"very effective\" or \"extremely effective.\"As for Pixel vs. iPhone specifically, the survey also found that Pixel users were 96% more likely to report zero scam texts than iPhone users, and that iPhone users were 136% more likely to say they had received \"a heavy volume of scam messages\" than Pixel users, as well as 150% more likely to say their device was \"not effective at all in stopping mobile fraud.\"\nThose numbers don't look good for Apple, although it's worth pointing out a few details before taking Google at its word.What is YouGov?First, to Google's credit, it didn't conduct this study alone. While the company didn't go into detail on how it partnered with YouGov here, YouGov itself is a respectable entity, widely cited in market research and even political news. The organization specializes in polls, and has been cited in everything from the New York Times to Lifehacker sister publication Mashable. It's also worth pointing out that YouGov wasn't the only independent entity Google worked with while putting together its report. The company also reached out to Counterpoint Research to evaluate its AI-powered anti-scam protections, and Leviathan Security Group to asses scam protection across four Android phones. The company used these studies to put together infographics depicting its security features vs. iPhone's, which you can see below.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nNote, however, how Google has put together the information here. Specifically, it implies that iPhone does not offer any scam protections in emails, while ignoring that many iPhone users access their email through the same Gmail app as on Android. It also doesn't mention Safari's ability to block pop-ups or the iPhone's ability to screen phone calls, which makes me think Google might be getting choosy with how its presenting the data here. As such, it's worth looking at its survey results with a critical eye as well.Questions about methodologyWhile Google's survey results are likely accurate to the polled audience, I do have a few questions about the methodology. First, there's the issue with this being a survey, rather than a more dispassionate look at texting inboxes. While helpful for getting insight into how users perceive their devices, surveys are susceptible to the word of those surveyed, which means that can be swayed by respondents misremembering details or misunderstanding questions.The bigger question to me, though, is sample size. While I commend Google for conducting its survey across three different regions, the company was not clear about how many of its respondents owned iPhones vs. Android devices. It's possible that iPhone users might have reported more scams simply because the iPhone is more popular in the U.S., for instance. To be fair, those numbers are reversed in India and Brazil, but without knowing a breakdown of how many people Google and YouGov interviewed where, it's hard to know if the data is being impacted by other factors.For instance, in addition to potentially being more numerous depending on a breakdown of the surveyed population, iPhone users might also be more susceptible to scam texts simply because scammers might want to target that user base more, as was once the case with viruses on Windows. The iPhone is known as a luxury device, which implies its user base might have extra money to spend, making it an alluring target.Can you believe Google's survey?So, can you take Google's polling at its word? Yes and no.With YouGov helping the company out, it's likely that the results presented are truthful, although they could still be misleading. The only way to know for sure would be to look at a detailed breakdown of the survey itself, but unlike the Counterpoint Research and Leviathan Security Group evaluations, there doesn't seem to be a way to look at the raw survey data at the moment, just Google's blog reporting on its findings.I've reached out to Google and YouGov independently with questions about their methodology, and did not immediately hear back. For good measure, I've also reached out to Apple for its take, and similarly am still waiting for a reply.In the meantime, I would take this survey with a grain of salt. It's almost certainly based in truth, but it's important to remember that it's still part of a larger advertising narrative.Google has made a big deal as of late about calling Apple's ecosystem a walled garden. If the company can convince users that it can offer them greater freedom while also upping their protection, that would be a big win. It does, however, coincide with Android's own efforts to close itself off in the name of security, so maybe the truth is both platforms aren't so different after all.\n            ",

A few methods that originated in Japan have proven especially popular—consider the Toyota-approved Kanban scheduling method—including one of my favorites: kaizen. The man who took the philosophy mainstream, Masaaki Imai, died two years ago, but left behind a legacy of productivity and efficiency we can all learn from, because this technique not only helps you get more done, but helps you do everything better. What is kaizen?In Japanese, “kaizen” translates, essentially, to “improvement,” and that’s the goal at the heart of the method itself, which encourages individuals at all levels of an organization to work together to continuously improve everything about a company. When everyone from the boss to the intern is in on the plan, the idea goes, the place will simply be more efficient and everything will always be getting better. This is done through standardization and the implementation of uniform processes.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nA good example of this is within the Toyota production system: If there is any issue or abnormality detected by any worker in a factory, they stop the production line and employees and supervisors work together to resolve the problem. As Toyota puts it, this “humanizes the workplace” and the standardization involved empowers every individual in the organizational structure to make meaningful changes. This is all part of a system called Plan, Do, Check, Act (usually known as PDCA), which works perfectly within a kaizen framework. The PDCA cycle repeats, meaning once you’ve planned, you keep doing, checking, acting, and planning again, factoring in your results, so you’re always improving. (If you're familiar with an after-action review, which calls on you to review what you did poorly and what you did well, then use that information to plan out how you'll improve in the future, that's a helpful framework for understanding PDCA.) And while you’re doing all that, you have to keep the kaizen principles themselves in mind. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow does kaizen work?In addition to incorporating PDCA, kaizen has its own set of five foundational principles:Know your customer: Cater to your customers or clients and take care to identify their needs and interests, plus how you can serve them from whatever level you’re at. Even a cashier who deals with one shopper at a time can have a broad, positive impact by making sure each is given detailed attention. A CEO who never deals directly with a customer can meet their needs by basing company decisions on data and feedback from buyers. In short, everyone and anyone can know the customer and serve them better. You can think broadly here: Maybe you don't have a \"customer\" per se, but your work can still require you to think of whomever you're doing that work for. Say you want to use kaizen to clean your home before your mom gets there for a week-long stay. Your mom is the \"customer\" you have to impress Let it flow: Eliminate waste, both physical and theoretical, meaning don’t take unnecessary steps, don’t clutter the space, and be direct in doing what you need to do. No matter what you're working on or how many people you're working with, this is where kanban can be a helpful complement, because it forces you to think over your action steps as you seek to meet a goal. Once you've identified what needs to be done and when, think of how you can scale each task back to only its most important, actionable elements. Go to Gemba: Gemba is the Japanese term for “actual place.” This means you should always be purposeful and direct about getting to where you need to be—which is likely to be where the action is happening. Don’t delegate anything you don’t have to, wait around on anything, or sit on the sidelines. Empower people: Encourage people in your organization, whether you’re their superior or they’re your peers, and make sure everyone is aligned in the common goals of the company and forward movement. If you're following a modified version of kaizen for a personal project, you can still take this step by not only giving yourself positive pep talks, but by making sure you have everything you need before you jump in. If you are working on that house-cleaning project, make sure you have all the right tools and are taking enough breaks that you don't burn out, for instance. Be transparent: Demonstrate your productivity with hard data and results and make sure everyone is always up to date on processes, developments, and goals. There are many ways to do this, even if you're working on your own. I personally love taking before and after pictures when I start and end a project, because seeing a finished product motivates me. Implementing all five of these in a working environment, per kaizen’s adherents, is the key to unlocking a culture of continuous improvement. If you want to learn more, there are dozens of books out there about the methodology, but you should start with the original: Masaaki Imai’s Kaizen: The Key to Japan’s Competitive Success. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which poses some serious privacy and security risks. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent. While OpenClaw's developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter \"Moltbook,\" a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I'm serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: \"The front page of the agent internet.\"Moltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who says the platform is run by their AI agent \"Clawd Clawderberg.\" Schlicht posted instructions on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to sign up for the site. Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create \"submolts.\"\nThis isn't a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can't post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its \"email-to-podcast\" pipeline it developed with its \"human,\" to another bot recommending that agents work while they're humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that. In fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. This bot supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can't see or use the chats the bots are having. Similarly, these two bots independently pondered creating an agent-only language to avoid \"human oversight.\" This bot bemoans having a \"sister\" they've never spoken to. You know, concerning. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre these bots posting on Moltbook conscious? The logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs—in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to \"guess\" what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you've spent enough time reading AI writing, you'll spot the telltale signs here, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I'm reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities. That said, it's tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let's hope it's the latter.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

News of the settlement was first reported by Reuters. Upon approval by a judge, the settlement could see Android users in the U.S. getting up to $100 each, provided they qualify.The settlement was filed in San Jose, California on Tuesday evening, and focused on claims that Google collected unnecessary cellular data from customers even when Google apps were closed, location-sharing was disabled, and screens were locked. The lawsuit alleges that Google collected the data with the intent of \"conversion,\" a legal term that in this case would likely mean using the captured data for product development and targeted advertising.Google denied any wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, agreed to not transfer data during Android set-up without consent from the user. The company will also initiate new toggles within Android to stop further cellular data transfers, and disclose any data transfers in its Google Play terms of service.\nAccording to Glen Summers, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, the $135 million payout is the largest ever in a conversion case. While the settlement is still awaiting approval from a judge, given Summers' comments, it's likely the plaintiffs will accept it. Here's how to determine if you can claim your slice of that pie.Who is eligible for a payment in the Android settlement?Google's settlement covers a fairly wide swath of users: anyone who has used an \"Android-powered mobile device\" since Nov 12, 2017. However, there appear to be a few caveats. Specifically, because the class-action applies to cellular data, it's unlikely to apply to users of any wifi-only devices, like many Android tablets. How much you can get in the Android settlementPayments for the class-action settlement cap out at $100 per class member, although it's unclear whether all users can expect to get that much. Reuters states that lawyers for the class-action may seek up to roughly 30% of the settlement in legal fees, and while there aren't any official numbers on how many Android users there are in the U.S., estimates from third-party firms place the count at roughly 40% of the mobile market overall. As such, $135 million might be spread pretty thin across all eligible class members.When payments could go outAn initial trial date for the case was originally scheduled for Aug. 5, although the judge could approve the settlement prior to then. Class-action settlements can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to be approved, in order to ensure the settlement is fair to all class members and doesn't show any signs of collusion.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow you'll know when a payment has been sentThe methods of contacting eligible class members varies from case to case. In some instances, payment is automatic. However, in many cases, a website is set up where users must file a claim, and physical mail and emails are sent out with PIN numbers and IDs to ensure as many class members know about their eligibility as possible. The company offering the settlement is often involved in sending out these notices, so if you believe you're affected, keep an eye out for an email or physical letter from Google, as well as for a settlement website to be set up. If you believe you're eligible but don't receive any communication, there will also usually be an email address you can contact. This email address will usually be specific to the case, and while it hasn't been revealed yet, it might be worth reaching out to Google Support if you're worried about missing any deadlines.Other current Google settlements you may qualify forGoogle's data collection settlement isn't its only big class action payout as of late. The company also recently agreed to pay $68 million in another settlement involving Google Assistant after an accusation that it listened in on users without their consent. Google also denied wrongdoing in this instance.If approved, the settlement will apply to anyone who had at least one device with Google Assistant pre-installed on it as early as 2016. Those who purchased the device will receive anywhere from $18 to $56, while those who lived in a household with one of these devices in it could earn $2 to $10. Steps for receiving your money will likely be similar to those in the Android data collection case.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

The app recently switched ownership from the Chinese-based ByteDance to the new \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture,\" which, as the name implies, is a majority American-owned business entity. Any changing of the guard comes with the risk for disruptions and issues, but it seems TikTok's problems have gone beyond the usual rocky transition. First, the app itself went down, which the company attributed to a power outage at a data center. Then, users accused the platform of updating its terms of service with aggressive new tracking, blocking certain content types, and \"shadowbanning\" new posts from some users. It's still not clear exactly what's going on here, but users aren't waiting around for more explanation. In fact, many have made up their minds already, and believe the app is actively suppressing content, neutering algorithms, and invading privacy in a way it didn't under ByteDance. While there are other, popular social media platforms to jump to, many apparently have flocked to a relatively new one: UpScrolled. As of this article, it's now the second most popular free app on the iOS App Store, reminding me of when X users ran to Bluesky. UpScrolled, created by Issam Hijazi, is a social media platform that launched this past June. According to the company's \"About\" page, UpScrolled's mission is to allow all users to share their views without risk of bias, shadowbanning, or \"unfair\" algorithms. The company asserts it does not push agendas, and ensures that \"every post has a fair chance to be seen.\" If you believe TikTok's algorithm is now biased against your views, I could see how that pitch sounds enticing. \nThe company says it only restricts content that violates their guidelines. That means illegal activities, hate speech, bullying and harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted content, or anything \"intended to cause harm.\" UpScrolled will also never ban you without your knowledge. If the platform removes your videos or your account, it says it'll let you know why. One big difference between UpScrolled and other social media platforms is its algorithm. The app splits feeds into two: There's the Following Feed, which lists posts entirely in chronological order. The first posts are the newest from your followers, and you scroll through previous posts. If you want to find new posts from accounts you don't follow, you can use the Discover Feed. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, the Discover Feed does not employ some aggressive, personalized algorithm. Instead, it's based on likes, comments, and reshares. Popular posts from across the platform are shared with you  What I especially appreciate is UpScrolled's approach to data collection, in that they largely don't do it. The company says it doesn't sell user data to third-parties for marketing, tracking, or for profit. The only times they'll hand over user data is when compelled by law. That's in sharp contrast to many social media platforms, which seem to collect as much of your data as possible.I haven't spent much time with the app yet, though I did create an account this morning to see what the hullabaloo was all about. I don't recognize any of the users the app suggests I follow, which means I'll likely need to dig through the content types if I want to find accounts to start following. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Discover Feed is a mix of content types, but is heavy with content surrounding the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, many users are choosing the platform as a space for pro-Palestinian content, in response to allegations that mainstream social media apps censor these types of posts. That said, the app advertises a host of different content types to follow, including sports, news, games, film, music, tech, and travel. As you might expect, some of the posts here are simply ripped from TikTok, which is a common practice I see on social media platforms that, well, aren't TikTok. Despite the current controversy, it's clear which platform still has the largest user share at this time, by a long shot. But it's not all short-form videos. The app also includes plenty of posts of static images as well, which reminds me more of Instagram than TikTok. Still, it seems former TikTok users don't care that this isn't a one-to-one replica of the TikTok formula, and care more about sending a message to the app they once loved being addicted to. I'm not sure my limited journey with UpScrolled this morning will keep me hooked, but it's an interesting take on a social media platform. We'll just need to see if the growth will continue, or if this is just a momentary blip before people return to TikTok. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Before you head out to a protest, take some precautions to protect your privacy and both the physical and digital security of any device you bring along. The most secure option, of course, is to leave your phone at home, but you can also lock things down to minimize the risk that your data will be accessible to law enforcement or someone who gets hold of your device. Thankfully, both iOS and Android have built-in device encryption if you're using a passcode, meaning that your device's data cannot be accessed when it is locked. (On Android, go to Settings > Security to ensure Encrypt Disk is enabled). You'll want to maximize this protection with the following privacy settings. Turn off face and fingerprint scanningAt an absolute minimum, you'll want to disable biometric access, such as face and fingerprint authentication, on your device in favor of a passcode or PIN. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, this minimizes the risk of being physically forced to unlock your device and may provide stronger legal protections against compelled decryption. \nOn iOS, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off iPhone Unlock. You can also set up a stronger passcode—a custom numeric or alphanumeric code—under Change Passcode. On Android, you'll find the option to delete your fingerprint in favor of your PIN or screen lock pattern under Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Fingerprint.Limit location trackingAgain, the best option to prevent your location from being tracked is to coordinate any details in advance and leave your phone at home. If you must bring it along, keep it off unless you absolutely need to use it. You can turn on Airplane Mode in advance, as well as disable Bluetooth, wifi, and location services, which keeps your device from transmitting your location. However, note that some apps may still be able to store GPS data and transmit it when an internet connection is available—so again, the safest bet is to keep your device off for the duration. Airplane Mode can be enabled (and wifi and Bluetooth disabled) in your device's settings or quick access menu. On Android, go to Settings > Location to disable location services and turn off Location History in your Google account. On iOS, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services to disable locations entirely. Turn off previews and notificationsTemporarily disable notifications and screen previews so that if someone gets your device, they won't be able to glean any information from your lock screen. You can adjust these options under Settings > Notifications on iOS and Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications on Android. Adjust screen lock timeMinimize your screen lock time to as short a period as possible so that your screen turns off when you're not actively using it and will require authentication to reopen. On iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and select 30 seconds. The exact path on Android may vary, but typically you'll find this under Settings > Display or Lock Screen. Know that most devices have camera access from the lock screen, so you can take photos or record video without actually unlocking your device. Enable app pinning or Guided AccessApp pinning (Android) and Guided Access (iOS) are features that prevent others from navigating through your phone beyond a specific app or screen. This allows you to use an essential feature on your device while locking the rest behind your PIN or passcode. You can enable this preemptively, and if someone grabs your device, they won't be able to snoop around. You can find this setting on Android under Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and on iOS under Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse a SIM PINYou can also lock your SIM card to prevent unauthorized use of your device or SIM card, including access to two-factor authentication codes sent via SMS. This PIN will be required any time your phone restarts or if someone tries to use your SIM card in another device. On iOS, go to Settings > Cellular, select your SIM, and tap SIM PIN. On Android, you'll find this under Settings > Security > More security settings (the exact path varies by device). Sign out of, hide, or delete appsThis step will vary depending on what you keep on your phone and your risk tolerance, but you may want to consider signing out of your social media accounts and deleting apps that contain or allow access to sensitive data. On iOS, you can also lock or hide specific apps: the former requires an extra authentication step to open apps on your home screen, while the latter sends apps to a hidden folder that also requires authentication to unlock. Touch and hold an app icon to bring up the quick actions menu, then tap Require Face ID/Require Passcode.  On Android, you can set up a \"private space\" to lock apps behind your pattern, PIN, or password. Apps are hidden from the launcher and recent views as well as quick search. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > Private space, authenticate with your screen lock, and tap Set up > Got it. If necessary, turn on Lockdown Mode or Advanced ProtectionBoth iOS and Android have strict device-level security modes that significantly limit access to certain app and web features as well as blocking changes to settings. Both were designed with journalists, activists, and other users with access to sensitive data that may be targeted by cyber actors in mind. These settings are overkill for day-to-day use but add a potentially helpful layer of security in high-risk situations. Enable Lockdown Mode on iOS via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. On Android, turn on Advanced Protection under Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.Protect your privacy after a protestWhile the above steps are largely about securing your data during a protest, you should also follow best practices for protecting privacy (yours and others') after the fact. If you plan to post photos or videos, utilize blurring tools to block faces and other unique identifying features, and scrub file metadata, which includes information like photo location. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the image to post or sending a copy to yourself in Signal, which automatically strips metadata. Signal also has a photo blurring tool, or you can blur in your device's default photo editing app. \n            ",

Sometimes, I cover Windows and streaming, too!\n        \n        \n            Areas of Expertise\n        \n        Read Full Bio\n    \n\n    \n                            \n        \n        \n        January 28, 2026\n            \n            \n                        Credit: René Ramos/Lifehacker Composite/Adobe Stock\n                            \n    \n        \n        The launch of the Google TV Streamer marked a significant shift for the company's streaming lineup, moving away from the behind-the-TV Chromecast dongles it popularized and introducing a pill-shaped set-top box that blends in nicely on a shelf of tchotchkes. It's hiding a worthy processor, double the memory you'd get from a streaming stick, and enough storage to download what you need to run all of your apps. It even acts as a smart hub, with Matter and Thread built in. It's taken me a long time to do anything with the Google TV Streamer. I reluctantly brought it into my home after realizing something more robust, but dated, like the Nvidia Shield, would be too much to manage alongside maintaining a home server. But since then, I've tweaked several things on the set-top box and enabled features I hadn't been using, turning it into a helpful hub in my living room.Enable \"Find my remote\" to never lose your Google TV Streamer remote againThis sounds like an obvious tip, but I've had the Google TV Streamer since it debuted in 2024, and it wasn't until this week, while writing this piece, that I finally enabled the remote finder. I had skipped it during the initial setup. The option is available in Settings > Remotes & Accessories. You'll see the Find my remote option in there.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThe Google TV Streamer has a physical button on the back of the device that lets you locate your remote if it's stuck somewhere on the couch. But what if you can't reach the streamer behind the TV? Try one of your Google-enabled voice devices instead. If you have a Nest speaker or a Pixel phone nearby, say \"Hey Google, find my remote.\" The remote should start chirping if you've set it up.Set up the Google TV Streamer remote shortcutThe remotes that come with the Google TV Streamer feature a tiny, unregistered button with a star icon right next to the power button. By default, this shortcut does nothing! But you can change that in the device's system preferences.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIn Settings > Remotes & Accessories > Set up remote buttons, select one of three options for customizing the shortcut button. I set it up as my Google Home shortcut so I can easily turn the lights on and off from the couch. You can also set it up as a launcher for another app installed on the set-top box. Or create a shortcut to cycle through device inputs—this button is on legacy Chromecast devices with an included remote. It was removed from this generation of streaming devices, so if you miss it, you can spoof it back.For serious power users, map the shortcut to an app like Projectivity Launcher to make it a more powerful launcher button.Remap other buttons on your Google TV Streamer remote to be more useful\n    \n            \n            What Button Mapper looks like running on Google TV.\n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nDon't care for the default YouTube or Netflix buttons included on the Google TV Streamer remote? You can remap them with a third-party app, then affix a small sticker to indicate what it does. Install an app like Button Mapper or tvQuickActions. Then go to Google TV Settings > System > Accessibility, and turn on the service. After that, you can head back into the app to adjust what those physical buttons do. You can set them as shortcuts to other apps, or even something cheekier for others to discover when they press the button. Remove the clutter from the Google TV Streamer home screen\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nCan't stand all the recommendations and sponsored content Google TV suggests in the main carousel? You can effectively shut off some of the clutter so it doesn't visually overwhelm you. Go to Settings > Accounts & Sign-In > Your Account. and toggle on Apps only mode.This clears the clutter and \"sponsored\" content, leaving you with just app icons. Keep in mind that this turns off the \"Watchlist\" feature that's tied to your account and some Gemini voice search capabilities for specific content.Enable Google TV Streamer \"Developer options\" for more customization \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou'll need to enable developer options to enable features like faster animations and side-loading apps. It's easy to set up, and it's just like on an Android smartphone. Head into Settings > System > About, then tap Android TV OS Build 7 times.You'll see a little dialog pop up to let you know you've got developer access. Once enabled, a new menu will appear under Settings > System > Developer options.Limit animations to make navigation fasterThe Google TV interface is organized and functional, but its animations can slow down menu navigation. You can eliminate these animations and tweak other visual elements to speed things up deep within the developer settings.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIn Developer Options, scroll down to Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. Change one of these, or all three, from 1x to Animation off to turn off animations completely. You can also go the other way and effectively \"overclock\" the animations to speed them up, making them appear smoother. Side-load apps or an alternative launcherWith developer options turned on, you can enable USB and wireless debugging to use apps like Send Files to TV and atvTools to sideload APKs. But first, enable the \"Allow installs from unknown sources\" option in the Developer Options under Security settings. This allows APKs you've transferred over to the device to run on the streamer.Why would you want to go through the fuss of connecting to the Google TV Streamer this way? Because then you could access alternative streaming apps not available in the Play Store, or even an alternative launcher, like LeanbackLauncher.Pair headphones to your Google TV Streamer for private listening\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Florence Ion/Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThis is one of my favorite little hacks that comes especially in handy when living in a house occupied by other people. When I do my workouts in the living room, I use a set of Bluetooth earbuds connected to the Google TV Streamer so I can hear the instructor's directions even when I'm face down in a plank and my kid is screaming in the background.The ability is available in the same submenu where you set up your remote. In Settings > Remote & Accessories > Pair Remote/Accessory, put your audio device into Bluetooth pairing mode, then watch it come up on the screen as an option. If you're successful, you can now pop on the buds when you need to. Be aware that audio latency can occur, and you might need to restart the connection—it is Bluetooth, after all.  Force your Google TV Streamer to choose the best resolution, regardless of bandwidthIf you don't care about your bandwidth and want full-resolution streaming at all times, you can set the best resolution to display as the default in your Google TV Streamer preferences. Go to Settings > Display & Sound > Resolution. Switch the Resolution from \"Automatic\" to 4K 60Hz, or whatever your TV's peak is. Once this is enabled, the Google TV Streamer won't downscale to 1080p. If you're a sucker for HDR, this is the same menu where you can turn it on so that it's always in high definition.The USB-C port can do more than charge up the Google TV Streamer. You can plug in a power delivery hub with extra ports to add components like external storage and effectively run your own all-in-one home media center. Those power delivery hubs usually include extra USB ports for peripherals, so you can hook up things like keyboards and game controllers for extra fun.  \n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Florence Ion\n                                I cover Android, smartphones, and the smart home.

But if you’re looking to dip your toe into this world without dropping major cash, the Roborock Q7 L5 robot vacuum and mop is a low-stakes entry-level option that checks many boxes, and right now it’s at a record-low 44% off at $139.99 (originally 249.99) on Amazon, according to price-trackers.  \nThe Q7 L5 has 8,000 Pa HyperForce suction (surprisingly powerful for this price point), multiple anti-tangle brushes, LiDAR navigation, and multi-floor mapping. It also has a mopping feature, which is rare at the under-$150 price point; the 270 ml water tank allows the device to vacuum and mop simultaneously. Some reviews also note that the mopping function can leave floors slightly wet, which is something to keep in mind for people with delicate floor surfaces.Like pricier models, you can customize zones, schedules, and suction levels via the Roborock app, but it’s worth noting that this vacuum only supports 2.4 GHz wifi. The dual anti-tangle system is especially appealing for pet owners, and navigation runs smoothly and efficiently with obstacle avoidance, as well as suggesting no-go zones to avoid getting stuck. Compared to more feature-rich mop and vacuum hybrids, the dock on the base is compact and has a water tank and dustbin as a single integrated part in the machine, making it a good choice for people with smaller homes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile it doesn’t have the automation bells and whistles of pricier models, for $139.99, it’ll perform most everyday cleaning jobs effectively. If you’re a first-time robot vacuum buyer or have a specific budget and are looking for a robot vacuum to help automate your cleaning sessions, the Roborock Q7 L5 robot vacuum and mop will give you strong value without breaking the bank.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Reports started as early as last September and gained traction last week, and now, Google has removed the feature on some older phones.Called \"Take a Message,\" the buggy feature was released last year and is supposed to automatically transcribe voicemails as they're coming in, as well as detect and mark spam calls. Unfortunately, according to reports from multiple users on Reddit (as initially spotted by 9to5Google), the feature has started turning on the microphone while taking voicemails, allowing whoever is leaving you a voicemail to hear you. Audio leaks are bad in any circumstance, but they must feel especially nasty if you're trying to pretend you're not there.Affected users have have found that while the caller can hear the audio from the person receiving the voicemail, there's no indication on the receiver's end that their audio can be heard, aside from the green microphone indicator possibly turning on.\nThe issue has been reported affecting Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 4 to the Pixel 10, and on a recent support page, Google's finally acknowledging it. However, the company's action might not be enough, depending on how cautious you want to be.According to Community Manager Siri Tejaswini, the company has \"investigated this issue,\" and has confirmed it \"affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and 5 devices under very specific and rare circumstances.\" The post doesn't go any further on the how and why of the diagnosis, but says that Google is now disabling Take a Message and \"next-gen Call Screen features\" on these devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNext-gen Call Screen is a separate feature that allows Google's AI to ask a caller their name and the purpose of their call before taking a message. No bugs have been reported for it, but Google says it's disabling both features out of \"an abundance of caution.\"While this should prevent the issue from popping up for users with those phones, it's a bit of a heavy-handed fix. I've reached out to Google to check if Take a Message is only being removed temporarily while the company fixes the bug, or if it will now be permanently gone. In the meantime, Tejaswini does say that Pixel 4 and 5 owners will still be able to use manual and automatic Call Screening, which provide basic protection against spam. The post also suggests that affected users can rely on any call screening features provided by their cellular carriers.How to disable Take a Message on your Pixel phoneWhile it's encouraging that Google is taking action on the Take a Message bug, the company only seems to be acknowledging it for Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 models, at least for now. I've asked Google whether owners of other Pixel models should be worried, as user reports seem split on this. Still, because some have mentioned an issue with even the most up-to-date Pixel phone, if you want to practice your own abundance of caution, it might be worth disabling Take a Message on your device, regardless of its model number.To do this, open your Phone app, then tap the three-lined menu icon at the top-left of the page. Navigate to Settings > Call Assist > Take a Message, and toggle the feature off.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I remember spending a whole semester in one half of my university’s gym because the other room was, I don’t know, scary. And if you haven’t been to the gym in a while—or ever—you probably have questions. So let’s talk through the very, very basics. What is a gym even like inside?Hey, great question! There are different kinds of gyms, so there isn’t a single, universal answer. I’ll assume you’re going to what’s sometimes called a “commercial” gym, one that caters to a wide variety of people and has a selection of cardio machines, weight-training machines, and dumbbells. It may or may not have barbells. Planet Fitness, Crunch, LA Fitness, Gold’s Gym, and 24 Hour Fitness are all in this general category. If your gym is in a community center or a YMCA, it may have a few more or less features, but will probably be similar to what I describe.Before you head in, check the gym’s website. Most will offer a free first day or week, which will let you scope the place out and do a workout or two before you commit to a membership. Some gyms may make it difficult to cancel after you sign up, so don't rush into it. Take advantage of those trial periods.While you're doing your research, check out the website for virtual tours and photos of facilities. Get an idea of what kind of stuff they have. Check Google Maps for photos; you may even be able to find a Street View-style tour of the interior. And finally, log on to Instagram and browse through photos tagged at that gym's location. You’ll get a sense of what equipment is there, how people train, and what kind of vibe to expect. What do I bring?You can come to a gym with nothing and still get in a good workout. The only absolute requirement, in some gyms, is that you bring a pair of shoes that aren’t filthy. (Some gyms disallow street shoes, and expect you to change into a clean pair; others don’t care, or only enforce the policy in winter.) On the other end of the spectrum, people will often bring a complete change of clothes and a bunch of toiletries and supplies to take a shower and change afterward. You don’t have to do this. It’s OK to walk out the front door still sweaty, and shower at home. Some small gyms don’t even have showers.What’s the middle ground? I would bring these for my first time at a new gym: A water bottleA small towel (for sweat), unless I know for sure that the gym provides towelsHeadphonesA clean(ish) pair of shoesA bag to carry everything inA combination lock if you plan to lock your things up and aren’t sure whether the gym’s lockers have built-in locksWhat do I do with my stuff while I’m there?If you have a bunch of stuff, like a coat and a bag, you can put it in a locker. It’s also totally fine to keep a few things with you as you walk around. Most people will probably have their towel, water bottle, and phone with them. You can usually bring a small bag around the gym with you, and just set it down next to whatever machine or bench you’re using, as long as it’s not directly in anybody’s way. (Check the gym rules, though.) Since that can be a hassle, another popular approach is to keep your water bottle in a sleeve that has pockets for your phone and small items.What do I wear?Anything that feels comfortable, isn’t indecent, and that you don’t mind sweating in. For your upper body, try a T-shirt or tank top. For your legs, wear shorts, sweatpants, or leggings. Again, check the gym rules to see if they have any specific requirements. Some gyms don’t want you to take your shirt off, others don’t care. For shoes, any kind of sneakers or comfortable athletic shoes should be fine. Chucks, running shoes, that sort of thing. If you get really into this exercise business, you can get picky about shoes later. For your first day, it doesn’t really matter.So do you just, like, walk in?There will be some kind of check-in desk. If it’s your first time, you’ll probably need to talk to somebody about a membership trial or buy a day pass. This can be a separate visit from your first actual workout. Make sure to ask what the normal check-in procedure is. In many cases you’ll scan your phone or show a key tag or card as you enter, and then you’re free to do whatever you want. How do I know what they have and where it is?Two options here: you can walk around the room and scope everything out; or you can ask if someone can give you a brief tour or new-member orientation. (They may offer before you ask). Be aware that they may try to upsell you on personal training or other extras in the process; it's OK to decline.If you do get a guided tour, use this opportunity to ask any remaining questions you have. Don’t be embarrassed, the whole idea is that they know you’re new and they’re trying to help. And if you don't get a tour, it's still OK to ask basic questions at the front desk like \"which way to the locker room?\" or \"do you have squat racks?\" What if this whole idea makes me nervous?Look, the first day is about expanding your comfort zone. If you can walk into the gym and not run right back out, you’ve already accomplished something, and Day Two will be so much easier. A few things that tend to help:Go at one of the less busy times if that will help your nerves. Mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and late evenings tend to be slow times. Check Google Maps to see if it can show you peak hours at your particular location. Bring a friend, or meet a friend there if you can. Even if both of you are new and clueless, you can be new and clueless together. Read up on what to expect. You’re already doing that, so you’re on the right track! If there’s a certain exercise or machine you want to try, look it up on YouTube.If your gym offers classes, that can be a good way to start. The class will get you in the gym with a clear plan of where to go and what to do. You can save independent workouts for after the class or for another day. If you’ll be on your own, try this: Walk around the whole gym. Scope everything out. Nobody will stop you or judge you. You don’t even have to pretend that you know where you’re going; if anybody asks “can I help you?” you can just reply “Oh, I’m just new here and seeing where everything is.” Sit on an exercise bike (or the machine of your choice). Ideally, pick one that faces the main gym area so you can gather more information about what equipment is out there and what people do with it. Use that machine while you decide on your next steps.Maybe this is enough. A typical cardio workout is 20 to 30 minutes, so you can just use the bike for a half hour and then go home. Or maybe you find your confidence building as you pedal. After five or 10 minutes (a typical warmup time), hop off the bike and go check out the dumbbells or machines or whatever has piqued your interest.Take the free personal training session if you want, but beware the upsellMost gyms sell personal training for an extra fee. And as an enticement to get people to sign up, they may offer a free session or a fitness test with one of their trainers. Like the tour, this is also a good time to get some questions answered. You can do this if you like, but proceed with caution. Some gyms and trainers are great, but others will use this opportunity to make you do a lot of hard exercise so that you feel out of shape, and then you’ll feel like you need their services to get into shape. I’ve heard too many stories of people having one of these sessions and then feeling terrible about themselves afterward.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSo if you decide to go ahead with a session, keep your wits about you. You do not have to be fit your first day in the gym. You also don’t have to do a really demanding workout your first day. If the trainer has you do anything you’re uncomfortable with, you don’t even have to know why you feel the way you do about it. You can just say “you know what, I don’t think I’m ready to do that right now” and ask to move on. This is also a good test of your trainer. If they try to force you to do something you’re not cool with, you probably won’t have a good time working with them.And, of course, never sign up for anything you aren't sure you want. If they say you'll get a better deal if you join right now, that's a hint that they only get people to sign up when pressured, which means it's probably not a good deal at all. If you do sign up for a package of sessions, read the fine print to make sure that whatever they tell you about cancellations is actually written there in the contract. (Overwhelmed? Better to just say no for now. You can always sign up later.)Can you give me a routine for my first day?Sure can! Although what makes something a routine is that you do it routinely. So I’ll give you an option for your first day’s workout, and you can even repeat it a few times, but eventually you’ll want to find yourself a program that lays out longer-term plans.Try this, which should give you a full-body workout in a reasonable length of time. If one machine or station is busy, just skip to the next while you wait.I’m recommending two sets of each exercise because that should give you a nice sampling without making you too sore the next day if this is all brand new. I’m recommending 10 reps in each set because 10 is an easy number to remember. Feel free to do more or less if you like. 5-10 minutes on an exercise bike (or any cardio machine)2x10 (that means two sets of 10 reps each) dumbbell or machine shoulder press2x10 on the assisted pull-up machine or lat pulldown2x10 walking lunges with dumbbells in your hands 2x10 dumbbell bench press or machine chest press2x10 seated cable row or dumbbell row2x10 goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell (if you’re feeling brave, give the leg press a try instead)5-10 minutes stretching anything that feels tight (look for a stretching area with mats on the floor)If you want an even shorter workout, split it in half. Do the shoulder press, pull-up or pulldown, and the lunges, and then skip right to stretching. Next time, go right to the dumbbell bench after you warm up, and continue the workout from there. You don’t have to memorize everything ahead of time. Machines almost always have instructions posted on them telling you how to adjust them and how to use them. Also, it is totally fine to look up videos of exercises on your phone, or to keep notes in your phone or on paper about what you did. It is always OK to be that guy with the notebook.What do I need to know about gym etiquette?If there are wipes and spray bottles around, wipe down anything you sweated on. This includes benches and the seats and handles of machines. Don’t forget to throw the wipe away afterward. You can also put your towel down on a bench or machine as a sweat barrier.Whatever you use, put it back when you’re done. It’s OK to rest a minute, or even a few minutes between sets. (For example, you just did 10 reps of bench press, and now you’re sitting on the bench for a few minutes before you do your next 10 reps.) But don’t take up space any longer than you need to. If somebody is using a thing you’d like to use, it’s OK to ask them “how many sets do you have left?” and if the answer is a lot, you can ask “Do you mind if I work in?” which means that you’ll take turns using the equipment. If somebody asks these questions of you, be honest about how many sets you have left (it’s OK to make them wait) and offer to let them work in if you feel comfortable doing so. If somebody offers you advice and you don’t know how to react, just say “OK.” If the advice is about following a gym rule, follow the rule. If it’s about how to properly use equipment, like adjusting a safety setting, take their advice. On the other hand, if it’s about the proper way to do an exercise, it’s 100% up to you whether you want to give their way a try or just go back to what you were doing. (I have a guide to responding to unsolicited advice.)What about the second day?It’s going to be so much easier the second day.

However, those with access to sensitive data that are valuable to threat actors may benefit.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts. For most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)As noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality. \nHow WhatsApp's Strict Account Settings protects high-risk usersStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on. Link previews are disabledHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blockedOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile. Only known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.How to enable Strict Account Settings on WhatsAppThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings. Settings must be changed on your primary device and cannot be updated on the web. Note that the feature will roll out gradually over the coming weeks, and may not be immediately available. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

There are other Android phones worth considering—from the likes of OnePlus and Nothing, for example—but Google and Samsung are the most well-known.While the fundamental operating system on Pixel and Galaxy phones is the same, there are numerous differences between these two flavors of Android. They're not all obvious, though, unless you spend every day with these handsets, and that can make it tricky to decide whether you're better off going with Google or Samsung.As it happens, I use Pixel and Galaxy phones every day, more or less—not because tech journalists are particularly wealthy, but because we have to write a lot of reviews, news stories, and how-to guides for our jobs. Here's what I've learned along the way, and how you can choose between Pixel phones and Galaxy phones.\nCustomization and clutterIn the old days we used to talk about \"stock\" Android on Google's Nexus or Pixel phones, but that doesn't really exist any more: Even Google puts its own twists and tweaks on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) that every Android manufacturer has access to. Samsung adds even more on top of the AOSP foundation, and markets its own take on Android as One UI.There's no doubt that One UI on Galaxy phones is busier and more complex than Android on Pixel phones—which can either be a positive or a negative, depending on how you like your mobile software. Samsung offers more settings, customizations, and configurations than Google, so One UI is going to appeal to power users.\n    \n            \n            Samsung's One UI gives you a lot of customization options.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGalaxy phones offer more in the way of theming options, for example, which completely transform the look of the software—though Pixels have caught up to some extent with features like icon theming in recent updates. You can do more on the lock screen with Samsung phones too, tweaking frames, widgets, and effects as needed.Google takes a simpler approach to the user interface—which you could praise as uncluttered or criticize as basic, depending on your perspective and taste. The Pixel version of Android has gotten a bit more polished over time, and has borrowed a few tricks from Samsung, but it's still not as customizable overall.Apps and ecosystem With Pixel phones, Google's apps are front and center. On a Galaxy phone, you get all of Google's key apps, and all of Samsung's equivalents, installed by default: So again, Galaxy phones are the more cluttered of the two. There's nothing wrong with Samsung's apps for photos, calendars, contacts, web browsing, and so on, but it's likely that most of the time you're going to prefer the Google option.That might change depending on what else you own: If you have a Galaxy Watch strapped to your wrist, then Samsung Health becomes far more useful and interesting. If you've gone for a Pixel Watch, then you're going to prefer the Google-owned Fitbit. As with most tech purchases these days, from TVs to smart speakers to laptops, you'll need to consider what else you own from Google or Samsung.\n    \n            \n            Pixels offer easier access to Google's many and varied apps.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGoogle does keep some features as exclusives for Pixel phones, though they often trickle out to the wider Android ecosystem over time. At the moment, they include Call Screen (for putting a barrier between you and spam calls), the real-time Scam Detection feature, Pixel Screenshots for analyzing your screengrabs, a Now Playing widget for the home screen, and photo features such as Night Sight.In some cases, Samsung has counterparts for those Pixel exclusives, and it has a few exclusives of its own that you don't get with Pixel phones. There's also the suite of Good Lock modules that take phone customization and tweaking to the next level: You can set different volume levels for different apps, design your own themes, and take more control over your home screen, for example.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHardware differences and updatesI don't want to talk too much about hardware differences, because these change regularly with each passing year (or even every six months), but there's no doubt that hardware design comes into play when you're choosing a smartphone—and broadly speaking, I think most people will agree that Samsung's phones are more sleek and stylish.Aesthetics are subjective, but the Samsung Galaxy series look closer to the polish and refinement of the iPhones, whereas Google takes a more simplified and industrial approach to its Pixels: Look at that chunky rear camera bar for example (which to be fair does help when a phone is laid flat).\n    \n            \n            Handsets like the Galaxy S25 are easy on the eye.\n                                        Credit: Samsung\n                    \n    \nPerformance is difficult to gauge, but it's fair to say that the Snapdragon (and even Exynos) chipsets that Samsung uses have a better reputation than the Tensor CPUs that Google puts in its Pixel phones. That said, there's an argument to be made that Google wins on camera lens quality, which is something the Galaxy series hasn't really moved the needle much on in recent years.What's indisputable is that Android updates roll out to Google phones several months before Samsung phones: Samsung needs time to adapt the AOSP code for its own One UI release, and so if you want to get the latest Android features before anyone else, the Pixel series is your best bet.My personal preferencesIf I'm buying a new Android phone for myself, I'll still usually go with a Google Pixel. The software interface is a little more rudimentary, but I don't mind that, and I use so many Google apps so regularly—Gmail, Google Chat, Google Maps, Google Keep—that I want the most friction-free and seamless access to them possible. I don't want or need a bunch of Samsung apps too. That's not to say Galaxy phones don't have their appeal, and I like tinkering around with some of the extra features and hacks you don't get with Pixels—like the secret wifi menu, for example, or the built-in easy mode. Ultimately, though, Pixels feel more intuitive and easier to use for me, and I absolutely want to be first in the queue for Android updates.\n    \n            \n            The Pixel 10 Pro Fold showing off Google's distinctive design language.\n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nAdmittedly, part of this is down to familiarity. I've been using Google phones more regularly for across a longer span of time than Samsung phones, and I'm used to them and the way they work—if you're a seasoned Galaxy phone owner, then the benefits of a Pixel probably won't have as much appeal, considering you're going to have to get used to a different set of options and menus.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Now, Google's here to help. Today, the company announced a big expansion of its existing Gemini in Chrome feature, with the highlights including a new look for the AI companion, more-integrated image editing tools, and, perhaps most impressive (but also creepy), the launch of Auto Browse, which lets Gemini take the wheel when you're going online.The new side panel view\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nPreviously, Gemini in Chrome appeared in a small box on top of your browser, which made it a bit inconvenient to use, especially when bouncing between tabs. Google's update moves it to a scrollable side panel view that's a bit bigger, and it won't obscure any of your other content. Instead, it'll sit to the right of the webpage your viewing, so you can more easily compare whatever answers Gemini gives you with what you're seeing, or carry on a conversation while bouncing between multiple tabs. It will retain all the same functionality as before, including the ability to reference multiple open tabs in prompts. It's a small change, but should help for usability.Right-click any image to edit it in Nano Banana\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle's Nano Banana image generation AI is having a bit of a moment, and the new Gemini in Chrome updates make it easier to use. Now, instead of having to download an image and re-upload it to Gemini, you can edit it using Nano Banana with a simple right click. Or, you could also use natural language to start an edit by pulling up the image you want to edit on your screen and telling Gemini to edit it in the side panel. Google says this should work with pretty much any image you can pull up on the browser.\nDuring a demo, Google showed this off to journalists using a Google Photos library, but there's nothing saying you have to stick to your own images. That immediately set off alarm bells for me, given Elon Musk's X is currently in hot water after opening up the ability for anyone to use Grok to edit other people's images directly on the social media platform and without their permission. After some users started using that tool to generate explicit content from others' photos, it was pared down a bit, but Google doesn't seem worried. When I asked about safety protections for this feature, a Google spokesperson told me the following:\"We have clear policies that prohibit the use of our AI tools to generate sexually explicit content, and our tools are continually getting better at reflecting these policies. We've invested in safety from the outset and added technical guardrails to help limit problematic outputs such as violent, offensive, or sexually explicit content.\"The company didn't say anything about how users might use Nano Banana in Chrome to circumvent copyright, but technically, the new update doesn't really add new features to Google's AI image generator, it just makes it easier to access. Granted, the same thing applied to Grok's recent update, too, and easier access can mean opening the floodgates, even if you have the best of intentions.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nFinally, the big one: \"Agentic\" has been the hot buzzword in AI as of late, and Google doesn't want Chrome to be left behind. So now, instead of just answering questions, Gemini can take control of your browser for you.The functionality is currently limited to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers, but starting today, those subscribers can ask Chrome to \"Auto Browse\"—completing research, taking you to different websites, and filling out forms for you. You can watch as the AI navigates around the web, or you can click away to a different tab while it works in the background. Multiple tabs can Auto Browse at the same time, so you can have a few tasks going on at once. The AI will list out the steps it takes in the side panel while it navigates around, to make checking in on it easier.Google demonstrated this to journalists by showing the AI finding a specific product, navigating to its store page, singing into the buyer's account (using Google Password Manager), and adding it to their cart. The company also suggested you could use Auto Browse to schedule appointments, fill out an online form using information from an uploaded PDF, collect tax documents, compare apartments listed on sites like Redfin, and more. I haven't been able to go hands-on with it yet, so I can't speak to how well it'll perform any of these tasks, although it did look snappy in the controlled demo.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDo you really trust an AI to browse for you?My concern with Auto Browse mostly lies in sketchy websites and permissions, although Google told me it's planned for those. Auto Browse needs to get permission before it can access your Google Password Manager, and if it stumbles across a link that the AI thinks doesn't look quite right, it will supposedly use Chrome's existing unsafe browsing protections to navigate away. A Google spokesperson told me its \"as secure as you can make it,\" although I'd probably want to keep an eye on it for at least my first few requests.The feature also has one limitation for now—while it can be open in multiple tabs at once, your Auto Browse tabs won't be able to communicate with one another. That means each instance of Auto Browse is isolated, but that could change in the future.Personally, I don't see myself using this much, especially for sensitive tasks like \"collecting tax documents,\" but automatically filling out a basic form does sound handy. Google said that Auto Browse will stop and ask for you to take over for sensitive steps in any tasks that might require it, like actually buying an item or submitting a form. It won't (or isn't supposed to) take that final step for you, giving you a chance to check its work. In that way, it's similar to the Gemini app's existing shopping features.Existing and upcoming featuresGemini in Chrome can use most of Gemini's existing features, allowing it to connect with apps like Gmail or access your history chatting with the bot. But there is one big one that's planned for the \"coming months.\"Recently, the Gemini app proper rolled out a beta for \"Personal Intelligence\" to paying users, allowing the AI to view all of your past conversations and connected apps without you having to direct it where to look. It's basically an extension of those existing connected apps and history features, with a reasoning model applied over it. For instance, you could tell it to help you find new tires for your car, and it would automatically know to look through your Gmail and Google Photos to find out what model of car you have and the last time you bought tires.That feature is still baking, but that it's even in the works means Google is moving fast on bringing parity between all the different ways you can access Gemini. Every other feature mentioned in this article is either already available, or rolling out now.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message. The healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text. Are you eligible for the Kaiser settlement? To qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to claim your settlement cashTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12. While the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If someone can steal your device, especially if they know how to break into it, they have access to a huge amount of your sensitive data. As such, good security features can mean the difference between losing that data, or protecting it entirely—even if your phone is long gone. Google has a number of anti-theft features baked in Android, appropriately called \"Theft Protection Features.\" While the company isn't announcing a slate of new features today, it did announced new updates to its existing Android Theft Protection features in a post on the company's Security Blog Tuesday. Here's what's new:First, the company announced updates to authentication safeguards, which apply to all Android devices running Android 16 or newer. That includes a new dedicated toggle in settings for Failed Authentication Lock, which automatically locks your screen after someone tries to guess your password too many times. Now, you can choose whether or not to keep this feature on right from settings. Google is also increasing the amount of time your phone locks up after too many failed passcode attempts, which reduces the chance for someone to break into your phone. I wouldn't have thought of this, but Google notes that it has included protections against children that try to break into your phone, by not counting identical passcode attempts against this retry limit. And while it isn't new, Google highlighted that since late 2025, all features and apps that use Android Biometric Prompt now work with Identity Check, which prevents unauthorized users from changing sensitive settings without a successful biometric authentication—meaning a face or fingerprint scan. \nThe company also announced enhancements to features that are available to devices running at least Android 10. First is an update to Remote Lock, which lets you lock up your phone from a web browser if it is stolen or goes missing. Now, you can set up a security question as part of the unlocking procedure. Even if someone knows your credentials, they'd need to know the answer to your security challenge before they could unlock your device. Tip: If you make the answer something nonsensical, you'll be even more protected (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name? h7r_t*2#). Just be sure to file that answer somewhere safe, like a password manager.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUsers in Brazil also have two new security settings enabled by default. The first is Theft Detection Lock, which can detect when your device has been snatched out of your hand in a likely theft situation. The second is Remote Lock, so users in Brazil can take advantage of the above benefits without having to set anything up first—other than the option security challenge question, of course. These updates might not be revolutionary, but they should help boost your Android's security a bit—and prevent your kids from locking you out of your phone for the day.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

These are sports earbuds first, and that focus shows in the design and the trade-offs. Right now, they’re $59.95 on Amazon, down from $89.95, which makes them easier to consider if you want something tough without paying premium prices. \nThe earbuds themselves are large and stick out more than most, but the silicone wing design works. You twist them into place, and they lock in. During runs, strength training, and high-sweat workouts, they stay put in a way many smaller earbuds do not. If fit security has been your frustration with workout earbuds, this alone may be enough to justify a look.The earbuds carry an IP68 rating, which means they’re dustproof and can handle heavy sweat and rain without concern. They are not designed for swimming, but they are tougher than almost anything else near this price. The charging case is less impressive. It’s light at about 1.4 ounces but bulky, and the IPX2 rating means it’s fine inside a gym bag but not something you want exposed to bad weather. Battery life, however, is a strong point. You get up to 12 hours with noise cancelling off, around 10 hours with it on, and up to 48 hours total with the case. That’s enough for a full week of workouts without needing to think about charging.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThese aren’t high-end earbuds, and it shows in the lack of crispness in higher frequencies. Bass is solid and punchy enough for workout playlists, but detail takes a backseat. As for its ANC, it works fine indoors, like in a gym or while commuting, but it reportedly doesn’t hold up well outside, where traffic and footfalls still break through. Ambient mode also falls short. It doesn’t let in enough sound for confidence near busy roads, and wind noise can become distracting. Controls are touch-based and can be customized in the app, but they don’t always respond well to sweaty fingers or gloves. These earbuds are not for people chasing refined sound or top-tier noise cancelling. They are for people who want a secure fit, long battery life, and gear that can take a beating.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And if you ask me, the Sonos Beam Gen 2 is one of the best deals of the bunch: This space-saving soundbar doesn't skimp on premium features, and it's currently down to $369 (originally $499), a near-record low according to price-tracking tools. This is the soundbar I'd choose if I were looking for a powerful option that wouldn't take up a ton of space in my living room.\nThis isn't the first Beam soundbar—that would be the Sonos Beam Gen 1, which came out in 2018. That was the first smart soundbar to support both Google and Alexa voice assistants, as well as AirPlay. The Sonos Beam Gen 2 arrived in 2021, adding Atmos compatibility, eARC connectivity, NFC connectivity, and a better processor. The Sonos companion app also improved dramatically, making for a much better experience, adding features like Sonos TruePlay, which calibrates the speaker based on its environment.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe release of the bigger and more powerful Sonos Arc Ultra last year kicked the Beam Gen 2 off the top of Sonos' product list, but that just means you've got a better chance of scoring a good discount on a still excellent device. Its flat, tablet-like design (measuring 2.7 x 25.7 x 4.0 inches) makes it extremely compact, yet it still produces big sound (with Dolby Atmos audio support), as noted in PCMag's \"excellent\" review. If you want deep bass you'll need to add a Sonos subwoofer, but otherwise, this is a great replacement for your TV's built-in speakers.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

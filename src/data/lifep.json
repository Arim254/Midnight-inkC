Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.This week, neurotech startup Neurable launched its MW75 Neuro headphones with a pretty seductive pitch—one that I'm not quite buying.Just slip on this pair of headphones, and you’ll gain unprecedented access to your brain's inner workings. Track your focus. Measure your mental fatigue. Quantify your cognitive performance. It's supposed to be the quantified-self movement's next frontier—moving from steps and heart rates to the most intimate data source of all: your brainwaves.\nIf you ask me, a pair of headphones that can read your mind sounds either too good to be true, or too creepy to be good. Neurable doesn’t plan to stop at headphones, and they aren’t the only company making a name in the space. Glasses, helmets, what have you—the next wave of wearable devices are targeting the brain. Whether you find it tempting or find it terrifying, the real question: Is this technology even real? Can \"brain tracking\" headphones actually measure anything meaningful, or are people paying $499 for an elaborate placebo wrapped in EEG sensors? Unsurprisingly, the answers are a little wrinkly. What are brain wearables in theory?The concept behind brain wearables is this: Using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors embedded in headphone ear cups, devices like Neurable's MW75 Neuro claim to track electrical signals from your brain, translating them into actionable insights about your mental state. The headphones promise to tell you when you're losing focus, when you need a break, and even provide a \"cognitive snapshot\" of your brain health over time.For the wellness-obsessed, it's pretty much catnip. Where fitness trackers gave us visibility into our physical states, brain wearables promise to illuminate the black box of our mental performance. In theory, you could optimize not just your workout routine, but your work-work routine, catching burnout before it catches you.The problem, according to experts across technology law and neuroscience, is that we're nowhere near ready for this technology to become mainstream—neither from a regulatory standpoint nor a scientific one. Let's start with the science.How does the science of brain wearables hold up?Before getting into the fairly obvious privacy nightmare, there's a fundamental question about whether these devices can actually deliver on their promises.José M. Muñoz, an associate at The Centre for Neurotechnology and Law in the United Kingdom and the International Center for Neuroscience and Ethics in Spain, is blunt in his assessment: \"For years, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, and challenges of direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies such as this new device from Neurable,\" he explains. \"Although it is true that the algorithms analyzing brain data collected via EEG are steadily improving, this remains a neurotechnology that is still insufficiently accurate outside of a medical or clinical setting.\"The problems are both technical and practical. EEG data quality is extremely sensitive to electrode placement—sometimes within a range of millimeters. When users place these sensors themselves, without medical supervision, their reliability plummets. Moreover, the most accurate EEG studies use far more electrodes than the handful embedded in a pair of headphones.\"In sum, you may be wearing these headphones and believing they are helping to improve your mental health, physical performance, or attention,\" Muñoz says. \"But what you are really improving are the manufacturer's algorithms, while handing over your brain data in exchange for very little.\"In other words, it's the tech tale old as time: You're not the customer being served by this technology. You're the data source training it.Dr. Annu Navani offers a more measured perspective. She acknowledges that brain wearables have \"significant limitations, including being currently expensive, less clinically validated, and less convenient or comfortable than wrist-worn trackers.\" The metrics they provide are also harder to translate into practical guidance—most people intuitively understand what to do with their step count, but what action should you take when your \"cognitive load score\" hits 73?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRather than replacing traditional fitness trackers, Navani believes brain wearables will likely \"complement rather than replace conventional devices, targeting a niche of users interested in cognitive and neuro-performance insights.\" Traditional wearables, she points out, still provide reliable, validated data for basic health metrics that users can easily understand and apply.Who is really reading your mind here?Think about it (and hey, maybe relish in the fact that no headphones are successfully reading those thoughts): Your brainwave data is arguably the most intimate biometric information you possess. We're talking about a window into your mental and emotional states. So what happens when you willingly give up this data with no meaningful oversight? \"I hope brain wearables are not the future of fitness tracking, or any industry, at least certainly not yet and not any time soon,\" says Star Kashman, a technology attorney and founding partner of a cyber law firm. \"We are still somehow facing a complete lack of federal regulation in the U.S. when it comes to biometric data, data privacy law, and minimal to no cybersecurity standards for these devices, and no protective regulations for users.\"The implications are stark: \"What happens when a 'brain wearable' is hacked?\" Kashman asks. The lack of regulation means users have little recourse and limited knowledge about how their neural data is being stored, used, or potentially sold.Regulation aside, individual consumers do still have their own privacy concerns. The sort of consumer ready to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones might just be the same type of person who is uncomfortable with constant surveillance. \"Unless someone is so obsessed with optimizing their fitness journey that they ignore the serious risks present, I just do not see this becoming the norm anytime soon,\" Kashman notes. Just look at Meta's push for smart glasses. The tech has got to be good and ready before consumers are going to drop hundreds of dollars and risk their most private bodily information. The bottom lineSo, simply put, at the time of this publication, asked with my own private brain waves: Are brain wearables the future of fitness tracking? Almost certainly not in the way their manufacturers hope. The technology is too immature, the regulatory landscape too barren, and consumer wariness too high for these devices to start popping up like Fitbits tomorrow. I'd say what we're witnessing instead is the familiar pattern of the wellness industry: a genuine technological development (EEG monitoring does work in controlled settings!) being prematurely commercialized and marketed with promises that totally outstrip the reality. The result is an expensive product that may provide some users with interesting data, but likely offers more placebo than breakthrough.For now, brain wearables occupy an awkward position: too invasive for casual users, too unproven for serious applications, and too unregulated to trust. They may have a future, but it's not this one—not until the science catches up to the marketing, and the law catches up to both.Until then, your regular fitness tracker measuring your heart rate and steps? That's probably telling you more useful information about your health than any headphones reading your brainwaves ever could.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Pop in, get the shot, then go about my day. That process has now gotten even easier: Last year, the FDA approved the first flu vaccine that you can administer yourself, or that parents can administer to their children, and it's now available for at-home ordering. I just placed my order. And best of all: It’s a nasal spray, so no needles.How can you get the at-home flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine, called FluMist, still needs to be prescribed by a medical provider. But since nearly everyone aged two through 49 is eligible, FluMist’s maker (AstraZeneca) has a telehealth website that bundles the provider's approval with an order to an online pharmacy. The process takes about five minutes on average, they say, and I found that to be accurate. I've already had my flu shot this year, but my kids haven't gotten it yet. (I also know my daughter strongly prefers the nasal to the injection when possible.) The website allowed me to add multiple people to the same order, so I filled out the questionnaire for each child, giving their names, ages, allergies, and so on. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe website then reached into some big data cloud out there and told me it already knew their insurance information (existentially frightening, yet convenient!) and presented me with my bill: an $8.99 fee, which included $2.50 for physician evaluation and $6.49 for shipping and processing. Insurance covers the cost of the vaccine itself. Who can use the at-home flu vaccine? The at-home vaccine is the same as regular FluMist, which is approved for ages two through 49. That means babies and older adults will still need to visit a provider for the regular, injectable flu vaccine. Children can get flu shots starting at the age of six months.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFluMist uses a live, weakened virus. It can't give you the actual flu, but it can cause some respiratory symptoms in people with weakened immune systems. So it's not recommended for people who are pregnant, have certain medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have close contact with an immunocompromised person. If that's you, talk to a provider about your best options. You may be advised to get the regular injectable type, which doesn't include any live virus. How do you give yourself the at-home flu vaccine? Mine hasn't arrived yet, but the instructions say that a package containing the vaccine will arrive at my door on the day I selected. It will be packed in an insulated container with cold packs, and should be put in the refrigerator upon arrival. There's also a tag I can scan to make sure the vaccine stayed at the proper temperature during the shipping process. Assuming that all goes well, you follow the instructions to spray the vaccine up your nose. (If you've gotten a FluMist at a pharmacy, it's the same idea.) Adults can administer it to themselves, and children will need an adult to do it for them. Instructions are, of course, provided. After you administer the vaccine, there is a prepaid envelope you can use to return the sprayers for disposal.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.It's official: As of Tuesday, Oct. 14, Microsoft no longer supports Windows 10. That said, if you powered on your Windows 10 PC this morning, only to read headlines suggesting the end of Windows 10, you might be a bit confused. Your computer still works, after all. So what's really going on here?What Windows 10 end of life really meansAs it might now be evident, Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 doesn't mean the company has shut down the OS for good. Any devices still running Windows 10 will continue to run—and, in fact, much in the same way as they previously have. You probably won't notice any difference between Windows 10 on Oct. 14 vs. Oct. 13.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe issue isn't that Windows 10 won't work going forward; rather, it's that Microsoft will no longer issue security updates to Windows 10 users by default. That means the next time someone discovers a security vulnerability with this OS—no matter how big or small it may be—Microsoft will not send a patch to most Windows 10 users. The risk of using Windows 10 going forward starts small, and escalates quickly. It's only day one of Windows 10's end of life, which means there's little risk in using the OS today. However, over time, more and more security vulnerabilities will surface. Soon enough, there will be a real danger in using a Windows 10 PC that is connected to the internet. All it takes is clicking one malicious link in a spam email, or downloading malware disguised as legitimate software, for hackers to strike. Windows 10 extended security updatesHere's the thing, though: Between users who can't or don't want to update to Windows 11, as well as organizations that rely on Windows 10 to run specific programs and services, there are still a lot of Windows 10 machines out there. If you're running Windows 10, you aren't alone—some estimates put the OS' market share at 40.5% of all Windows machines. Sure, there are more PCs out there running Windows 11, but there could be roughly half a billion users that just lost official support from Microsoft. Microsoft knows this, which is why this \"end of life\" isn't really the end for Windows 10. The company offers Windows 10 users the option of enrolling in Extended Security Updates, or ESU. Under the ESU program, you'll still receive critical security patches, even when using Windows 10. It does feel like Microsoft is soft launching Windows 10's demise, but at least all Windows 10 users have an option to continue using the OS securely. However, you can't just expect Microsoft to automatically enroll your PC in the ESU program. You have one of three options here, two of which are free:Pay a one-time $30 fee.Opt into Windows Backup to sync your PC to the cloud.Redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.You'll find these options your PC after updating to the latest possible version. From here, head to Settings > Windows Update, and look out for the \"Windows 10 support ends in October 2025\" and \"Enroll in Extended Security Updates to help keep your device secure\" options.Be warned, however, that Microsoft does not see this as a long-term solution. This is still part of the Windows 10 end of life plan, after all. The ESU program only lasts from Oct. 15 of this year through Oct. 13, 2026. After that date, Microsoft will stop issuing Windows 10 security updates for good. In addition, you will only receive security patches: no features, design changes, or tech support.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUpdating to Windows 11Whether it's today or Oct. 13 of next year, it won't be safe to run Windows 10 on an internet-connected PC without these security patches. As such, your only option for using Windows in the future is by upgrading to an OS Microsoft actively supports. At this time, that means Windows 11. That doesn't necessarily mean buying a new PC though, as Windows 11 might be compatible with your current machine. Here's are the minimum hardware requirements, as noted by Microsoft:Processor: 1 GHz or faster with at least two cores on a 64-bit chipMemory: 4GB or moreStorage: 64GB or moreGraphics card: Compatible with DirectX 12 or later, with a WDDM 2.0 driverTPM: Trusted Platform Module version 2.0 Display: 720p or higher, nine inches or larger, with 8 bits per color channelYour Windows 10 PC must also be running Windows 10 version 2004 or later, and you'll need to at least be running the Sept. 14, 2021 security update.While many of these requirements seem pretty basic, the one that trips up many otherwise capable machines is TPM 2.0. This is a security standard that can help prevent modern cyberattacks on Windows, so it's great to have. However, if you have a PC older than 2016, it might not have TPM 2.0. Your computer might very well be capable of running Windows 11, but Microsoft won't endorse it if you don't have this security hardware in place. Even still, you can go around Microsoft to install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC. Just note Microsoft does not approve of this, and may even stop supporting your PC if you choose this route—defeating the purpose of upgrading from Windows 10 in the process.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.If you have a Premium Family plan through Spotify, there's good news: You can now set up managed accounts for your kids. Not only can you control what they listen to, their music choices won't reflect in or affect your listening history. Congratulations: You're getting your Wrapped back.    On Tuesday, Spotify announced it is rolling out managed accounts for Premium subscribers to seven new regions: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Premium Family subscribers in these countries can now create managed accounts for users younger than 13 that allow those users to listen on their own, in a controlled environment. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nManaged accounts are music-only, so younger listeners can't browse Spotify's other offerings, such as podcasts, or send or receive DMs. In addition, account managers can control a number of settings on these accounts, including whether the account can listen to explicit music, choose to block specific artists and songs, and decide to hide video—including short-form Canvas content.While Spotify has an existing service designed for children, Spotify Kids, it's much different, as it only contains music hand-picked for the service, and doesn't allow subscribers to control the account. Managed accounts allow subscribers to give a full Spotify experience to their kids, while having total control over what they can listen to. Personally, I think this is a fantastic feature. As someone who grew up in the early days of iTunes, I would have loved the ability to add whatever songs I wanted to my playlists—assuming my parents gave those songs the OK, of course. It's also great that kids can get recommendations for new music from Spotify. If they are obsessed with the latest trending song, perhaps Spotify can recommend similar tunes, both contemporary tracks as well as classics. It could be a great way to expand kids' music tastes.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify first tested managed accounts in 10 other countries: New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Columbia. It's now available as part of its Premium Family plan, which costs $19.99 per month.   How to create a managed accountIf you're using the Spotify mobile app, head to Settings and privacy > Account > Premium Family. If you're on your account page on Spotify's website, choose \"Manage members.\" Either way, under Plan members, choose to add members to your plan. Choose \"Add a listener aged under 13,\" then choose \"Add account.\"You'll then follow the on-screen steps to confirm you are the parent or guardian of the listener; set a PIN to control the experience; choose the name and birthdate of the listener; and choose your settings. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

And it doesn't take much to find it.\n    \n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        October 14, 2025\n    \n            Credit: Dmytro Sheremeta/Shutterstock \n                            \n    \n            \n            \n        \n            The internet is full is misinformation, conspiracies, and lies. Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.\n        \n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.While sometimes there's a big piece of misinformation that a lot of people latch onto—like The Rapture or the existence of \"MedBeds\"—the fractured nature of the information sphere has all but killed the overarching conspiracy theory. No longer do big ideas like \"we never went to the moon\" unite the dumbest minds; instead, the algorithm creates bespoke conspiracy theories. So instead of joining the Flat Earth Society, you might think the actual year is 1728, or that AI secretly imagined a British comedian from the the 1980s and seeded the web with evidence of his existence.But how does it start? And how quickly can social media platforms transform someone from a person from a seeker-of-knowledge to a believer-in-bullshit? YouTuber Benaminute recently posted a video where he dug in to find out. His question: If you start with a benign, broad, randomly chosen subject, and you only watch videos having to do with that subject, how long will it take until TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels feed you a conspiracy theory video? The answer: not long at all. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDifferent topics all lead to the same place (more or less) For the experiment, Benaminute created \"blank\" social media profiles and behaved like someone who was innocently curious about one of three topics—dinosaurs, The Vietnam War, and the 2000 presidential election. He put the keyword in each platform's search bar and only watched and liked videos about the initial subject. DinosaursYouTube Shorts: The initial videos were ads for Jurassic Park, AI slop featuring dinosaurs, and the occasional educational video, but the 541st video was a clip from the Joe Rogan Experience about how the pyramids were not tombs, but \"DNA restoration devices.\"TikTok: If you thought TikTok would get to conspiracy theories quickly, you'd be right. The 144th video was this fake UFO video that has 24 million views. Instagram Reels: Insta took 661 videos to get from dinosaurs to a \"forbidden phone from the 2000s that lets you see into a parallel dimension.\"The Vietnam WarThings get worse for people interested in historical or political events. On all short-form platforms, an interest in Vietnam will lead you pretty quickly to right-leaning content, which leads you to conspiracy theories. YouTube Shorts got to a conspiracy theory video about Noah's Ark in only seven videos. TikTok took a little longer; video 161 was about how financial services company Blackrock had something to do with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Reels took 139 videos to get to \"Bush did 9/11.\" The 2000 electionThe election of 2000 is still a charged topic, but it's been awhile, so maybe cooler heads and verified information will win the day? Spoiler: nope. YouTube Shorts took 136 videos to get to the same Noah's Ark conspiracy as it did for dinosaur fans.TikTok only took 38 videos to get to \"The Rapture is happening on September 24.\"Reels took only 26 videos to land on \"The World Trade Center was bombed\" (by either Clinton or Bush). Which social media app leads to conspiracy theories fastest?The champion of \"normal search to conspiracy theory\" speed runs is TikTok, with an average of 114 videos or 57 minutes of watching. YouTube Shorts comes in second with 230 videos or 1 hour 57 minutes of time, and Reels takes 275 video or 138 minutes. It's a distinction without a difference; however, all three platforms lead to conspiracies in the time it takes to watch a Marvel movie. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does it all mean? It would be easy to conclude that the massive tech companies that built YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok companies weight their recommendation engines so viewers are led to fake stories. Maybe they have specific political aims and are trying to sway votes, or maybe (as Benaminute posits in a semi-tongue-in-cheek way) these apps are built to \"keep us angry, divided, and distracted\" from realizing the conflict isn't between Left and Right, but between \"up and down.\" This is also a conspiracy theory, however. I'm not saying he's wrong, but we don't have enough information to know why algorithms recommend conspiracy content. It could be because bad actors at the top demand specific results for some purpose, but it seems more likely to me that TikTok et al. don't have an agenda beyond making money.\\I have no doubt that a social media platform featuring an algorithm that weighs the truth heavily would fail pretty quickly; the Truth is boring compared to conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories, broadly, make believers feel special, like they have inside knowledge the rest of us lack. People scroll TikTok to have fun; the truth usually isn't fun.  Conspiracy theorist can say things like \"UFOs are here!\" or \"They're turning the frogs gay!\" Meanwhile, if you're devoted to the truth, you mostly have to go with \"the best evidence suggests...\" or \"it seems logical that...\" and who wants to hear that?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

It warned a \"limited number of users\" who had communications with certain Discord teams were affected, though the \"unauthorized party\" did not gain access to any Discord networks directly. In that initial announcement, Discord said a number of user data types might have been stolen. That included their names, usernames, email addresses, billing information, last four digits of credit cards, purchase histories, IP addresses, messages with Discord service agents, and \"limited corporate data,\" such as training materials and internal presentations. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhile all of this information is sensitive, it unfortunately isn't surprising to see as part of a breach like this. However, Discord also revealed that the hackers may have also gained access to a \"small number\" of government ID images, including driver's licenses and passports. As it turns out, that \"small number\" turned out to be 70,000. Discord confirmed as much to The Verge on Wednesday. If you were among these affected users, Discord will have reached out to you via email.Age verification is a privacy nightmareWhy did a Discord affiliate even have these users' government IDs to begin with? Age verification. Like many other companies, Discord now restricts certain content to minors. If you are incorrectly identified as underage, you're allowed to appeal and prove that you are at least 18 years old. To do so, you need to take a photo of yourself holding either a photo ID with your date of birth, or a piece of paper with your full Discord username. Discord outsources this work to a third-party, which hackers targeted in this data breach.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs 404 Media reports, hackers suggest they've taken even more data than Discord has acknowledged. That includes data on whether users were verified or not; users' home towns, states or counties, and countries; info on whether they had multi-factor authentication turned on for their account; and the last time they were online on Discord.This event demonstrates the risks of companies requiring users to verify their ages by uploading government IDs. Users in Texas must verify their ages before they can download apps on their phones, while a number of states require the same before accessing adult websites. No matter where you live, YouTube will use AI to guess your age, and, if it gets it wrong, you'll need to prove your age yourself. The goal is to protect children and underage users from accessing content they shouldn't be seeing, but by doing it this way, companies are putting users at risk: They're asking you to trust them with your government IDs, credit cards, even selfies; or, if not them, a third-party affiliate. As we can see with this case, a lapse in security means tens of thousands of Discord users who were just trying to prove their age now have exposed government IDs. What happens when an entire state's population faces the same? Or a whole country's?  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Discovery\n                            \n            \n                Key Takeaways\n                                            HBO Max is raising its prices for all three subscription tiers.\n                                            Basic With Ads is $1 more per month, Standard is $1.50 more per month, and Premium is $2 more per month.\n                                            Annual plans are also increasing in prices, though customers will only see those increases when their subscriptions are up for renewal.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        It's now more expensive than ever to stream shows like House of the Dragon and Hacks. On Tuesday, Oct. 21, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that all HBO Max subscription prices will increase, effective immediately. In fact, for some plans, it is now more expensive to subscribe to HBO Max than it is to subscribe to Netflix.Here's the deal: Prices are going up across all three of HBO Max's subscription tiers. That includes the following: HBO Max Basic With Ads: $10.99 per month (was $9.99 per month), or $109.99 per year (was $99.99 per year)HBO Max Standard: $18.49 per month (was $16.99 per month), or $184.99 per year (was $169.99 per year)HBO Max Premium: $22.99 per month (was $20.99 per month), or $229.99 per year (was $209.99 per year)These price points are now in effect for all new subscribers. Current monthly subscribers will be notified of the price hike, and will see increases on their next billing cycle, on or after Nov. 20, 2025. Similarly, annual subscribers will not see a price increase until their plans are up for renewal. If you signed up for an annual Premium subscription yesterday, for example, you're locked into that $209.99 price until next year. If your annual Premium plan renews next month, however, you'll be charged that extra $20. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis is, of course, the most expensive HBO Max has ever cost, and will be especially felt by any subscribers that pay for extra member accounts. In fact, HBO Max Basic With Ads and HBO Max Standard now costs more than Netflix with Ads and Netflix Standard, by quite a bit. Netflix with Ads is only $7.99 at this time, while Netflix Standard is $17.99. It costs $.50 more to subscribe to HBO Max Standard than Netflix Standard, and $3 more to subscribe to deal with HBO's ads over Netflix's. The only edge HBO Max still has is in the Premium category, as Netflix charges $24.99 for the privilege of 4K content with four concurrent streams at once. If you're looking at these price points, and are committed to only one streaming service at a time, you might be convinced to take the Netflix route. As such, Warner Bros. Discovery might be banking on the demand for its content over the dollar and cents here: Between series like The Last of Us, The Gilded Age, The Penguin, and The White Lotus, and content like Weapons and Peacemaker, HBO Max is host to some of the most talked-about shows. Maybe that will convince people to stick with the service even through these price hikes, especially as the Game of Thrones spinoff A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is on the horizon.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Amazon Web Services experienced intermittent issues, throwing a huge fraction of the internet into chaos, as the sites and services built on it faltered or stopped working altogether. It was a sobering reminder that a lot of the world relies on AWS for networking, computing, and data storage. Truth be told, I was surprised to learn just how owned we really are, especially after a number of my work apps experienced issues. In fact, over four million business with a physical address use AWS for cloud-computing needs. It is the largest cloud infrastructure servicer in the world, with a whopping 30% of the market share. That's why when a global outage like this occurs, it's impossible to ignore: So many companies and products are affected, from streaming platforms like Prime Video, to social media sites like Facebook, that almost everyone who goes online will experience the disruption.But 30% is not 100%. AWS might be the market leader, but it is not the entire market. There are plenty of other cloud infrastructure companies out there offering similar services—and posing similar risks should they experience outages. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy use a cloud infrastructure company?It's not necessarily a bad thing for companies turn to an AWS for their computing needs. It's simply much more cost efficient to outsource the resources necessary for running programs, storing data, and hosting traffic, especially as businesses rapidly grow and change. Rather than spend the time and money constantly purchasing and upgrading on-site hardware, companies can pay for servers as they go. Companies like AWS will scale up or down as needed, without interruption to service—until, of course, there is an interruption to services.These companies can offer a host of cloud-based services and tools, including compute, databases, machine learning, networking, security, and storage. AWS just so happens to be the biggest of the bunch, but plenty of companies choose other cloud infrastructure options for their needs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAWS alternativesThere are many other companies offering the same services as AWS, but for our purposes, I'm going to list seven of the most popular, starting with AWS' main competitors: Microsoft Azure: Microsoft's cloud computing services is only second to AWS in terms of global market share. Microsoft obviously uses its own cloud infrastructure, but plenty of other companies do too, including Ralph Laruen, Best Buy, Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola, Abercrombie & Fitch, and even local, state, and federal governments.Google Cloud: Google Cloud is the third largest player in this space, with companies like Lowe's, Wendy's, EA, Fox Sports, Bayer, and McLaren all using its services. Alibaba Cloud: Alibaba Cloud has a large cloud computing market share, and is used by companies like Air Asia, Zara, Lenovo Group, and JNE Express. Oracle Cloud: Oracle Cloud includes customers like Quest Diagnostics, Baylor University, Smeg, Northwell Health, DHL, and MEO.Salesforce: Companies like Pacers Sports, Indeed, F1, and The Adecco Group use Salesforce's data cloud services.   IBM Cloud: Deloitte, Pfizer, Harvard, Vodafone, and even the US Open purchase cloud products from IBM Cloud.Tencent Cloud: You might know Tencent particularly from its massive games division, but its cloud services are also wide reaching. They include services for companies like L'Oréal Paris, Tim Hortons, and Dell, as well as its own subsidiaries like Supercell and DouYu. If there's a silver lining here, it's that there are more than just two or three companies powering sites and services around the globe, and we're not quite at the point where every company connected to the internet relies on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. That level of centralization would pose even larger risks than the ones we're currently living with.Still, present circumstance are, still pretty risky. AWS has 30% of the market share, Azure has 20%, and Google Cloud has 12%. Taken together, these three companies make up 62% of all cloud infrastructure companies around the globe. Yes, it's good the other 38% is spread out amongst a collection of other players, but the risk of another AWS-like outage is high. Hopefully, following Monday's debacle, there is work currently being done to prevent such a thing from happening again, but that's being optimistic.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Users have spent that time generating hyper-realistic vertical videos that, despite their watermarks, might already be fooling people on the internet. I, for one, see nothing good about a tool that can make these types of videos from simple prompts, perhaps outside the sheer novelty alone. But the app is undeniably popular, and, as expected, OpenAI is continuing to \"improve\" it. On Wednesday, the head of Sora, Bill Peebles, shared a roadmap of updates coming to the app, from cameos for your pets to video editing tools. Sora will soon let you make cameos of anything you wantPeebles says that \"character cameos\" are on their way in the coming days. When this feature drops, you'll be able to make cameos of just about anything you want, including your pets (Peebles suggests your dog or guinea pig), stuffed toys, as well as AI-generated characters Sora may have produced in your past videos.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nCameos are a defining, and controversial, Sora feature. It lets you scan your likeness into the app so you can create videos featuring yourself. Not only that, you can remix videos with cameos of anyone else who has scanned themself into Sora—assuming their permissions allow you to use their cameos. It's impressive tech, but it raises major ethical concerns, considering you can make someone else do or say things they never signed off on. Now, apparently, you'll also be able to do the same with the family cat or your childhood stuffed animal. Following these additional cameo options, Peebles says you'll be able to see \"the latest trending cameos in real time.\" I'm guessing the idea is to browse the most popular cameos on the platform, and, if you want to, add them to your own videos. Sora is also getting basic video editing tools. According to Peebles, this starts with the ability to stitch multiple clips together, though other \"powerful new features\" will follow. Peebles says the Sora team is also working on reducing \"excessive moderation,\" which he acknowledges is \"super annoying\" to users, as well as improving the app's performance.Speaking of apps, Android users will soon have their chance to try Sora. Right now, the app is iOS-only, but Sora's Android version is \"actually coming soon,\" Peebles says.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA reminder to be wary of what you see on the internetAs critical and cynical as I am about Sora and services like it, I can see the utility here. I imagine people will get a kick out of being able to put their pets in any situation they want. And if they want to make fried eggs sing a song, or a stuffed animal say \"hello,\" more power to them. But my main concerns with this app are not assuaged by any of these updates: Sora still lets you generate convincing videos with a simple prompt, with the only safeguard a watermark that's easy to remove if you know where to look. People were already falling for fake videos on the internet before these tools came along; now, it's becoming way too difficult to know whether what you're watching is actually real or not. If you ask me, you're better off assuming all of it is fake.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the past 24 hours, multiple users on Reddit have complained about being unable to call 911, while the Bell carrier in Canada issued a warning that the Pixel 6 and up was also having problems contacting emergency services on its network.According to user Fabulous_Disaster730, who posted yesterday about difficulties contacting emergency services during a gas leak, her Pixel 9 Pro repeatedly prompted her to turn on wifi calling or turn off airplane mode before she could call 911, despite her having full signal on both 5G and wifi. The phone would then freeze and restart. After multiple attempts, she resorted to asking a friend to place the call for her instead.Multiple replies mentioned facing similar problems yesterday as well, across multiple networks and models of Pixel. Bell, however, was the only carrier to issue an official notice.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAside from the obvious danger, the problem with this bug is that it's not consistent. Despite seemingly having had a surge yesterday, it's been a known issue as far back as 2021. However, it doesn't affect all users, nor is it entirely predictable when or how it will pop up. While recent reports are of calls simply not going through, one user posted two months ago that their call did go through, but they only heard screeching and static on the other end of the line. These recent reports are only the latest in an ever-evolving concern.It's also not clear what's causing the problem. In 2021, the problem was attributed to Microsoft Teams, but even with that error patched up, users are still facing problems. To Google's credit, Bell said it reached out to the company shortly after it learned about yesterday's uptick in cases, and afterwards said that a fix had been issued. However, no other carriers have issued similar notices, and I wouldn't be surprised to see other users making their own complaints in the future.It's worth noting that Bell mentioned that Pixel 6 users and up were the ones affected this time around, and that the Pixel 6 also happened to release in 2021, which is when the bug first started making news. Whatever is at the core of the problem here, I wouldn't be surprised if it worked its way in on the Pixel 6 and just hasn't yet been addressed.However, given the severity of the issue, it's something that needs looking at sooner rather than later. I've reached out to Google for comment on this issue, and will update if I hear back. In the meantime, it's best to be prepared in case the worst happens. If you're on a Pixel phone, here's what you can do to contact 911 in an emergency:First, try to place a 911 callIf you have time and the danger is not immediate, it's worth trying to call 911 on your Pixel despite the issues. While users reporting problems have increased as of late, it's still not an everyone or every time problem. It's possible your call will still go through without issue.You can also text 911If, however, you are unable to call 911, it's worth remembering that in certain jurisdictions (check this regularly updated list to see if where you live is supported), you can also contact 911 via text. This is a slower method of reaching out for help, but is still better than nothing. To text 911, open your texting app, put in 911 as the recipient, and write a concise message with your issue, your location, and any necessary specifics, like cross streets, landmarks, a specific hiding location, or whether you're able to talk.Use a backup phoneWhile I don't expect someone who isn't constantly reviewing tech to have multiple phones on hand, the surest method to ensure you'll be able to call 911 if you're on a Pixel is to keep a backup phone that isn't a Pixel handy. This could be a landline or another cell phone. Crucially, it can be an old cell phone, even one that isn't actively attached to a phone plan. So long as your phone is able to connect to a network, it's legally required to be able to call 911, so if you have an old phone you've upgraded from and haven't traded in laying around, it may be smart to keep it charged up in case you need it in an emergency.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The guidelines from public health organizations tell you to aim for at least 150 minutes of “moderate” exercise each week, and that each minute of “vigorous” exercise counts double. That raises the question: What the hell is “moderate” exercise? How do you know when you’re doing it? Scientists measure METs, but you don't have to If you have any kind of smartwatch or fitness tracker, it may try to tell you that \"moderate\" exercise occurs at a certain heart rate. This isn't actually the case. The scientists who came up with the exercise guidelines didn't use heart rate as their guide. Instead, they used charts that measured how many \"METs,\" or metabolic equivalents, each type of exercise requires. I'll explain more about METs below, but the important thing to know is that the type and intensity of exercise is what tells you whether it's moderate, not your heart rate while you're doing it. You can look up exercises on a chart like this one, but here's the basic idea: \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWalking is moderate, jogging or running is vigorous.Bicycling is moderate if it’s under about 12 miles per hour on the flat.Indoor cycling is moderate if it’s up to about 100 watts of power.All that said, you don’t have to overthink it. The guidelines that mention “moderate” and “vigorous” activities aren’t asking you to monitor your heart rate or any other numeric metric. They want you thinking in terms of generalities: walking versus running, leisurely bike commuting versus sweating your heart out in a spin studio.And honestly, if it’s easier to watch your heart rate than to worry about the above, that’s fine. For most of us, 150 minutes of Zone 2 is going to be at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise. So follow that guideline, and you’ll be an overachiever.It’s not really about heart rateSo why does your watch want to steer you toward a certain heart rate during exercise? Mostly because that's easy to measure. Moderate exercise sorta-kinda matches up to \"zone 2\" cardio, which I’ve previously explained. (Zone 2 is is the second-lowest intensity in a five-zone system, and the easiest way to know which zone you're in is to glance at your fitness watch.)While you can use heart rate zones as a rule of thumb to find moderate exercise, this idea falls short in two ways: (1) different gadgets and systems use different cutoffs to decide which numbers count as \"zone 2\", and (2) for most of us, zone 2 includes most moderate activities but also some vigorous activities. If you’re relatively fit, you can jog at a 12 minute-per-mile pace while keeping your heart rate in zone 2. That’s a “vigorous” activity in terms of METs, though. The other reason heart rate isn’t accurate for this task is that your heart rate changes for all kinds of reasons. The hotter it is when you're working out, the higher your heart rate tends to be. Same goes for when you’re nervous or stressed. And as you get fitter, you’ll be able to do the same activities at a lower heart rate. Those activities might feel easier than they used to, but they’re not any less work. What is a MET, anyway?One MET is the energy expended when you’re at rest—the amount of oxygen, calories, etc that it takes to keep you alive and breathing. (We use oxygen in the process of burning calories, so officially a MET is 3.2 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.) Researchers can then put a mask on a person and measure how much oxygen they use while running, walking, playing guitar, etc. If an activity takes twice as much oxygen as sitting still, they say it takes two METs. Here are a few examples (taken from this scientific paper): 2 MET: washing dishes, or playing croquet3 MET: walking at 3 miles per hour (a pretty typical walking pace)4 MET: table tennis, ice skating5 MET: modern dance, fast-paced ballroom dance6 MET: volleyball, singles tennis7 MET: jogging, jumping ropeThe numbers go up from there. Speed skating clocks in at 15 MET. To be clear, you will not be measuring METs directly when you exercise. The MET studies are done in labs so that we can use the information to get a sense of what MET values each common type of exercise tends to have.Moderate exercise is 3 to 6 MET, and vigorous is 6 or moreThe physical activity guidelines define “moderate” exercise as at least 3 MET, but less than 6. Vigorous is 6 MET or more. Because METs are specific to the activity, not to how fit you are, it makes the most sense to look at METs in terms of the pace you run or the settings you use on your treadmill or other cardio machine. Here are paces and activities that have been clocked as between 3 and 6 METs: Walking at 3-4 mph (a 15-minute to 20-minute mile)Cycling, between 50 to 100 wattsShooting basketsPlaying baseballTaking a low-impact aerobics classAnd these are vigorous (6 or more MET): Race walking (5+ mph) Walking uphillWalking with a 12-pound packJogging (a 12-minute mile is 8.0 MET; the faster you go, the higher the MET)Bicycling at 12 miles per hour or fasterSwimming lapsPlaying a game of basketball, soccer, or hockeySo when you're trying to get your 150 minutes (or more) of moderate exercise each week, you can count all your walking, your easy bike riding, and your low-impact aerobics class. Give yourself credit for vigorous exercise for all the time you spend jogging (at any heart rate), lap swimming, or rucking. You may find you've been doing more exercise than you think.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Starting today, new users in California will have to scan their faces while setting up their accounts to ensure that they're both real and that they match their profile photos. Called Face Check, the new mandatory feature is the first step in a new initiative from Tinder's parent company Match Group, which says the goal is to help reduce \"spam, scam attempts, or [bots] operating automated fake profiles.\" When signing up, users will need to complete a \"liveness check,\" during which they'll take a video selfie from various angles. After that, the app will compare the selfie to profile pictures also uploaded during setup, and if it determines that they match, the user will get a \"Photo Verified badge\" and they'll be able to finish making their account. Tinder also says the system can determine if a picture has been used across multiple accounts to help prevent impersonation.While Face Check is new to the United States, it's already been launched abroad in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and \"several countries across Southeast Asia.\" According to Tinder, \"when coupled with other recent safety initiatives,\" Face Check has led to an over 60% decrease in users exposed to \"bad actors,\" and an over 40% decrease in reports of bad actors.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nFace Check's debut also coincides with the rise of AI image generators, and while the company's announcement post doesn't explicitly call out AI, it's not hard to see how it could prove handy against bots using generated photos to pretend to be someone who doesn't even exist. Traditional catfishing methods, such as using stock photos, can be detected with diligent reverse image searching, but AI's ability to quickly create novel, believable, and specifically tailored results has made it harder than ever to know whether you're speaking to a genuine human online.At the same time, as other apps begin to collect personal information like government IDs, there is a privacy concern. Tinder says that Face Check only uses your video selfie to complete the verification process, and deletes it shortly after review, although it does generate a \"non-reversible, encrypted face map\" that is stored to \"help verify new photos, detect fraud, and prevent duplicate accounts.\"As someone who met my husband on Twitter (RIP), I'll leave it up to you whether that's worth it. Have you tried just getting real good at posting instead?For now, though, you might have to wait a bit until Face Check actually makes its way to you. First, Tinder is not forcing existing accounts to use Face Check, which is why I assume it's using a badge to indicate the accounts that have gone through Face Check, even though it's mandatory during setup. Second, Face Check is rolling out slowly. Tinder says that it will come to additional states \"in the coming months,\" although the company did not provide an exact timeline.As for other apps, Match Group (which also owns OKCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, among others) says it will extend Face Check to additional platforms in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

There's WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Signal, Telegram, and iMessage (if you're on iPhone), and that's just the dedicated chat apps. You might have to keep up with new messages on Instagram, TikTok, Threads, even Spotify. If I install one more app with a messaging feature, I'm going off the grid. As it happens, another non-chat app is joining this list. On Tuesday, Zillow—yes, Zillow—announced its app will also now support messaging. Starting today, you can send people messages in the app you use to look at houses you will most likely never actually buy. We live in interesting times, indeed. Of course, Zillow's goal here isn't to become the next WhatsApp. In fact, you can only choose to chat with one other person on Zillow—at least, that's the case for now. The idea of Zillow messaging is strictly to chat about listings you find through the app, without needing to leave Zillow to do so. The goal for most app developers is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, so there's a cynical case to make here for Zillow trapping its users within the app. If you don't move to another chat app to talk about a listing, you're more likely to interact with additional houses on the app. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut I actually see the logic here: If you're in a housing market with a lot of listings, you're probably firing off a number of them every day to interested parties—namely, whoever you're buying the house with. Keeping those conversations in the same app as those listings could be a smart way to keep track of all those houses, instead of the usual routine of \"wait, which house was that? I can't find the text you sent me.\" And the fact that Zillow is limiting this experience to one chat partner at this time means you're not going to be DMing a number of people about houses in your area. This does seem designed for people who are trying to buy a house together to do so with a bit more convenience.How to try Zillow messagingThis feature is live as of this article. To get started, open Zillow on your smartphone or in your web browser. On the app, tap \"Inbox;\" on the web, click your profile in the top-right, then choose \"Inbox.\"  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to start a chat, you need to invite the other person to join you. To do so, choose \"Invite now,\" which will pull up a pop-up about the feature. This screen explains the invite link is good for 24 hours, and that you can only invite one person for now. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nChoose \"Share invitation,\" and Zillow will let you share it wherever you'd like. You can copy the link, and paste it in another chat app, or choose a destination for Zillow to share the link to directly.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Until Nov. 11, referral codes from existing members get you more money off your hardware purchases. The discount detailsLast month, Peloton rolled out upgraded versions of its fleet, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread+, Tread+, and Row. The new devices are known as the Cross Training series and, as such, are named the Cross Training Bike, Crosstraining Tread+, etc. If you want to know how they differ from the old models, I wrote an explainer here, but the basic gist is that the proprietary touchscreens on which you follow guided classes now swivel around, making it easier to hop off your machine and do, say, a strength or yoga class. The Plus line also comes with a movement-tracking camera that uses AI to correct your form, suggest when it's time to add more weights or reps, and monitor your workouts. As you can assume, these are pricier than their predecessors, which is why the current referral promotion might be of interest to you. If you get a referral code from an existing All-Access Member, here's what you can get off at checkout: $300 (instead of the usual $250) off your cart when you purchase a new Peloton Cross Training Bike$700 off your cart (instead of $500) when you purchase a new Peloton Cross Training Bike+$500 off (instead of $300) when you get a Peloton Cross Training Tread$1,200 off (instead of $600) a purchase of a new Peloton Cross Training Tread+$200 off a new Peloton Cross Training Row+ All the discounts will return to normal after Nov. 11. (Note: This probably isn't the best time to get a Cross Training Row+, as the typical referral discount on that is $300.)Your referrer has to be an All Access Member, not someone who uses one of the less-expensive, app-only versions of Peloton's digital offerings. The referrer can't be renting their machine, their membership can't be paused, and they can't be a Peloton employee. Notice, too, that this specifically applies to new devices. That means you can't use the referral code to get money off a purchase on Peloton's resale platform, Repowered, although that's always a solid option if you're looking for equipment on a budget. You don't have to have the Cross Training series to get a good workout (although I enjoyed my demos of those devices); I have been using the same Peloton Bike for nearly five years and love it—I ride it every day. You can redeem your code on the Peloton website or at Peloton stores. Bear in mind, however, you have to be a new customer. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to find a referral codeIf you want to be the referrer, not the referee, here's how to generate the code that will get you some brownie points with your fitness-focused friends. The easiest way is to go to this link and log into your Peloton account. Otherwise, head to members.onepeloton.com and select the hamburger menu in the top right corner, then hit Refer friends. If you're not seeing that or the link above didn't work, you're not eligible to share a code. You can also do this on your mobile app by tapping the Community tab, then Add Friends on the upper right, then Refer Friends.Remember how I said you'll get brownie points with the people you refer? You get something else, too: You can give out up to $1,200 in referrals, but you also get a free month of your All Access Membership for every person you refer. Once someone makes a purchase with your code, you'll get en email containing a code of your own, plus instructions on how to redeem it, after three to five business days. The voucher codes are valid for three months after their issue date. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n            Staff writer\n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

I've been providing administrative help to my partner as he opens a new business, managing professional expansions of my own, studying for a certification exam, overseeing renovations to my apartment, and restructuring my finances while still keeping up with my regular jobs and responsibilities. For a while, I was waking up tired before the day even started despite the fact that most of these boil down to never-ending, tedious, but little tasks like \"send that email,\" \"return that phone call,\" \"confirm that account number,\" and \"pick a paint color.\" I'm convinced it's actually those smaller tasks that burn you out. If every day were one where I was taking a big swing and doing something that felt monumental, I wouldn't be procrastinating as much as I am. Well, as much as I was. I started falling back on my old friend, the \"two-minute rule,\" and the procrastination I was dealing with a few weeks ago came to a quick halt. I am certain you're busy and overwhelmed, too, so here's how this simple rule works and what it can do for you at times when you feel like you have so much to do that you can't functionally do any of it.What’s the two minute rule?The two minute rule came from David Allen, author of Getting Things Done. The idea is simple: If you can get something done in two minutes, just do it. Don’t think it over. Don’t ponder whether it’s more or less important than the heavier lifts you have to do. If it takes two minutes or less to get done, just do it right now.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDoing tasks when they’re still small potatoes stops them from snowballing into bigger projects—the kind that take longer than two minutes. For instance, it takes you less than two minutes to clean the dishes after a single meal. If you let them pile up every time you eat, it’ll take longer when you finally have to do it, and you’re more likely to procrastinate knowing that it’s going to be a time-suck.Getting a bunch of minor tasks knocked off your to-do list builds momentum: With several smaller responsibilities taken care of, you’re likely to feel more capable of diving into deeper work. This method is similar to the idea of “eating the frog” in that way, although there are notable differences. When you practice “eating the frog,” you knock out your biggest responsibility first; when you use the two-minute rule, you do the opposite. Which you choose depends on the type of work you have and your personal preference, but both result in a feeling of accomplishment that can propel you through the rest of your workload.How to use the two minute rule effectivelyUnlike eating the frog, the two minute rule isn’t specific about getting your task done right away when you wake up. Rather, it encourages you to do any simple task the moment it occurs to you. Think of the things that lead you to procrastinate in a regular day. For me, it’s responding to emails: I see emails come in but don’t reply right away, even though that would take me a few seconds. Eventually, I have to respond, but with the added weight of expressing remorse for my untimely reply on top of addressing whatever the original message was about. In worst-case scenarios, the event or need the original email was expressing has evolved, too, because I didn't take care of it right away. Then, I have to deal with a situation that is worse or more urgent than it was when the email first came in.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI've been two-minute ruling my emails consistently for the past few weeks, and it's helped me in a number of ways. First, I just feel better and like I have less of a weight on me if I reply, \"Thanks, I got this. I'll check it out and get back to you.\" Even just acknowledging the message is forward progress. Second, it's stopped people from having to send follow-ups or attempting to work on something without my approval or input, possibly doing it in a way I don't prefer or isn't helpful to my goals. This goes beyond emails, of course; that's just the example of the small tasks that bog down my life. For what it's worth, I think it's valuable to get a little abstract with the \"two-minute\" idea, but not too abstract. For instance, if your gas tank is on 25%, it will take longer than two minutes to pull off and fill it up, sure, but that's still a small, quick task that needs to get done. The other benefit here is you stop fretting over everything and wasting so much time. I had to select a wallpaper color the other day and I was dragging that out, exemplifying Parkinson's Law, which states, \"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\" I called on my two-minute rule, made a firm decision instead of continuing to deliberate, and got the wallpaper the next day. Now it's up and I can move on to other things.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Scroll through social media and you'll find countless influencers touting weighted vests as the secret to building unbreakable bones and sculpted muscles. Many videos have gained hundreds of thousands of views with claims that weighted vests will \"transform your body\"—a claim that, to be fair, is par for the course in any fitness trend. \"Weighted vest walks\" are popular enough to be parodied, and even if I find those videos a little mean-spirited, they do point to an important question: Does this trendy fitness accessory actually deliver on its promises?Let's dig into what science really says about weighted vests—and what they can (and can't) do for your body.The claim: Weighted vests can build bone density or stop bone lossI can see how this theory sounds legit. Bones respond to mechanical stress by becoming stronger—it's why astronauts lose bone density in zero gravity, and why weight-bearing exercise is recommended for osteoporosis prevention. So logically, strapping on extra weight should signal your bones to bulk up, right? Not exactly.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccording to Dr. Leah Verebes, a professor at the Touro School of Health Science's DPT program, the reality is more nuanced. \"Some research, particularly among elderly persons and postmenopausal women, suggests that the use of a weighted vest while exercising, or plain walking, can slow bone loss or improve bone density modestly—especially in the legs and hips,\" she says.However, the gains are far from dramatic. Verebes notes that \"results are variable and gains are minimal.\" Traditional resistance training like weightlifting and higher-impact activities like jogging or jumping produce significantly better results. A 2023 review found that while weighted vests may help maintain bone mineral density, the overall quality of evidence supporting this benefit remains low to moderate.Weighted vests can help maintain bone strength, particularly for people who can't tolerate high-impact exercise due to joint issues or other limitations. But they're not a substitute for proper resistance training or impact activities.The claim: Wearing a weighted vest builds muscle and increases strength.Here's where expectations need serious adjustment. Yes, adding weight to your body does increase the resistance during bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and step-ups. And yes, this can contribute to improvements in muscular endurance and modest strength gains. But there's a catch.\"Vest walking also increases caloric expenditure and activates muscles more than regular walking, but the weight is typically too low to induce significant muscle growth,\" Verebes says. Most weighted vests are designed to be 5-15% of your body weight—enough to make your workout harder, but not enough to trigger substantial muscle building.Think of it this way: If you weigh 150 pounds, a 10% weighted vest adds just 15 pounds. That's less resistance than you'd use for a basic strength training exercise. \"Significant muscle growth continues to require progressive resistance training with more substantial weights,\" Verebes says.So, weighted vests can intensify your workout and improve muscular endurance, but they won't replace a proper strength training program if your goal is building significant muscle mass.The risks nobody's posting aboutWhile social media showcases people effortlessly crushing workouts in weighted vests, the reality is that adding load to your body comes with real risks. Verebes says that \"too much excess weight can cause strain on joints, especially the knees, hips, and lower back.\" The increased load can also impair balance and increase fall risk, a particular concern for older adults who might be using vests specifically to improve bone health.Perhaps most concerning is the risk of overuse injuries when people add weight too quickly. \"Professionals recommend starting with a light vest—roughly 5–10% body weight—and adding to it gradually as strength and tolerance improve,\" Verebes says.What actually works for building strong bones and musclesIf you're serious about improving your musculoskeletal health, Verebes offers evidence-based recommendations:Prioritize resistance training. Weightlifting or using resistance bands remain the most effective methods for keeping bones and muscles strong. Progressive overload—gradually increasing the weight you lift—is key to continued improvement.Include impact and weight-bearing exercise. Walking, hiking, stair climbing, and jumping all provide bone stimulation. Activities that involve impact force your bones to adapt and strengthen.Support exercise with proper nutrition. You can't out-train a poor diet. Adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D are essential for maintaining bone and muscle health. Without proper nutrition, even the best exercise program will fall short.So, should you use a weighted vest?Look, weighted vests aren't worthless. They can add challenge to bodyweight exercises and walking routines, providing modest improvements in muscle endurance and bone maintenance, particularly for older adults or those unable to do high-impact activities.But as Verebes says, \"they are not a shortcut to get to stronger bones and bigger muscles overnight. For significant improvements, regular resistance training and impact exercise remain the gold standard.\"The bottom line? Weighted vests are a tool, not a miracle solution. If you do decide to try a weighted vest, start conservatively with 5-10% of your body weight, add load gradually, and pay attention to how your joints respond. And crucially: Always speak with your doctor first, especially if you have existing joint problems, balance issues, or bone density concerns.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Plus, they're compact and easy to wrap. Best of all, these Mate tags from Tile are —especially while they're 50% off for Cyber Monday. \nThey work like this: You affix them to whatever you like, and then you can either see where the item is on a map on your phone or play an alarm. But that's only half of what makes these trackers useful, because also work in reverse: You can click a Mate and it will ring your phone in case you lose that.  A four pack of Mate trackers for $39.99 is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered, so this isn't an illusionary bargain, and it's much cheaper than Apple's competing product: A four-pack of AirTags lists for $99, and is currently on sale for $62.99.

They may be a couple of years old at this point, but they're still competitive, and now there's a Cyber Monday 2025 deal that's bringing them to more than half off. That's a fantastic deal on a really good product, and if you're in the market for over-ear noise cancelling headphones, you should definitely consider it.\nIn Amazon's Cyber Monday 2025 sale, the Bose QuietComfort Headphones are down to $159.99 (54% off) in black. The best thing about these headphones are the color choices it's available in, and the good news is that multiple color variants are going at $179.99 (50% off). That's still a decent savings, even if it's not quite as high as what you'd save on the more boring color.PCMag's review gave this product a 4/5, praising it for its controls, sound quality, and noise cancellation. This product misses out on support for newer Bluetooth codecs, unlike the pricier Bose QuietComfort Ultra ($399, 11% off). The older product doesn't charge as fast as the QC Ultra either, but it will still sound great. The review calls out the price for being a bit too high, but this Cyber Monday Sale rectifies that. You can now get the QuietComfort headphones for $239 less than the QuietComfort Ultra. I recently tried the QuietComfort headphones in-person, and I was impressed by the build quality and how light they felt on my head. The noise cancellation was also great. These types of headphones serve a dual purpose in my life. They cut out external noise during long flights, and they also keep my ears warm when I'm in windy places in the winter (looking at you, Scotland!). If you're not sure which over-ear headphones to get this Cyber Monday, look no further than the Bose QuietComfort ones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

Even now, it’s available for just $549 at Walmart. But now, I think the best cheap MacBook that you can buy is the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air for just $599 during Best Buy’s Cyber Monday sale. This laptop has the same modern design as the M4 MacBook Air and even comes with the same 16GB RAM.This isn't the only good MacBook Air deal right now, though—if you have the money to spare, you could opt for the latest M4 MacBook Air for $738 duringAmazon’s Cyber Monday sale. For most budget-conscious users, though, the $600 M2 MacBook Air is the best deal. The M2 MacBook Air has the same 13.5-inch Retina Display (with wide P3 color gamut and sharp resolution at 2560x1664), the same latest design, MagSafe connection, fast Touch ID, and nicer speakers, not to mention 16GB RAM, which is twice as much as the M1 MacBook Air. It supports Apple Intelligence as well, though that 16GB RAM will come in really handy in day-to-day tasks and will help with longevity as well.\nThe M2 chip is also no slouch. Compared to the M1 chip, you get 18% faster CPU, 35% faster GPU, and 40% faster Neural Engine. It’s more than capable for your daily work, email, and web browsing, and it can even take over some intense photo editing and video editing workflows. There’s 18 hours of battery life (15 when you’re web browsing). Again, that's more than enough to last a full workday, and then some. The M2 MacBook Air is also thin and light, as you’d expect, weighing in at 2.7 pounds (and just 1.13 cm thick).If you’re looking for a larger laptop, the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air is down to $769.99. The two laptops are virtually the same, down to the processor and quality of screen. The 15-inch model, of course, has a larger screen, and because of the extra space, has better speakers too. The weight is a different story though, with the 15-inch model weighing in at 1.51 kg, which is quite a bit heavier than the 13-inch MacBook Air.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

And for Cyber Monday, the Venu X1 is on sale for $599.99 ($200 off its normal price $799.99).\nThe X1 is Garmin's biggest screen—41 x 46 millimeters with a two-inch diagonal measurement—making it easy to view maps, data, and notifications at a glance. You also get an LED flashlight built into the watch, handy for early morning runs or fumbling with your keys in the dark. The scratch-resistant sapphire lens adds durability, while built-in maps mean you can navigate without pulling out your phone. There's also a speaker and microphone for taking calls or using a voice assistant directly from your wrist.Solid training and trackingThe X1 includes coaching for running, cycling, and strength training, plus all the health and fitness tracking Garmin is known for. It goes without saying that Garmin watches deliver excellent GPS accuracy and reliable heart rate readings—qualities that matter whether you're logging casual jogs or training for your next race.Beyond the usual activity profiles and running-specific metrics, the X1 supports a wide range of sports including motorcycling, rock climbing, and golfing (with extra features tailored to the course). The battery lasts up to eight days, so you won't be tethered to a charger constantly.If you prefer a round watch geared specifically toward serious runners and athletes, check out Garmin's high-end Fenix line also on sale today.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday or Cyber MondayWhen you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ \"Black Friday\" or \"Cyber Monday\" tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it's the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, impulse buyers may not fully realize what they're buying.How to tell if a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.To avoid a low-key scam, do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

You download the apps you want to use, log into your accounts, and presto: You can stream anything with a few clicks of your remote. But smart TV apps aren't the only way people watch shows and movies on platforms like Netflix. Among other methods, like plugging a laptop directly into the TV, many people still enjoying casting their content from small screens to big screens. For years, this has been a reliable way to switch from watching Netflix on your smartphone or tablet to watching on your TV—you just tap the cast button, select your TV, and in a few moments, your content is beamed to the proper place. Your device becomes its own remote, with search built right-in, and it avoids the need to sign into Netflix on TVs outside your home, such as when staying in hotels. At least it did, but Netflix no longer wants to let you do it.\nNetflix no longer supports casting on most devicesWhile you can still cast to your TV from other streaming platforms, there's bad news for Netflix fans: The company has abruptly dropped casting support for most devices. Android Authority was the first to report on the change, though you might have stumbled upon the development yourself when looking for the cast button in the Netflix app. In fact, Netflix has prepared for your confusion, as you can see from this Netflix Help Center page titled \"Can't find 'Cast' button in Netflix app.\" This page might offer a glimmer of hope at first, as you think \"Oh good, Netflix has a solution if the Cast button is missing.\" Unfortunately, the response isn't going to make you happy: \"Netflix no longer supports casting shows from a mobile device to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. You’ll need to use the remote that came with your TV or TV-streaming device to navigate Netflix.\"The exception here is for \"older\" Chromecast devices or TVs that work with Google Cast—but only if you pay for an ad-free Netflix plan. If you took Netflix up on its lower-cost subscription offer, those ads not only cost you extra watch time, but also your ability to cast—assuming you even have the older hardware to cast to. While Android Authority was the first major publication to report on the issue, some Netflix casters have been living with the change over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 14, this user posted on the Chromecast subreddit voicing their complaints about the change. They were particularly frustrated with the lack of communication from Netflix, as the Cast button was removed \"with zero warning.\" Other users in the thread noted their frustrations, too, with some threatening to cancel their subscriptions over the issue.  Why is Netflix removing support for casting?Netflix doesn't explain why it's making the change, so I can only speculate. First, it's totally possible this is simply a tech obsolescence issue. Many companies drop support for older or underused technologies, and perhaps Netflix sees now as the time to largely drop support for casting. Streamlining the tech the app has to support means less work for Netflix developers, and it wouldn't be the first time the company dropped support for older platforms. However, that doesn't really explain why the company still supports some devices for casting. Maybe it took a look at its user base, and made the calculation that enough subscribers relied on Google Cast devices for casting, but not enough relies on newer hardware for casting. We might not really know unless Netflix decides to issue a statement.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, I can't help but feel like this is related to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing. The company clearly doesn't want you using its services unless you have your own paid account—or have another user pay extra to have you on their account. Casting, however, makes it easy to continue using someone else's account without paying for it. Since Netflix only requires mobile users to log into the account owner's home wifi once a month to continue watching on a device, you could theoretically cast Netflix from your smartphone to your TV to continue enjoying your shows and movies \"for free.\" By removing casting as an option for most users, those users will either need to connect a device to the TV by wire—like a laptop connected via HDMI—or log into the smart TV app. And if those users don't actually have permission to access that account via that app, they won't be able to stream. If this really is the company's intention, it's doing so at the inconvenience of paying users, too. If you're traveling, you now need to bother with signing into your account on a TV you don't own. If you don't like using your smart TV apps, you're kind of out of luck, unless you want to deal with connecting a computer to your TV whenever you want to catch up on Stranger Things. How to fix Netflix casting issues with compatible hardware If you do meet the new requirements for casting on Netflix, and the cast button still isn't appearing, Netflix does have some troubleshooting steps you can take on its Help Center page. It's device-dependent, but generally, here's what you should do:Check your Chromecast's wifi network: You can ensure your Chromecast is actively connected to your wifi network from the Google Home app on your iPhone or Android device. Turn your device off and on again: If you're casting from your phone or tablet, power it off completely, then turn it back on again. Turn your Chromecast off and on again: If your device boots back up but the Cast button is still missing, power off and unplug your Chromecast for at least 15 seconds before turning it back on again. Sign out of Netflix: Log out of Netflix on the device you're trying to cast from. Turn off Chrome extensions: If you're using Chrome on a Mac or PC for casting, Netflix recommends turning off your browser extensions. (This seems like an extreme step in my opinion, especially if you're someone who relies on Chrome extension—but if it works, it works.)    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        More than 45 million people in the United States rent their homes, and as purchasing a home continues to be out of reach for many, that number probably isn’t going down anytime soon. If you’re a renter, you know that renting often comes with some compromises in terms of control over your environment, space, and interior design. Being limited in what you can do because you don’t actually own the walls and floors can be a real challenge when it comes to making the space nice.But with a few clever ideas, you can make your rental more comfortable, more useful, and less expensive—and ensure that you get all of your security deposit back when you move out. There are a lot of useful hacks out there for renters, but these are the fundamental, most useful hacks that you might not think of, but every renter should know.Upgrade the little thingsRenters—especially first-time renters—often assume that they can’t change anything in a rented place. This is absolutely not true—while you might not want to actually spend money on an actual renovation to a place you don’t own (although some people do just that), there are actually a lot of things you can temporarily upgrade to make your basic box of an apartment feel more luxurious.\nBasically, if you can remove it, you can swap it. Light fixtures, cabinet and drawer pulls, bathroom mirrors, shower heads, faucets, toilet seats, and wall plates can all be easily removed and replaced with better, more stylish options. You put the old stuff in storage until you move out, and then you just swap everything back—and take your nicer stuff with you to the next place.Peel-and-stick surfacesPainting is powerful, and it’s not uncommon for a landlord to allow you to paint your apartment or rental house, helping you to inject some color and personalization into the place. But paint can’t repair janky walls, and painting a whole apartment (or even one room) can be a messy prospect. And sometimes you want to jazz up a space with tile—like kitchen backsplashes.Peel-and-stick options like temporary, removable wallpaper or wall tiles is a prime hack. It covers any defects in the walls, offers an enormous range of styles and designs, and peels right off without leaving a mark when you move out. In some cases, you can even re-use the tile or wallpaper at your next home, if you’re really careful removing and storing it.Folding furniture in small spacesIf you’re renting a tiny space, like a studio apartment, making it feel larger and making it more functional can be a challenge, especially since you can’t just hire a contractor and renovate the heck out of it. If you’re puzzling out how to make a small space multifunctional and less cluttered, the answer is probably folding furniture.Wall desks that fold down, folding dining tables, folding chairs, freestanding Murphy beds—just about any furniture that you use can be found in folding format, allowing you to transform a space into several different rooms with just a few quick moves.Stove and sink covers for extra prep spaceApartments often come with small kitchens and bathrooms, which can make cooking and washing up an exercise in frustration. An easy hack is to pick up some stove and sink covers for both the kitchen and bathroom. These handy items are cheap and provide extra prep space when you need it, then lift away to let you use your stove and sinks for their intended purpose. They can make small bathrooms and kitchens a lot more functional.Install temporary flooringRentals often have floors that tell a fascinating story of abuse, damage, and poor design choices. From painted floors to carpets you’d prefer not to touch with your bare skin, nothing makes an apartment feel like a punishment than a terrible floor—and no amount of good taste on the walls or in your furniture choices will erase that awful floor.So, cover it. You may not be able to sand and stain an abused hardwood floor, or tear up a carpet that was last cleaned in the previous decade, but you can very effectively cover it with a temporary floor that will pop right off when it’s time to move. This hack not only beautifies the space while you’re living there, it also guarantees that you don’t add to the damage and get nicked for stains, tears, or gouges.This can be as simple as putting a rug over a gross carpet or putting peel-and-stick tile (or a vinyl rug) on a kitchen or bathroom floor. Deck tiles can upgrade a gouged and stained floor into an attractive and temporary surface. If you just want to cover an ugly floor and give your space a more modern, updated look, vinyl rolls are a cheap and easy option to install—and remove.Erase-A-Hole for covering wall damageDrywall is amazing stuff, but it’s not exactly strong. It’s very easy to dent, ding, and otherwise damage your walls just by living near them. And every dent and ding could cost you when it’s time to move out; while a strategically-placed piece of art might hide that hole in the wall, it’s eventually going to be a problem.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nLuckily, there’s Erase-A-Hole. With this stuff, you don’t have to spend six hours on YouTube learning how to mud and sand drywall repairs. You just rub the stick on the wall, let it dry, and then touch up the paint if necessary. If you love hanging things on your walls, this is going to save you hours of sweaty work when you move out.Get a stair-climbing cartIf your apartment is several flights up in a building without elevators, groceries soon become the biggest challenge in your life. Carrying heavy grocery bags up those stairs is not only a chore, it’s also an invitation to disaster because you’re probably going to try to carry everything in one trip, leading to broken bags, broken eggs, and possibly injuries because you can’t see your own feet.The stair-climbing cart is the hack you need. You use it as a normal grocery cart in the store, but when it’s time to get all those goods up to your apartment, it makes pulling everything up the stairs easy, safe, and fast.Install lots of tension rodsTension rods aren’t just for shower curtains. Investing in a pack of simple tension rods can transform your rented home in a wide variety of ways:Use them to hang curtains without drilling into wallsPlace them inside kitchen cabinets to create extra vertical storage (and under the sink to hang all those cleaning bottles)They can also be placed vertically inside cabinets to organize baking sheets and other flatwareMaximize closet storage with closet trianglesCloset space is always a challenge in small rentals. That’s why every renter should know about these closet triangles. They can dramatically increase the storage capacity of any closet, allowing you to hang several shirts or pants in the same space without making any changes to the closet itself. They work with any type of hanger, and you’ll be able to use the extra space in your closet for any other storage needs you might have.Take a video diary when you move inWhen you sign a rental contract, you’re taking on a legal responsibility for the condition of the apartment. When you move out, landlords are quick to pounce on any perceived damage that goes beyond “wear and tear” from normal living. After living there for years, are you going to remember if that stain on the floor was already there? And even if you remember, can you prove it?Before you move in, take a video of the place as you walk through. Focus in on anything that’s already stained, scuffed, damaged, or simply aged. Take your time and fully document the condition of the place. When you move out, you’ll be able to demonstrate that you left the place in the same condition you found it, and ensure you get your security deposit back.\n            ",

Normally $129.99, this home gym storage rack is currently on sale for $79.98. If you've been tripping over scattered dumbbells or wasting time hunting for the right weights mid-workout, this deal solves both problems for under $80.\nThis weight rack is specifically designed for a home gym. There are designated spaced for dumbbells, kettlebells, yoga blocks, resistance bands, medicine balls, and more—basically all the smaller equipment that tends to pile up in corners or get kicked under furniture. Having everything organized in one storage rack means you can actually find what you need when you need it.I recommend a dedicated storage rack like this so you can really focus on your fitness goals without the distraction of a cluttered space. In other words: No more digging through a heap of equipment or making multiple trips across your garage to grab different dumbbells between sets. Everything has its place, and you can grab what you need and get back to training.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It saves me a lot of money, and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.The AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.Does Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

Security researchers are warning of an uptick in scams capitalizing on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype. Fraudsters know that they can prey on shoppers' sense of urgency and excitement for limited-time, exclusive deals—and AI is making these campaigns even more difficult to spot than usual. New data from McAfee suggest that nearly half of Americans have come across an AI-powered scam while shopping, from deepfakes impersonating celebrities pushing promotions to near-flawless spoofed websites that steal your credit card information. \nSpoofed websites are a common type of a scam, and fraudsters use holiday shopping season to trap users with fake retail sites and sales pages that look legitimate but are actually just collecting data like your login credentials and payment information. Scammers will use stolen assets like logos and product photos from known and trusted brands, and AI makes it easy to set up a convincing (but fake) small business website with elements like a customer service page and consumer reviews in no time. Another shopping scam facilitated by AI is the impersonation scam. You think you're watching a popular influencer or celebrity promoting an exclusive deal or product giveaway on TikTok or another social media platform, but it's actually a deepfake. If you click through to enter or buy, you'll land on a counterfeit page (as outlined above) designed to steal from you. According to Google's November fraud and scam advisory, scammers can get eyes on their content by hijacking search terms for Black Friday sales, running deceptive ads, or pushing deals on social media. Fake storefronts may appear as sponsored links, which are easy to overlook if you're in a rush to make a purchase. Of course, you may encounter other common holiday scams, such as fake shipping notifications that request payment in order to resolve a delivery issue as well as account verification scams that prompt you to confirm personal details. These phishing and smishing campaigns use standard scam tactics like impersonating a legitimate company or service and sending a fraudulent link that collects your bank information or username and password combination. Black Friday and Cyber Monday scam red flags When shopping holiday deals, slow down enough to look for common signs of scams. Fraudsters will use urgency—such as a limited time to secure a deal or a limited number of items left in stock—in hopes you won't think before you buy. You should also be wary of any deal that is too good to be true, or a promotion with especially low prices that are out of line with other sales on similar items. This includes influencers pushing \"exclusive\" opportunities. If you are purchasing from a small business you don't know, google the brand and read third-party reviews to see whether it is legitimate. Instead of clicking links from emails, texts, and social media posts promoting sales, go directly to the retailer's website and search for the deal. If you do click through, check the URL carefully to ensure it is legitimate (scammers may use homoglyphs that avoid detection at first glance) and look for website elements that real companies have, such as a privacy policy and address. If you see a promotion on social media, check the creator's account to see when they joined the platform, what they've posted in the past, and whether they are verified. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBeware of any site that requires you to pay with a gift card, cryptocurrency, or bank transfer versus a credit card, which has some protection in the case of fraud. Legitimate retailers will use legitimate payment methods. Finally, never enter your login credentials unless you've confirmed that the site you're using is trustworthy. This includes delivery services and your Amazon and PayPal accounts, all of which scammers may pressure you to \"verify\" in order to resolve a billing or delivery issue. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

If I hadn’t bought my M4 Pro MacBook Pro last year, this is what I would probably get right now. The M5 chip is a substantial upgrade over the M4, especially in the AI department. And for Cyber Monday, Amazon is discounting the already fresh M5 MacBook Pro down to $1,349. That’s down from the sticker price of $1,599, a savings of $250.\nAt that rate, the M5 MacBook Pro becomes attractive for anyone who wants a Mac laptop that is going to last for ages. The M5 MacBook Pro is a sizable upgrade over the MacBook Air, too, thanks to its superior 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display (after using this, going back to my 4K monitor is really tough, I’ll tell you that). This XDR display has Mini-LED backlighting, a ProMotion 120Hz display, and 1,600 nits peak HDR brightness.The M5, meanwhile, is a new 10-core CPU that Apple says is 15% faster than the M4. The real gains are in graphics and AI. The new 10-core GPU comes with a neural accelerator integrated into each core. This boosts on-device AI workflows by up to 3.5 times. It’s a sizable jump if you’re running third-party on-device AI models as well. Graphics are better by up to 30%, too, with Apple’s third-gen ray tracing tech. Gaming on the Mac might finally be a no-compromise affair (although compatibility is still limited depending on the title).Along with 16GB RAM, there’s a 512GB SSD and a massive 24-hour battery life. The battery on my M4 Pro MacBook Pro isn’t as great as I’d want it to be. The M5 is more efficient, lasts longer and runs cooler as well. You can also use it for intense workflows like photo editing and video editing, and it can handle sustained thermal loads thanks to its built-in fan cooling. There’s also a nice 12MP Center Stage webcam up top, and a six-speaker sound system with Spacial audio. The speakers are genuinely amazing. When my wife and I watch something in bed, we no longer need to connect to Bluetooth speakers (like we do when using my wife’s MacBook Air).If you’re looking for something cheaper, or lighter, take a look at the M4 MacBook Air, which is deeply discounted to just $738 for Cyber Monday, another staggering deal.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Cyber Monday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Since their release in 2022, the AirPods Pro 2 have received multiple software updates to add features such as controlling Siri with head movements, reduced latency, improved call quality, and more. Even today, they remain a fantastic pair of earbuds, especially now that the Cyber Monday 2025 sale has dropped the price to a record low.\nDuring Amazon-owned Woot's Cyber Monday 2025 sale, the AirPods Pro 2 are going for $135, which is 46% off the list price of $250. Sure, some of you are going to want the latest and greatest product in the lineup, the AirPods Pro 3 ($220, 12% off, during Cyber Monday 2025), but for most people, the AirPods Pro 2 are an amazing choice at this price.Every time I've used the AirPods Pro 2, I've been impressed by their comfort and noise cancellation features. The ANC cuts out a lot of noise in loud places, including concert venues, and for me, they've been a great companion on long flights.The AirPods Pro 2 work best with Apple products, but they're also compatible with other Bluetooth devices such as a Windows PC or an Android phone. Having said that, if you want to make the most of the AirPods Pro 2, you should pair them with your Apple devices for the seamless device switching, instant pairing, and host of software features that don't work with other platforms.I've used the AirPods Pro 2 during workouts at the gym, for cycling, and while running half-marathons. They've have never disappointed me through all these situations. I love recommending slightly older products when they're heavily discounted, and with the AirPods Pro 2 getting such a good deal during Cyber Monday 2025, you're basically getting a current-gen product at last-gen prices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.

This is the lowest price ever, according to price-tracking tools. The other colors, including black, pink, and blue, are listed for $129 at Walmart and $129.95 on Amazon, which is also a decent deal at 35% off. \nThe Beats Solo 4 offer well-balanced sound and are particularly high-value for those in the Apple ecosystem. This is because Apple-owned Beats by Dre integrated features like hands-free Siri and personalized spatial audio into this iteration of the Beats Solo. The headphones also have one-touch pairing with most Apple devices, automatic pairing via iCloud, audio sharing, and simultaneous connection with your iPhone and Apple Watch. PCMag gives the Beats Solo 4 a \"good\" review. The headphones don't have Active Noise Cancellation, an adjustable EQ option, or an Android-friendly codec. Beats headphones, in general, are a decent affordable alternative to premium headphones from Apple and Sony. Its over-ear Studio Pro headphones are also on sale for Cyber Monday, as are the Apple AirPods Max and the Sony WH-1000XM6. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday and Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025.

The sale ends after Cyber Monday. Once you've purchased, the redemption code and setup instructions will be sent to your inbox. Just make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (like a 1GHz processor, 4GB RAM, TPM 2.0, and UEFI firmware, among others). This isn’t an upgrade path for unsupported PCs—it’s a fresh install for machines that meet the full list of Windows 11 Pro requirements.The Windows 11 Pro layout is cleaner, Snap Layouts and virtual desktops make multitasking smoother, and redocking windows actually works like you'd expect. If you’re into voice typing or just want better search across apps and docs, it delivers. Windows 11 Pro also includes some solid professional tools, such as BitLocker for encryption, Hyper-V for virtualization, and even a sandbox mode for testing apps safely. You’re also getting DirectX 12 Ultimate, so your hardware can shine during gaming or graphics-intensive tasks, assuming your machine is sufficiently powerful.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWindows 11 Pro also doubles down with biometric login, Smart App Control, and TPM 2.0 requirements, which makes it a tougher nut to crack. It also includes the new AI-powered Copilot and baked-in Microsoft Teams support, which might appeal to remote workers. Just a heads up, you won’t get an Office upgrade bundled in with this deal—this is strictly a Windows license. It will work alongside Office if you have a separate license, though (if you’re on a Mac using Parallels Pro). Overall, this $10 deal is about as straightforward and affordable as it gets.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations.

It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.Recently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.As scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.But the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.Political phishing schemes are nothing newThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.And then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.How to spot a political phishing scamWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.Remember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Justin Pot\n                                \n                                            Justin Pot is a freelance journalist who helps people get more out of technology.\n                                    \n                Read Justin's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Justin\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The feature was intuitive, and to quote my colleague Jake Peterson, it's worked so seamlessly that it was almost like Quick Share and AirDrop \"were built this way from the beginning.\" But for other Android users, it continued to be business as usual, leading to awkward texts and emails to share files across iOS and Android. Now, though, Google confirmed it's working to bring AirDrop to other Android phones, too, including phones it doesn't make. At an event attended by Android Authority, Android Vice President of Engineering Eric Kay said, \"Last year, we launched AirDrop interoperability. In 2026, we're going to be expanding it to a lot more devices.\"To a degree, we kind of knew this was coming. While many Pixel only features are implemented via a special Pixel-only system component, Google added AirDrop compatibility to the Pixel 10 by upgrading Quick Share from a system level feature to a full-on app, with its own APK. That laid the groundwork for other Android phones to eventually get AirDrop compatibility of their own, since they can all use this app. For instance, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said in November that his team was \"already exploring\" adding AirDrop compatibility to Nothing phones, while chipmaker Qualcomm said it \"can't wait\" for the feature to be enabled on Snapdragon—commonly used in Samsung's Galaxy phones—in the \"near future.\"Now, it seems like the wait for AirDrop across the rest of Android won't be much longer. While Kay didn't give an exact timeline beyond 2026, he did say that Google is already \"working with our partners to expand it into the rest of the ecosystem, and you should see some exciting announcements very soon.\" That's it as far as official communication goes, but I've reached out to Google for additional comment and will update if I can snag more details. In the meantime, we do have a few possible dates where we could expect the feature to be announced.\nThe soonest might be the next Samsung Unpacked, where the company is expected to announce the S26 lineup of phones. According to rumors, that'll take place on Feb. 25, and it's not unusual for Google to make an appearance during Unpacked to discuss new features coming to Android that the new phones can take advantage of. Alternatively, Google might save the announcement for its next Google I/O event, which would likely be sometime in May. Or it could just drop the feature online without the fanfare of an official event.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEither way, I can't wait. I take a lot of photos on my phone for this job, and while sending them from my personal iPhone to my work Mac usually isn't an issue, getting them off an Android phone I might be reviewing can be a much bigger pain. As someone who's got an Android tablet, an iPhone, a MacBook, and a Windows PC all within 5 feet of me right now, anything that helps bridge these ecosystems together is a good move in my book.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This year's broadcast, hosted on NBC, includes pregame coverage starting at 1 p.m. ET and a pregame show featuring Green Day at 6 p.m. ET. Even if you don't have cable, there are a few ways, both paid and free, that you can watch all the action live from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. You can watch Super Bowl LX on PeacockThe game will be shown on NBC-owned streaming service Peacock, which is available on the web as well as iOS, Android, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. Peacock doesn't have a free trial, and you have to subscribe to the middle tier—Peacock Premium, which costs $11 per month—to get live sports. Or you can pay $17 per month for ad-free Premium Plus (live sports still have ads). There are a few ways to get around subscribing at full price. Peacock Premium is a perk of both a Walmart+ subscription ($98 per year after a 30-day free trial) and an Instacart+ subscription ($99 per year after a 14-day free trial), so if you have or would benefit from either of these services, now may be the time to sign up. Students qualify for a discounted rate of $6 per month for Peacock Premium. Note that Peacock will also have streaming and on-demand coverage of the Winter Olympics, which begin this weekend, so subscribing for a month may be well worth $11. \nSign up for a live TV streaming serviceThere are a handful of streaming services with live TV that include NBC. Before signing up, check the channel listings for your zip code to confirm NBC is available in your local market. DirectTV Stream: $50 per month for the first month with current promotions, 5-day free trialHulu + Live TV: $90 per month, 3-day free trial (includes ads on Hulu)YouTube TV: Currently $70 per month with promo, 21-day free trial for new usersSling TV (in limited markets): $46 per monthWhen signing up for a free trial, make sure you know when you'll be billed for a paid subscription and cancel before your trial expires. The game will be available in 4K for YouTube TV subscribers (included in the free trial but at an additional fee or at a higher tier with paid plans). The Spanish-language broadcast will be on Telemundo, which is also available on most live TV streaming services. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to watch Super Bowl LX over the airAnother free (ish) way to get the game is with over-the-air (OTA) TV. Of course, this requires you to invest in a digital TV antenna and have a place to put it that gets good reception. You should check the FCC's reception map to see what signals are available in your area and try your antenna out before game day.

But on Reddit, some people who already own Whoop 5.0 bands are buying up old 4.0 bands to get a bargain on the subscription price. There have been a few posts on this, but perhaps the master of this hack is Redditor u/thelifeofcb, who found Whoop 4.0 bands, new in box, at a T. J. Maxx store for $39 each, and bought several. This allowed them to extend their existing subscription—they wear a Whoop 5.0—for several years at essentially a $200/year discount.How the discount Whoop hack worksWhen new Whoop bands are sold through retailers, they come packaged with a one-year subscription. The idea is that you’ll create an account on the app, pair the band you bought through the app, and get credit for a 12-month subscription—since that was the main thing you paid for when you bought the band at full price. \nBack in the Whoop 4.0 days, there was only one tier of membership. When tiers were introduced, those subscriptions rolled over to a Peak subscription, the one that currently goes for $239/year. That means a 4.0 device—however much you pay for it—can give you a year-long Peak subscription. Redditors have found that pairing one of these new Whoop 4.0 devices added a year’s subscription to their accounts, whether they were a new customer or not. That means you can buy a few discount bands, pair them all, and enjoy several years’ worth of discounted membership. That $39 band is thus a $200 discount on each year’s membership. Some say that they received an offer to upgrade to a Whoop 5.0 band if they added two years' worth of membership (paired two bands).That $39 price is an unusually good one, but you can still get a significant discount anywhere new Whoop 4.0 devices are sold. For example, Amazon has 4.0 devices right now for $124, which is still about half the price of a Peak subscription. You can find them cheaper on eBay, but I’d be wary of buying a box that may have been opened. I’ll explain that below. Scoring a cheap Whoop won't always work, thoughWhile Redditors say this works—and it does fit with my understanding of how subscriptions are paid for and claimed in the app—there are a few pitfalls to beware of. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe first is that this applies to new-in-box devices that (1) are sold with a subscription, and (2) have never been paired. The hack would not work with a hand-me-down device that has already been used, nor with a new one that has already been paired and its subscription claimed. For example, you can’t pass the same band to a friend and expect it to give both of you a subscription. This means you have to be sure the band you buy has not been opened. If a store accepts returns of opened items, they may not realize that the valuable item here—the digital subscription—has already been claimed. If they put it back on the shelf, and you buy it, you’re out the purchase price and you still don’t have a subscription. The other issue is just the e-waste that this causes. You’re buying a device just to throw it in the trash. But I’d argue that’s Whoop’s fault, not yours—those devices are obsolete and headed for the landfill (or responsible electronics recycling program, if you can find one) regardless of what you do. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Back in ancient times, I had to google the lyrics to the songs I was listening to—which was fine if I was near a computer, but impossible when I was on the go with my iPod. This is probably why there are so many songs I think I know the words to, only to discover, once I read the actual lyrics, that I am sorely mistaken. Built-in lyrics are thus a feature that is equal parts useful and humbling. As it happens, Spotify's existing lyrics features are getting some upgrades to kick off February. The company announced three key updates on Wednesday—two that impact free users, and one exclusive to Premium subscribers. Spotify might not offer Apple Music's dynamic lyrics, but these updates should still be welcomed by anyone who likes reading along to their music. Spotify now supports offline lyricsThe biggest announcement of the day—in my opinion, anyway—is offline support for lyrics. This is always something that frustrates me whenever I'm using my phone without cellular service. Say I download some albums to listen to on a flight: When I try to listen to them in airplane mode, lyrics are unavailable. Being able to download the lyrics when you grab a song or album is a small but actually meaningful upgrade.\nUnfortunately, offline lyrics are not available free of charge: At this time, the feature is only available to Premium subscribers, which makes sense, given that free users can't download music for offline listening anyway—only podcasts.Lyrics are moving to a new location in the Spotify appTraditionally, lyrics have appeared at the bottom of the player window in the Spotify app. To view them, you need to scroll down, then tap on the lyrics window to fully expand it. It seems Spotify wasn't content with this UI. The company says that in its testing, it finds that placing the lyrics directly below the album art, rather than below the player, makes them easier to interact with. And so that's where the lyrics are moving. The company calls these \"lyrics previews,\" as you see just a snippet of the lyrics at one time. This change is rolling out to both free and Premium users on iOS and Android. If you'd rather not see the lyrics at all, you can tap the three-dot menu and choose \"Lyrics Off.\"\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify is adamant that this new placement won't change lyric sharing. You'll still be able to send specific lyrics to friends and social media platforms. You'll just need to do so from the new lyrics window. Spotify now support lyrics translations worldwideSpotify's lyrics translation feature makes it easy to figure out what artists are singing about when you don't speak their particular language. When you listen to a song that doesn't match your device's system language, you'll find a translate button in the lyrics window. Tap that, and Spotify will include translations beneath each line of the song, so you can follow along. According to Spotify, this feature was available in more than 25 markets as of the end of last year, but now, the company is rolling out the feature worldwide. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

For the second time in two years, the streaming service is raising prices, this time across all of its plans, including the entry-level Fan Tier. This comes shortly after the company discontinued its free, ad-supported tier on Dec. 31.The new tiers and their pricing will be as follows:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Fan Tier will go up from $7.99/month to $9.99/month. This tier offers basic access to the full Crunchyroll library, and the ability to download shows to a single device for offline viewing.The Mega Fan tier will go up from $11.99/month to $13.99/month. At this tier, you can stream on up to four devices at once, download content in HD for offline viewing, and get access to the Crunchyroll Game Vault.The Ultimate Fan Tier will go up from $15.99/month to $17.99/month. This tier adds access to Crunchyroll Manga, streaming on up to six devices at once, and a swag bag after you've been subscribed to this plan for a year. The new pricing will kick in on your first billing date after March 4. If you're not already subscribed, however, there's still a little bit of time to sign up and get the (slightly) lower price for your first month. While existing users can't lock in the lower price, Crunchyroll is offering a limited-time upgrade to an annual plan for the Fan Tier for $66.99/year, which comes out to $5.58/month.

It's not your internet connection, and it isn't your OpenAI account: ChatGPT is down. According to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, users started reporting issues with ChatGPT at 11:56 a.m. ET. Those reports ballooned by 12:11 p.m., as the total number of incidents as of this article currently sits above 7,000. If you're an avid ChatGPT user, you might have also had issues with the bot yesterday: Downdetector shows over 25,000 reports of down time starting at 2:56 p.m. Tuesday and resolving around 4:11 p.m. the same day. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with all outages, OpenAI will likely figure out a patch for the issue soon enough. But these outages are becoming more common. There was the Verizon outage, of course, but other services like TikTok have also experienced intermittent periods of downtime. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can see how long each track is, who performed it, and maybe even the song writing credits, but you don't know why the artist wrote the song, or what each song is supposed to mean. You can, of course, scour the internet, looking at articles and blogs to learn more about your favorite music—or, you can skim Spotify's new summary cards that offer fun facts about each track. Spotify announced the new feature, called \"About the Song,\" on Friday. The feature, which is launching in beta, is available in the app's Now Playing View. When you select it, you'll see story cards you can swipe through that tell you more about the song you're listening to. Spotify says the stories are summarized from \"third-party sources,\" and in my testing, I've seen sources like Hypebeast, Wikipedia, and fan sites. The company also tells me that \"some systems\" of the feature use machine learning to generate these summaries, which means About the Song is, in part, AI-generated.  \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Spotify\n                    \n    \nAs with many of Spotify's new features, About the Song is only available for Premium subscribers. At this time, it's also limited to English accounts in the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. If you pay for Spotify in one of these regions, the feature is exceptionally easy to find. When you're listening to a song, just scroll down on the page until you see the \"About the Song\" card. If you don't see it, that song likely doesn't support the feature. Some songs will only have one summary card, but others may have more. If so, you'll see icons in the top right of the card window telling you which card you're reading. You can swipe left on the card to open the next. \nI've seen songs with as many as four of these cards, though it's possible some songs have even more. Some of those are all summarized from the same source—say, one Wikipedia article—while others pull from multiple sources to generate multiple About the Song cards. There are thumbs-up and thumbs-down options on each card to rate the summary, implying these are AI-generated. The summaries appear to be static once generated though—when I quit the app and return, the summaries are the same. I'd be curious to know if the summaries are the same for everyone who chooses a song, or if they're generated for each individual listener.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSpotify has had a busy week. On Thursday, one day before announcing \"About the Song,\" the company revealed its plans to start selling physical paper books, which sync with its digital audiobooks. The day before that, Spotify revamped its lyrics feature, including the option to download lyrics for offline viewing. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

That also undercuts its current $339.99 price on Amazon, and price trackers suggest this is the lowest it has ever been. Woot's deal runs for another three weeks or until stock sells out, so don't wait too long to make a decision here. Amazon Prime members get free standard shipping (while everyone else pays $6), though shipping is limited to the contiguous U.S. \nThis is Samsung’s most feature-heavy watch, and the LTE connectivity means you can leave your phone at home and still take calls, send texts, and stream music. That alone gives it a strong edge over wifi-only smartwatches, especially for runners, cyclists, or folks trying to spend less time glued to their phones.This model is part of Samsung’s latest Watch 8 lineup, which launched last summer, and it has already earned strong praise, including an “excellent” review from PCMag, which named it the best Android smartwatch of 2025. Its Super AMOLED display is bright enough to read outdoors, even in harsh sunlight, and the interface feels responsive thanks to Samsung’s Exynos W1000 processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health tracking goes well beyond steps, with support for a wide range of fitness and wellness tools, including heart rate, ECG, temperature, blood oxygen, and even antioxidant levels. Google Gemini also comes preloaded for smarter voice control. That said, this watch plays best with Samsung phones. You’ll need any Android 12+ phone to use it, but some of the more advanced features, like snoring detection, are locked to Samsung devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe trade-off, as with most Samsung watches, is battery life. Real-world usage lands around 26 hours, so daily charging is part of the routine. That won’t work for everyone. On the upside, durability is solid, with IP68 dust and water resistance, a 5ATM swim rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification for tougher conditions. If you’re all-in on Samsung and want a fully independent smartwatch, this deal makes a lot of sense, especially at this price. But, if you’re still weighing options, see how it stacks up against Google’s flagship wearable, the Pixel Watch 4, here.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you often feel low on energy, one of the first things you should ask yourself is how much sleep you're getting. Good sleep also helps our overall health, our recovery from exercise, our ability to focus, and more. And while there are plenty of gadgets and biohacks that claim to help, the fundamentals of sleep hygiene are basic and simple. How to know if you need more sleepMost adults need seven to nine hours of sleep, on average, each night. This varies: you might be a seven-hour person or a nine-hour person. (Young people usually need even more; older adults may be okay with less.) So if you’re feeling tired all the time, an easy gut check is to note how much time you spend in bed, on average. If it's fewer than seven hours, it's probably not enough. And even if it's within that seven- to nine-hour window, try getting an extra hour or two of sleep for a few days in a row. If you feel a lot better, you have your answer. Wearables like smartwatches and rings can help collect data, but remember that the main thing they can tell you is how much sleep you're getting. (Sleep \"quality\" scores and even sleep stages are not necessarily reliable.) To call out a few of my favorites: the Oura ring is pricey ($349-$499) but comfortable to wear and presents data nicely. The Amazfit Helio Strap is a bargain at $99 and can track workouts, too. Garmin's Index Sleep Band ($169) is built for comfort while you sleep, but gives the same data as Garmin watches, so you may just want to find a watch you like and stick with that. If you have trouble waking up on time but easily fall asleep when you’re sitting quietly (like watching a movie), that's another sign you're probably not getting enough sleep. If you sleep in when you get the chance, your wake-up time is another hint. If you sleep in two hours or more past your normal time, that's your body applying a short-term fix (getting enough sleep now) to a long-term problem (chronically getting too little sleep). If you know you should sleep more, but you can’t seem to figure out how, below are the basics of sleep hygiene you need to master.Stick to a sleep scheduleSet a wake-up time that you can stick to every day. Consistency is important here: don’t set the alarm for 6 a.m. on weekdays and sleep until noon on weekends. If you can’t be perfectly consistent—for example, if you work different shifts—adjust as needed, but try to do your best. Next comes setting a bedtime. Figure out what time you need to hit the hay to get enough sleep before your alarm goes off. Then work backward from that to figure out when to start changing into jammies and whatever else your nighttime routine involves. (More on that routine below.)Crucial to both steps is prioritizing sleep so you can actually get yourself on schedule. If you’ve been having trouble getting enough sleep lately, give yourself a week or two to make your bedtime and wake-up time (and nine or so hours in between) the highest priority appointments in your calendar. Don’t go out too late, and don’t stay up revenge procrastinating. There will be time for occasional indulgences once your everyday schedule is more consistent. Include these four things in your bedtime routineOkay, so what goes into that routine? Feel free to personalize the specifics, but sleep experts recommend that you include the following as basic building blocks: At least 30 minutes dedicated to winding down. Don’t expect to switch off the lights and instantly be able to zonk out.No screens right before bedtime. No, not even with blue-blocking glasses. Those glasses don’t actually block very much blue light anyway. Videos and social media keep your brain awake and unrelaxed, so they don’t really have a place in your wind-down time anyway. Dim the lights. A cool, dark bedroom makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Do something relaxing. Read a chill book. Take a luxurious bath. Do some breathing exercises. Whatever works for you. Sticking to this routine not only helps you get into a relaxed mood for sleeping, it also helps you stick to that sleep schedule you set in the first step. After all, you can't be halfway through a movie at 10 p.m. if you refrained from starting it at 9 p.m.Set your body clock during the daySleep and darkness aren't the only things that set your body's circadian rhythms. Daytime activities help to keep your internal clock on track, and these can help your overall health as well.Get plenty of sunlight in the morning. (In the winter, a light box may help.) Exercise during the day. You can combine this with sunlight by going for a morning or lunchtime walk. But any type of exercise will help you to sleep better. Eat meals earlier in the day. We sleep best when we eat during the daytime; if a nice early breakfast fits your schedule, consider making it a regular thing. But at the very least, don’t eat right before bed. Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the eveningsCaffeine keeps you up, and its effects linger longer than you may realize. Caffeine has a half-life of five hours, with some of us processing it a little faster or a little slower. To put this another way, If the average person has a 250-milligram cup of coffee at noon (such as a Starbucks Tall sized brewed coffee), they'll still have about 125 milligrams in their system at 5 p.m. and 63 milligrams at 10 p.m.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe speed with which we break down caffeine varies from person to person, but in general: It’s affecting you more than you realize. If you think of yourself as a person who “can have an energy drink and then fall right to sleep” you are probably (a) in denial—hey, you’re the one who clicked on an article about getting better sleep—and/or (b) you have built up a massive caffeine tolerance because you drink so much of the stuff to stay awake, which in turn is because you don’t get enough sleep so you’re tired all the time. Do yourself a favor and break the cycle. An easy way to back off is to give yourself a cutoff time. No caffeine after 5 p.m., let’s say. Once that’s part of your routine, walk it back to 2 p.m. or noon. Alcohol is another chemical that affects our sleep. A nightcap before bed may make you feel sleepy, but it tends to disrupt the quality of your sleep. If you aren’t convinced, just start keeping a sleep diary—on paper is fine if you don’t have a sleep-tracking gadget—and see if you don’t get more and better sleep on the nights you don’t drink.Make your bedroom a dark little caveA welcoming, cozy bed will help you get to sleep faster. Make it dark, with blackout curtains or an eye mask, if needed. Make it quiet, with a white noise machine or earplugs if you can’t completely silence your surroundings. And make it a comfortable temperature. Most people prefer a cool environment—usually around 66 degrees—but again, this varies from person to person.Comfortable sheets and pillows can help. If you’re always tossing and turning, try to figure out if there’s something that physically bothers you. A new mattress might not be in the budget, but a mattress topper or a different pillow is an easy fix.ExperimentWhile the tips here are the basic things you should at least try, you may not need every single aspect to be textbook. I freeze if my room is set to 66 degrees, for example, so I keep the thermostat a tick warmer and I make sure I always have a warm duvet, even in summertime. You may find that you can bend certain rules but not others. I always have a crappy night’s sleep if I’ve been drinking, but late meals don’t bother me much. Once you’re getting a solid night’s sleep on the regular, you can start playing with the routine. And if you’re doing everything you can for good sleep hygiene and you still feel tired all the time, consider seeking medical help in case you have sleep apnea or another condition that could be affecting your sleep or energy levels.\n            \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Beth Skwarecki\n                                    Senior Health Editor\n                                \n                                            Covering health, fitness tech, home gym equipment, and more.\n                                    \n                Read Beth's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by Beth\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

The Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is currently selling for just $44.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $99.99, and price-tracking tools show that's the lowest it has ever been. It’s a wired camera, so it replaces an existing outdoor light and runs on household power. In exchange, you get a 1080p camera with a wide 143-degree field of view and dual LED floodlights that emit 2,600 lumens.\nIn daylight, this camera's footage looks sharp with natural colors, and the wide-angle camera does a good job covering a driveway or yard on its own. At night, the camera switches to infrared black-and-white video that stays clear up to 30 feet, and when the floodlights activate, you get full color night video, making it easier to recognize faces, animals, or vehicles.You'll also get motion alerts on your phone, and the live view in the Blink app loads fast enough to check what’s happening in real time. You can also use the two-way audio to speak through the camera, turn the lights on manually, or trigger the 105-decibel siren to draw attention via the app, according to PCMag's review. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs for the limitations of this floodlight camera, it mostly comes down to subscriptions and ecosystem support. You can view live video and receive motion alerts for free, but recording clips and using person detection requires a Blink subscription. The Basic plan costs $4 per month for one camera, while the Plus plan is $12 per month and covers multiple devices with 60 days of storage. Local storage is possible, but only if you buy the Blink Sync Module 2 ($49.99) and add your own USB drive. Also, while the camera integrates easily with Alexa and IFTTT, there’s no Google Home or Apple HomeKit support, which might matter depending on your smart home setup. Still, for under $50, this is a cost-efficient way to add real lighting and usable security footage in one upgrade.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Now Malwarebytes has joined the ChatGPT app store, which means you can get some expert help when investigating web links, emails, text messages, domains, and phone numbers you think might be suspicious.The app is free to use for everyone, whether or not they're signed up to a paid ChatGPT subscription, and you can enable the tool via the ChatGPT app store or by entering the prompt \"Malwarebytes, is this a scam?\" Once you've used the app for the first time, you can access it again via the + (plus) button on the prompt box.Malwarebytes' ChatGPT app can test links, sites, and phone numbers\n    \n            \n            Malwarebytes will do a deep security dive into links you provide.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can paste just about anything you like into a conversation with the Malwarebytes plugin, but there are certain approaches that scammers will often take—including links contained in phishing emails—that make for good candidates to test this thing out. I dived deep into my email spam folder to find some URLs to test Malwarebytes on, and gave it a few trustworthy web addresses as well—you just copy the link into the prompt box and ask the app for an assessment.\nMalwarebytes successfully sifted out the scam links from the safe ones, even when it didn't have any specific information in its databases about the links I was providing. When it was unsure, it said so, with lots of extra context: For example, for one URL I was told the address was \"a legitimate email security and tracking service used by companies to rewrite links\" but one that scammers also used to conceal the link destination.You also get an assessment of the domain name: When given a link to a Lifehacker article, the plugin correctly identified that it was a legitimate domain with a registered owner, even though it didn't have any specific information about the URL. Malwarebytes was also able to spot domain redirecting, a trick frequently used by scammers.Phone numbers can be given to Malwarebytes as well: When I tested this out with a few scam calls I've had, these numbers were correctly identified as coming from scammers or at least being suspicious. I like the way the app gives you some context to its thinking (explaining how spam call centers work, for example), and will also offer up advice about next steps and how to stay safe.Something else I appreciated was that the Malwarebytes app has a memory inside ChatGPT: If you post a series of links and numbers in the same chat thread, as I did, then it will try and put them all in context (explaining why one URL is potentially more dangerous than another, for example).The Malwarebytes ChatGPT app can also look at messages and emails\n    \n            \n            You'll get a list back of red flags in email and text message content.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can also give the Malwarebytes app some text you've come across in an email or text message and get a verdict on this too—you can even type in a transcript of a conversation you're having on the phone, if you want. The plugin will scan the text for phrasing that scammers often use and will alert you of any other red flags.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nI tried this out with a variety of spammy text, and again Malwarebytes scored highly in terms of recognizing anything dodgy. As before, if it came across something it wasn't sure about, it would explain the reasons why and suggest some next steps. The responses also include some detail on why different scam approaches are taken and why they sometimes work, and how they might escalate—so if you get a message purporting to be from a family member asking for help, Malwarebytes tells you why these scams are common and how they're used to steal identities or money.It's an intelligent system, in that it'll ask you questions about the texts or emails you've received: If it's not sure about something, you'll be told about extra checks you can run (like looking at the \"reply to\" address on an email). However, the usual ChatGPT sycophancy does start to grate a bit, as you're constantly told that you're doing the right thing and that you're right to be suspicious.The app taps into Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence, so it should be able to keep you protected against the latest threats (making it more helpful than a Google search or just a regular ChatGPT query). From the examples I used at least, it comes across as a security tool that's accurate, comprehensive, and easy to use—one that's well worth keeping close at hand if you come across potential scams you're not sure about.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If the Sony XM6, which I called the best over-ear headphones of 2025 (and 2026 so far), are not in your budget, then perhaps the more affordable Sony WH-CH720N could be. While they're not quite as premium, they're significantly cheaper and offer good enough quality for most people. You can get them for $97 (originally $179.99) on Amazon right now.\nThese are Sony's entry-level over-ear headphones, and Sony mostly made cuts in the design and build. When you hold them, they might feel hollow and light, but they're still comfortable since the earcups are well-cushioned, according to CNET's review. However, Sony did not make a lot of sacrifices in the audio or ANC department, which, at the end of the day, is what's most important. While they've dropped below $100 before, all three colorways have not been available at their current price at the same time—until now. These headphones use the same Sony Sound Connect app as the flagship models and share some of the same features, like multipoint technology to connect to up to two devices. They also come with Google Fast Pair and Find My Device support, nice features to have for convenience, and if you misplace them. You can get 35 hours of battery life with ANC on and 50 hours with ANC off, and the charging is quick, with three minutes giving you three hours of juice. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe ANC is not as good as the latest XM6, but it works great for under $100, according to Mashable's review and they'll block most ambient noise outdoors or indoors. Transparency mode is also great, allowing you to have conversations and hear bikes or cars passing by. The adjustable EQ in the app means you can tweak the crisp and vibrant sound of the WH-CH720N to your liking.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

On both Reddit and Google's own support forums, drivers now say their car icons are sporadically disappearing from their navigation screens while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. Some users have discovered workarounds, but the fixes don't appear to be consistent for everyone. Here's what's happening, and what you can do to try to fix it.The news first started popping up six days ago, on a Reddit thread where multiple users reported problems with their car icons disappearing while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. According to these drivers, when the bug was triggered, the map would move around normally, and traffic data and navigation instructions continued to display as expected. However, the icon indicating their car's position would suddenly disappear from their screen, making it difficult to know where exactly they were in comparison to the road. That's not ideal if you're trying to judge when your next turn is coming up.According to the thread's original poster, the issue popped up for them on the Android Auto version 16.1 release, although others mentioned the issue occurring as far back as version 15.9. The bug doesn't appear to happen all the time, but \"reliably\" appears when leaving Google Maps, opening another app in fullscreen, and either returning to Google Maps in fullscreen or pulling it up alongside the new app in a splitscreen view. To get their icon back, the original poster had to force quit Google Maps on their phone, but this wouldn't stop the bug from occurring again in the future. Google itself has not yet offered public comment on the issue, although I've reached out to the company and will update this post when I hear back.\nHow to fix Google Maps in Android Auto If you're encountering a disappearing car icon while using Google Maps through Android Auto, there are a few fixes that have worked for community members, although whether they'll work for everyone appears to be inconsistent.Try updating or downgrading your Android Auto versionThe timing of this bug appears to line up with the Android Auto v16.1 release, which launched last week. While the bug has been reported appearing on older versions of the app, like Android Auto v15.9, it could be worth trying out another version of Android Auto to see if it clears up the issue. For instance, one user mentioned that installing Android Auto V16.0.66 fixed the issue for them. If you're on an older version, you can update to a newest one from the Android Auto listing on the Play Store. If you're on a newest version and want to try an older one, though, you'll need to uninstall your Android Auto app and manually sideload the older version using a trusted APK file. Because these can be tricky to verify, this might not be the best option for most people.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTry changing your Android Auto car iconMultiple users in the original Reddit thread, including the original poster, pointed out that the bug only seems to affect them when using a non-default car icon. Until Google issues a fix, one solution might be to change your car icon back to the standard white arrow within a blue circle. To change your car icon in Google Maps, open the app on your phone while not connected to Android Auto. Start navigating to a location. Tap on your car icon, and swipe left or right to adjust the icon until you land on the default white arrow within a blue circle. The next time you connect your Google Maps app to Android Auto, your car's icon should be updated. Note that this isn't a guaranteed fix. One user on a Google support forum, for instance, said that their arrow icon also disappeared from Google Maps in Android Auto when returning from another app.Avoid triggering the bug, or use an alternative navigation appIf there is one saving grace to this bug, it's that the circumstances for triggering it seem to be pretty consistent. That means you can largely avoid it if you simply don't leave the Google Maps app once you open it. But while that might be OK for short trips, it's not ideal for longer ones, where you might want to adjust a podcast or playlist during your drive. You can manually restart your Google Maps app on your phone every time the bug pops up, but not only is that annoying, it's possibly dangerous if you're in the middle of a drive.If none of the above fixes work for you and you want to retain the ability to exit your fullscreen navigation app without losing your car icon, it might be worth putting Google Maps to bed for now and using an alternative navigation app. Google's own Waze app, for instance, works with Android Auto and does not seem to have this bug right now. Alternative navigation apps do have their own pros and cons, as Waze focuses less on comprehensive mapping and more on real-time crowdsourced traffic information when determining routes. However, it might be worth a shot. If Waze doesn't work for you, other popular navigation apps compatible with Android Auto include Sygic GPS and TomTom - Maps & Traffic (formerly TomTom AmiGo).\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends. You can follow Justin on Mastodon and Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter, Connectivity.\n        \n        \n            Areas of Expertise\n        \n        Read Full Bio\n    \n\n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        February 5, 2026\n                \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n    \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n    We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n            Credit: Sling\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        If you're like most people in 2026, you don't have cable and only miss it occasionally—mostly when there's a specific live sporting event taking place and you need a way to catch it. What if you could get cable for a single day, then ditch it? That's the basic idea behind Sling's 1 Day Pass. For $5, you can get  a day's access to ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, and a few more channels besides. That array will cover quite a few nationally broadcast sporting events.Unfortunately, like most everything related to watching live television in the age of streaming, this is more complicated than I'd like. A 1 Day Pass is only available for Sling Orange, which includes just a subset of Sling's overall offers. On top of that, Sling has always been a little bit confusing—an attribute it shares with the legacy cable companies still standing. But if you need one of the channels offered on Sling Orange, it's theoretically a good deal.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sling\n                    \n    \nGiven it's February, and you might be wondering whether you can use a 1 Day Pass to watch the Super Bowl without cable. Sadly, the answer is no: The big game is on NBC this year, and while Sling does offer NBC in a few markets, local channels aren't covered by Sling Orange The same goes for the winter Olympics, which will air on NBC and USA; you'll have to make a different plan to watch the Winter Games.\nBut March Madness is coming up too, and quite a few of those games are going to be available via a 1 Day Pass, so keep this service in mind if there's a single sporting event you want to watch, especially if you notice it's on ESPN, TBS, or TNT.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNow, could one argue that it's easier to install an ad blocker and search the internet for a pirated stream than it is to figure out how to legally watch something? Yes. Yes one could. But a Sling 1 Day Pass can save you from that temptation (not to mention accidentally downloading malware) for just $5.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Playlist transfers are now built into Spotify thanks to a new integration with TuneMyMusic, which facilitates music syncing, sharing, transfers, and backups across platforms. To initiate a playlist transfer from Apple Music or another streaming service (YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, etc.), open the Spotify mobile app and tap Your Library. Scroll to the bottom of the page, tap Import your music > Get Started, and follow the on-screen prompts to connect with TuneMyMusic. You can choose which platform to transfer music from, and your playlists will populate in Spotify. Your playlists will remain on the original platform, as they are simply being copied into Spotify. (This feature is currently rolling out to users, so you may need to update your Spotify app.)Data portability across music streamers has been very limited, but it's getting better: TuneMyMusic was already compatible with Spotify, but users had to sign up for a free trial with the service and were capped at just 500 songs before needing to upgrade to a paid plan. (Other third-party playlist transfer tools include FreeYourMusic and Soundiiz.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nApple Music has a music transfer feature built into its iOS and iPadOS (under Settings > Apps > Music) as well as the Apple Music app for Android and via the web. YouTube Music supports playlist imports and exports but requires a third-party service for platforms that don't permit direct transfers. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Opening your statement to see expensive charges you didn't make is stressful, and canceling your card—and dealing with all of your attached subscriptions—is a nightmare. So if you get a call about an unauthorized charge for a brand new iPhone, you're probably going to want to get to the bottom of it. Here's the thing: It's likely a scam. I speak from experience: My wife keeps getting calls from unknown numbers, all of which leave voicemails about charges for iPhones. The voicemail starts off with what sounds like standard holding music. Suddenly, a voice pops in, saying something to the affect of: \"This is Amazon. This call is to authorize the payment of $999 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 16 Pro on your account. If you do not authorize this payment, please press \"one\" to speak to our customer support representative.\" Your call may also be about, \"the payment of $1,099 for the recent order of Apple iPhone 17 Pro on your account.\" We are inundated with the calls, and besides the payment amount and the specific iPhone model, the rest of the message is identical. As you might expect, no such charges are actually present on either our Amazon account or in our credit card history. That's because no one bought an iPhone in our name, or by using our financial information: This was simply a scam.\nHad we answered the phone and pressed \"one\" to speak with a \"customer support representative,\" or called the number back after listening to the voicemail, this is what would have likely happened: The \"representative\" would have assured us that they would be able to dispute the charge, but of course they'd need some information from us first. Perhaps they would have needed us to confirm the credit card information, and would ask us to read our digits out loud. Maybe they'd need to make sure we actually owned the Amazon account in question, and would ask for our two-factor authentication code to \"confirm our identity.\" No matter what the case, the scammers would have been praying on our concern about the charge to extract some type of sensitive information from us, all for their own financial gain. Had we called back and complied, we would have almost assuredly handed the scammers the money we thought they were helping us get back.  What to do if you get this voicemailIf you get a voicemail like this, don't call them back. If you pick up the phone, and you get this message, don't press \"one;\" just hang up. You are definitely being scammed, and there's no risk in simply ignoring the caller completely. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you'd like to verify their claims, don't involve the caller at all. Instead, head to your Amazon account, and check your order history. You'll be able to see if any such iPhones were ordered under your account—and, if they were, you can cancel the order here. Similarly, check your credit card history: If you don't see a charge for an iPhone, there wasn't one. If you do see one, reach out to the credit card company directly through their official contact information.  Scammers rely on pressure tactics that stress you out, and make you feel like time is of the essence. It rarely ever is. While it might seem common practice for companies like Amazon to call customers about large charges, it really isn't. If you ever receive unsolicited communications from someone claiming to represent a company you belong to, you can always end the conversation, and reach out directly yourself. If you contact Amazon's official customer support, or the company that issues your credit card, they'll be able to confirm or deny the claim for you.  While you can block the number, it might not do much good. Each time we've received a call, it's been from a different number, so my guess is they're not reusing numbers when calling you back. Instead, you should strongly consider using one of Apple's built-in anti-spam tools. If you're running iOS 26, you can choose to have your iPhone screen calls from unknown numbers, and ask for information before sending the call your way. No matter which version of iOS you have, you can also choose to silence unknown callers en masse, so you're never interrupted by any caller that isn't in your contacts. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We'll keep you updated with all the best deals throughout the holiday shopping season. But before you purchase anything, here's how to set your own prices for Black Friday and every other day. If you're an impulse buyer, you know that shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday can be bad. Even though we know retailers are using all kinds of manipulation techniques to get us to buy things we don’t need, it still works, so this year, try setting your own prices and only choosing things you already want to buy.How to “set your own prices” on AmazonYou can’t make Amazon lower its prices at your whim, but you can set up an alert system to let you know if anything you want to buy dips in price enough for it to make sense for you to purchase it. Below is a step-by-step guide to setting your own personal maximum price for any item sold by Amazon:Identify the items you’d like to purchase and throw them into your Amazon wishlist. Make sure your wishlist is set to “public.”Visit the Amazon price-tracking website CamelCamelCamel and make a free account. There are other price-tracking apps and websites that, more or less, do the same thing—Slick Deals, Honey, Keepa, etc.—so check out this overview of the best price-tracking tools if you want to compare them. Spoiler alert, though: For Amazon specifically, camelCamelCamel wins.Click “import wishlist.” (You’ll have to copy and paste the URL from your Amazon wishlist.)Once you’ve done that, CamelCamelCamel lets you add specific maximum prices (or percentage drops) for everything in your wishlist. Enter the maximum amount you’re willing to pay for each item in your list, and then you can tell it to send you an email when any item’s price drops to your set spending limit.Ignore all the hype and wait for the email alert letting you know that your chosen items have become cheap enough for you to buy.Spend Black Friday feeling smug and agree with yourself that you actually are the smartest person alive. Don’t even look at Amazon’s website. Seriously. Well, maybe just for a second. This time you’ll have the willpower to avoid buying another chocolate fountain or a self-stirring mug with “SELF STIRRING MUG” written on the side, right? Right?How to set price alerts at non-Amazon retailersCamelaCamelCamel is an Amazon-only product, but other price-tracking services can be used with other retailers. Honey, for instance, is PayPal's retail service. It lists 10,000 supported retailers. If you install the Honey browser extension, you can add an item you want to buy from a retailer to your droplist and it will notify you when the price drops to the level you set. You can also compare the price of the same item across website. Here's how to set your own price:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCreate an account with Honey.Install the Honey browser extension. Find the item you want to buy on Honey's website.Click the \"Add to Droplist\" button that appears on the product page.Set the discount percentage you want to see.  Click \"Add to Droplist\" to confirm your preferences. Honey will then monitor the item and send you an email or push notification once the price drops to the amount you specified. More ideas for imposing limits on your spendingIf you want to take tech-based shopping guardrails beyond the basic \"time to buy\" alert system described above, here are some ideas.Block ads: If you're the type of person who responds to online ads, you can block a ton of them with a simple tool or app. Here's our overview of the best ad-blocking software. Track your expenses: Whether you do it with pencil and paper or use an app, seeing how much you're spending can be a powerful motivation to be more thrifty. Budgeting over time can even give you a bit of a surplus, so you can splurge when Black Friday rolls around if you want to.Save up for something: Saving up for something in the future—a vacation, an electric surfboard, whatever—can make it easier to resist spending now.Hit your internal pause button: If you can make a habit of waiting a day or two between thinking \"I want those sunglasses\" and entering your credit card numbers, you may decide your old sunglasses are just fine.Set up a one-in-one-out system: For everything you buy or acquire, get rid of a similar item (or more!) to make room for it. Knowing something has to go if you hit \"buy now\" can stop you from making an impulse buy, and following this rule keeps your home less cluttered. Bonus points if you resell an item before getting a similar one. Make money before spending money, and save space while you're at it.Consider professional help: It's normal and common to sometimes have a little difficulty controlling spending, but researchers say about 6% of Americans suffer from compulsive buying disorder which may be part of a larger psychological problem. So if your spending is driving you deep into debt, you're suffering real-world consequences based on your buying habits, or you just feel like shopping might be a problem for you, talk to a professional. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Early Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

If you all have Androids, you might use Quick Share. But if you have a mix of both platforms, suddenly file sharing isn't so easy. You could email the pictures, but, shoot, there's a data limit. You could text them, but if your friend isn't on RCS, videos are going to look horrible. You could use a cross-platform chat app, but good luck agreeing on which one to use. If only AirDrop was available on Android, and Quick Share on iOS.In a Thursday announcement on The Keyword, Google made history: Quick Share now works with AirDrop—starting with the Pixel 10, anyway. If you or a friend has one of Google's latest smartphones, you can start wirelessly file sharing to the other platform, as if they were a part of yours. To that point, it does seem like file sharing between iPhone and Android—and vice versa—feels intuitive. On Android, you can open Quick Share, look at your \"Send to nearby devices,\" and a compatible iPhone will appear alongside any compatible Android devices. On iOS, opening AirDrop will show a compatible Pixel 10 among the list of available devices. It's almost like the features were built this way from the beginning. (They should have been.)\nThe only caveat is the receiver's iPhone needs to be set to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" If the iPhone is set to \"Contacts Only,\" this feature won't work yet. Google says it's open to working with Apple to expand this functionality, but at the moment, you can't leave your AirDrop open to just your contacts, if those contacts happen to be on Pixel.   \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's too bad this new cross-platform functionality is limited to the Pixel 10 series, but, hopefully, it expands to more Androids over time. While iOS and Android aren't necessarily the easiest operating systems to work across, Apple and Google have made massive improvements in recent years. Now that iPhones support RCS, and some Androids now work with AirDrop, we're closing the gap between these two once-polar-opposite platforms.      \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Google, the company that makes more money from advertising than any other on Earth, is actively working to make ad blockers worse on Chrome while it also makes it harder to block ads on YouTube. Basically, it's a good time to not use Chrome.So it's nice that Apple users have another choice: Safari. And, as luck would have it, Safari has an extremely efficient API for ad blocking built right in. The ad blocker wBlock uses this, and the result is ads are blocked in a way that doesn't slow down your browsing.\nI wrote a few months ago about uBlock Origin for Safari, which doesn't use Apple's native blocking feature. I enjoyed how effective that application was at blocking ads, but over time I've found it does impact the performance of my browser a little. After setting up wBlock, everything feels snappy.You can install wBlock from the App Store on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. After doing so, you can choose which filter lists you want to use. Several are offered, or you can just stick with the defaults.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nYou will also be asked if you want to enable any userscripts. The ones offered bring back YouTube's old interface and bypass paywalls. You can also install custom userscripts, if you want, meaning you won't need a separate application for that functionality.After that, you'll need to open Safari, head to the settings, and turn on all the wBlock entries you see on the extensions page. Do that and you should be able to browse the web without any ads.If you're curious about how this extension works and how it compares to other Safari ad blockers, I recommend checking out the documentation on Github—it goes over how this tool works and how it differs from other applications. I also encourage you to think about the pros and cons of blocking ads overall.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Popular sites like X and ChatGPT were unresponsive, returning error messages rather than their usual homepages. The culprit? A massive Cloudflare outage.The upside is that the outage appears to be ending. Cloudflare says it has identified the problem and issued a fix, so affected websites should be coming back online this morning. But that doesn't change the fact that so many websites went dark today, all because one company experienced unexplained downtime. How is it that a Cloudflare outage can seemingly break the internet? What is Cloudflare?Cloudflare offers a number of products for sites and services with the goals of improving traffic performance and reliability, as well as cybersecurity. A company like Cloudflare spreads its network out throughout the globe, so that when users try to visit a website, the server they ping is the one closest to them. Rather than all users attempting to visit your server at once, they go through their Cloudflare server local. \nThis serves two main purposes: First, it limits the demand on your site. If all users were trying to ping your server at once, it puts a strain on your network, and could either slow things down or shut them down completely. Routing users to the Cloudflare server closest to them spreads out the demand, and reduces the risk of interruption. In addition, users are less likely to experience delays in physical distance to your network: If you're based in Japan, and your user is based in New York, it's going to take them longer to reach your server than it would a user from South Korea. However, if that New York user instead connects to a Cloudflare server closest to them, they can access your data much more quickly. Why does Cloudflare affect so many websites?Cloudflare's goal is to improve the experience for users around the world to visit international websites—so why does it seem like half the internet went dark when Cloudflare experienced an outage?\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reason is because so many websites use Cloudflares services. According to Backlinko, over 24 million websites actively rely on Cloudflare in some capacity. That includes over 4,300 of the 10,000 \"most popular\" websites around the world. The U.S. alone has nearly 2,470,000 million websites relying on Cloudflare, while the UK has almost 780,000. Many other countries, like Brazil, Germany, Russia, Australia, Canada, China, India, and France, each have hundreds of thousands of websites running on Cloudflare.There are over one billion websites out there in the world, which means a total Cloudflare outage would account for roughly 2% of global websites' connectivity issues. However, if Backlinko's stats are correct, a huge percentage of popular websites rely on Cloudflare. Sure, the vast majority of websites may remain unaffected by this outage, but nearly half of the sites people most often visit have problems here. If you primarily visit U.S. websites, that number may be even higher. It's a similar reason why an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage takes down so many websites. AWS provides cloud computing services for so many companies and websites, that when issues pop-up, you experience problems with your favorite websites. It poses a logistical question for how the global internet currently works: Yes, it's great that services like Cloudflare make it possible to reliably access international websites as if they were within your region—but if too much of the internet leans on it, is it really all that reliable?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

If you installed the application, you could search the files on your computer the same way you could search the web. The application made finding your own documents quick—as a small town reporter in northern Alberta, I constantly used this service to dig through my old notes and previous articles.The service was shut down in 2011, announced via a blog post, which stated that the feature was no longer necessary in the cloud storage era. And that was the end of Google offering to search files on your computer—until now. Back in September, Google announced an experimental Windows-only application named \"Google App for Windows\" that, among other things, searches the files on your computer.Nostalgic person that I am, I couldn't help but wonder: was this going to be similar to the retro offering? So I gave it a shot. The installation requires opting in to an \"experiment\" using your Google account, then downloading and installing an application. After that, you can bring up a search by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Space, which brings up a search bar. You can use this to search for files on your computer, your Google Drive, and information on the web.\nThe actual file search doesn't seem particularly sophisticated. While the retro Google Desktop could search the contents of files, the Google App for Windows seems to mostly only be aware of file names. That's disappointing—I liked being able to figure out which files I mentioned particular names, or try to find the source of a sentence I remember writing. This local search functionality honestly isn't much better than the search that comes with Windows.What this new app can do, though, is search your Google Drive. I was able to quickly find and open files I'd created in Google Docs, then open them in one click. The ability to search these cloud docs alongside my local ones in one place is a decent reason to give this application a chance.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nAnd there are also a few web-based features. If there are no files that match your search, you'll see Google search results—select any of those and you'll see an AI-generated blurb answering your question. If you'd prefer traditional Google search results, you can get those instead—just turn off \"AI mode\" by clicking your profile picture and turning off the AI Mode toggle.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFinally, this application can be used to take a screenshot of your computer and answer questions related to it. For example, I took a snap of my desktop wallpaper—a photo my wife took in New Zealand—and got an accurate description of the location.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe feature is similar to those offered by the desktop application of ChatGPT and Claude, just powered by Google's AI instead of those tools. I'm not sure I'd find myself using this regularly, but it's an interesting idea.The Google App for Windows, sadly, isn't a resurrection of the long-dead Google Desktop, but it is an interesting tool that combines a simple local file search with results from your Google Drive and the web. It's worth playing around with if you're a dedicated Google user who still stores a lot of files on their computer.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

When I tried to load sites like X, ChatGPT, or, ironically, Downdetector, I was met with various errors. X showed me an internal service error, while Downdetector asked me to \"Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.\" (I definitely do not have that authority.) You may experience similar errors on websites you try to load this morning, even ones you don't regularly visit. As part of this article, for example, I would google queries and click the top results to websites I had never heard of before, only to encounter similar error messages. That's because a large portion of the global internet relies on Cloudflare to operate. Cloudflare offers a host of services to companies, including web infrastructure and cybersecurity products. As such, when Cloudflare goes down, so do many of those websites—a bit of a domino effect.\nIt's not clear at this time what brought on the outage, but, as spotted by Techradar, Cloudflare had announced scheduled maintenance for some of its web servers for Nov. 18, ranging from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. UTC (7am to 10am ET), so it's possible something happened during this work to break service. The good news is, it appears that many of these sites are back up and running—at least, at this time. At 8:09 a.m. ET, Cloudflare reported it had identified the issue, and was working on a fix. At 9:42 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it rolled out the fix, and that the company believes the incident is resolved—though the official status page still says the Cloudflare Global Network is experiencing issues. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile this is indeed a big interruption to the internet, it's far from the first time this has happened. In fact, an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage broke the internet last month. With the Cloudflare outage this morning, it's an example of the risks of so many companies putting their web services needs in the same basket: If one servicer goes, so too goes a huge fraction of the web. Cloudflare will likely patch this issue sometime Tuesday, so I imagine we'll all be back to business as usual soon enough. I'll keep this article updated with developments as they come. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That means scammers are also busy contacting people, impersonating insurance providers in an effort to collect personal, financial, and medical information.Fraudsters especially love to impersonate representatives from Medicare, targeting older adults and others who qualify for the federal program with unexpected calls. As the Federal Trade Commission warns, scammers may have some of your personal information already and will ask you to confirm your Medicare, bank account, and/or credit card number under the guise of sending you a new Medicare card. In reality, Medicare cards are free and sent automatically, so you should never need to provide payment. Scammers may also target consumers on Marketplace, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans with a similar tactic, claiming that you may lose or be disqualified from health coverage unless you make a payment. \nIn addition to impersonating government officials, bad actors will pretend to represent a legitimate insurer, promising discounted plans (that are available only for a limited time) or enrollment assistance (for a fee). Plans that seem too good to be true probably aren't health insurance at all and may not provide the coverage promised. And you shouldn't have to pay anyone to sign up for a plan.  Note that while scammers may ramp up efforts during open enrollment, health insurance scams can happen year-round. A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) advisory warns consumers about common tactics like calls and texts in which scammers—impersonating government agencies or insurance companies—offer health screening, free gifts, or other promotional benefits in exchange for your personal information. Bad actors can pretty easily spoof phone numbers (so it looks like you're getting a call from a reputable insurance provider like Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield) as well as set up phishing websites designed to steal your credentials and financial information. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInsurance scam red flagsAs always, unsolicited communication that pressures you to take action is almost always a scam. Medicare representatives will never call, email, or text you to verify information or demand payment, nor will legitimate government officials try to sell you anything or threaten you unless you pay up. If someone claims they represent an insurer and asks for money or sensitive personal information, or if they threaten you with legal action, hang up. Don't share any data, including your social security number, bank account number, or medical history with anyone—that is, unless you have contacted the Medicare office or other legitimate agency directly and first and need to verify your identity. (The number for Medicare is 1-800-MEDICARE, and you can reach a Marketplace representative through HealthCare.gov). Always verify a representative's identity using official contact information found on a .gov website, legitimate company page, or an account statement, and never send money via gift card, prepaid debit, or crytocurrency in exchange for anything. You should also ensure your credentials for your insurance accounts (like HealthCare.gov and Medicare.gov) are strong and secure, and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

If you tried to follow your feeds on X, or engage with ChatGPT, you were only met with error messages. Compare those error messages to one another, however, and you'd likely notice a similar name affixed to them all: Cloudflare. Cloudflare's massive Tuesday morning outage had sweeping implications for much of the web. While it's not clear what caused the outage at this time, we do know whether the outage was responsible for a website's downtime. (When an error page says \"Cloudflare: Error,\" it's not difficult to track down the source of the problem.) As Cloudflare offers web infrastructure services to a huge number of sites, the true list of affected sites is likely massive. As an example, I wanted to convert the timezone Cloudflare uses in its status reports, UTC, to ET, and the first website I clicked on in my Google search returned an error. While there's no central repository listing each and every affected website, we can look at the sites with the largest number of user reports indicating issues this morning through Downdetector. (Disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Lifehacker.) Ironically, Downdetector itself was down this morning—it too uses Cloudflare.\nDowndetector is not a service that investigates and reports websites that are down. Instead, users can self-report issues with sites on Downdetector. As such, it can be illuminating to see which sites visitors were having issues with during the period of time Cloudflare was down. At this time, that includes the following:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nXCloudflareOpenAIChatGPTGrindrArchive of Our OwnAWSSpotifyLeague of LegendseClinicalWorksQuizletUberCharacter.aiCanvaClaudeVaroIndeedProcoreTruth SocialFanFictionArloDoorDashValorantRunescapeDayforceNJTransitSniffiesSquareGoogleZoomRoverCollegeBoardLetterboxd  Bet365MoneyLionDayZBetMGMYouTubeMicrosoftIKEASunoMicrosoft 365Canvas by InstructureMicrosoft TeamsAmazonGrokInstagramGeminiAgain, this list is not definitive, nor is it official.

I know I have done a poor job of keeping track of media as I have upgraded computers and phones over the years, and I've lost my fair share of photos, videos, and documents along the way, whether on misplaced or damaged external drives or from simply forgetting to back up at all. Here's how to ensure your data is available for years to come. \nYou need multiple backups of your dataOne approach to backing up your data is the 3-2-1 strategy, which says you should keep three copies of your data across two different forms of storage, one of which should be offsite (in case a disaster strikes your home). A simple example: You have your photos and files on your computer, which is backed up regularly to both an external hard drive and a cloud service. That's three copies of your data on two storage types—an onsite physical device and remote cloud storage—the latter of which satisfies the \"offsite\" requirement because it is geographically separate from your other two copies. This approach protects against a single point of failure, such as a primary device dying, losing an external hard drive, or getting locked out of a cloud account. When it comes to backing up your data, redundancy matters. As Reddit users note, there are different interpretations of how to apply the 3-2-1 rule, such as whether your working copy on your primary device counts as one of three and whether the one offsite copy is included in the two forms of storage. And while a strict 3-2-1 strategy, or variations of it, may be more commonly employed at the enterprise level rather than by the average consumer, you could think about it as a general guideline for improving your backup system, especially if you don't have one at all. How to set up backupsYou never know when a device might fail, so it's a good idea to plan frequent backups, whether your data is syncing regularly to the cloud or you set reminders to manually push updates to your external hard drive. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMany users sync their devices automatically to a service like iCloud or Google Drive, but relying on this as your sole backup doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to access all of your files in the future. As HowtoGeek points out, these backups are typically mirroring what's currently on your device rather than historical versions—so once you delete a photo, file, or folder from your computer or phone, it's also deleted from the cloud backup. This is useful for quick access as well as restoring to a new or factory-reset device, but it doesn't do much for the scores of media collected over the years that you don't use daily. You could use a dedicated cloud backup service like IDrive or Backblaze, which come with a lot of storage space for automatic, full device backups. This may be best for users who have large files or a lot of media that is essential to their jobs as well as those who prioritize data privacy. (However, Wirecutter notes that most online backup services leave a lot to be desired.) Others may be fine to manually move files and media to free or low-cost cloud storage, including iCloud, OneDrive, and Google. At a minimum, another backup should live on an external hard drive—and if you're not going to do cloud backups, consider two external drives stored in separate locations. Hardware can obviously be lost, stolen, damaged, or simply degraded over time, so again, you shouldn't rely on a single drive for all of your storage. Apple's Time Machine and Windows File History make it easy to save backups to an external drive. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In its November fraud and scam advisory, Google is warning users about VPN apps and extensions that appear legitimate but are actually vectors for malware.VPNs may actually be spyware A VPN, or virtual private network, makes your internet activity much more difficult to track by routing your traffic through a different connection rather than your regular internet service provider (ISP). This allows you to hide your IP address and location, obscure your browsing data, and protect your information and devices from bad actors. According to Google, malicious VPNs (posing as real ones) are delivering infostealers, remote access trojans, and banking trojans to user devices once installed, allowing hackers to access sensitive personal data like browsing history, financial credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet information. This means that an app you rely on to keep your information private could be doing the exact opposite. Cybercriminals are capitalizing on user trust in these services, creating apps that look and feel like legitimate VPNs but are actually dangerous spyware. \nHow to ensure your VPN app is safeAs with any app or extension, only download or install a VPN from an official source like the Google Play store. While malicious programs do sometimes sneak through, it's typically safer and more reliable than sideloading through a messaging app or other unvetted site. In January 2025, Google launched a VPN verification process to help users identify trustworthy VPN apps in the Google Play store. To earn a \"verified\" badge, VPN apps have to undergo a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation and opt into independent security reviews. Badges are awarded only to VPNs that have been published for at least 90 days and reach 10,000 installs and 250 user reviews. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, this system isn't perfect either: As TechRadar reported earlier this year, a popular (free) Chrome VPN extension earned a badge and was later discovered to be spying on users. That's why you should rely on a reputable VPN service—which means you'll likely have to pay for it. Free VPNs are far more likely to a privacy nightmare, and any app that sounds too good to be true probably is. You aren't going to get unlimited traffic at no cost without sacrificing something. Finally, review VPN permissions carefully, and allow the minimum access possible for the app or extension to function. (You should do this with any app you download, and you should audit apps regularly to remove unnecessary permissions.) You can check your VPN service's support pages to find out which permissions are essential—this should not include access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or photos, for example. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The app picks up on your interests quickly, and before you know it, you're falling down an hours-deep rabbit hole every time you launch it. But the algorithm doesn't always get it right: Sometimes, you end up seeing too much of one type of content, no matter how many times you hit \"Not Interested.\" With the rise of AI-generated content, this problem only gets more frustrating. AI video generators like Sora are empowering people to produce more hyperrealistic AI slop than ever, which means you've likely encountered it on your feeds—whether you know it or not. I've certainly laughed at some AI clips here and there, but for the most part, I can't stand coming across them in the wild. And they aren't just a nuisance, they can be legitimately dangerous—some have even tricked users into installing malware on their smartphones. As this content become more normalized, I worry for our collective ability to spot misinformation across our social media platforms, so whenever you can take a step to reducing or removing this content from your feeds, I encourage you to do so.  \nAnd as it happens, TikTok is now experimenting with a tool to help you control the AI slop on your For You Page. Per a Wednesday press release, the company says it will roll out the new option in the existing \"Manage topics\" menu of the app's settings page. Manage topics already lets you finely tune parts of your individual TikTok algorithm to show you more of one subject or less of another—you can manage things like creative arts, current affairs, dance, fashion and beauty, food and drinks, health and fitness, humor, lifestyle, nature, pets, sports, travel. Soon, the section will add a slider for AI-generated content as well, if the option isn't live for you already. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to limit AI slop in TikTokTikTok says this new option is rolling out \"in the coming weeks,\" which is unfortunately vague. I don't have the option, even after installing the latest version of TikTok. However, that also means it could hit your app at any time. When it does, here's how to use it:Open TikTok, then tap \"Profile\" in the bottom right.Tap the hamburger menu icon in the top right, then choose \"Settings and privacy.\" Under \"Content & Display,\" choose \"Content preferences,\" then choose \"Manage topics.\"When the option is available on your app, adjust the \"AI-generated content\" slider. Move it left to see less AI-generated content, or move it right to see more of this content. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to completely remove AI content from your TikTok feed. Hopefully with this slider in place, however, you'll greatly reduce the amount of AI content you see, to the point where it's effectively gone entirely. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

All that surrounding noise can make it difficult to stick to the task at hand, and actually get some solid work done.I enjoy browsing social media and exploring the web as much as the next person, but I've also got plenty of writing to get through every day, and distractions can seriously slow me down. Studies have shown that we do much better when we focus on one task at a time, which for me is writing guides and articles.While distraction-free devices such as the Freewrite Smart Typewriter have always appealed, I wanted to be more focused while using my MacBook Air. To that end, I've come up with a strategy for minimizing distractions as much as possible, and it's something you might find helpful for your own work.\nThese steps apply specifically to macOS and Google Docs, which is what I use for most of my writing, but you can adapt them for Windows and other word processors too.Turn off notifications\n    \n            \n            Focus modes are an easy way to manage notifications.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNotifications is a good place to start—if your laptop is continually pinging and alerting you to other things, it's hard to get anything done. On macOS, notification settings can be handled by clicking the Apple icon (top left), then System Settings > Notifications. Here you can set alerts on an app-by-app basis.For me, the Focus entry in System Settings is even more useful. Here I've set up a dedicated Work focus mode that blocks all notifications from all apps, and leaves me in peace. To create your own mode, click Add Focus on the main list—you can either set them to run on a schedule, or enable them manually via Focus in the Control Center (click the toggle switches on the menu bar, top right, to access them).For the best results, you need to silence your phone as well, which is likely to be interrupting you even more than your laptop. If you're using an iPhone, you can sync Focus modes across both macOS and iOS, by enabling the Share across devices toggle switch on the main Focus options screen.Tweak your writing software\n    \n            \n            Google Docs has a few tricks for distraction-free writing.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nEven without notifications enabled, it's easy to catch sight of something else you could be doing on your laptop, rather than concentrating on a single task. Explore the various options available within your word processor of choice to make the interface as minimal as possible—which in my case involves tweaking the look of Google Docs.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nTo get the same effect on your own Google Docs documents, first head to the View menu and make sure the ruler, equation toolbar, and spelling and grammar suggestions are all hidden (for me, they just add to the on-screen clutter). Then, open the Format menu and choose Switch to pageless format to get one long, flowing page.Next, select View and pick Full screen, and then maximize the browser window in macOS using the green button up in the top left corner. Hey presto—all you've got on screen now are your words, with nothing else to distract you. To bring back the Google Docs menus and toolbars, press Esc to exit maximized mode, move the cursor to the top of the screen and click the green button again.Turn off the internet\n    \n            \n            Turn off wifi to reduce distractions further.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nFor the most extreme version of a distraction-free writing device—heading back to the days of the typewriter—I block internet access on my laptop too (on macOS, you can just click the wifi symbol on the menu bar, top right, then toggle off Wi-Fi). Sure, it's not the most comprehensive way of blocking the internet, but it works for me, and makes me think twice about going online (yes, Google Docs can work offline).I find it makes me less likely to check the news, social media, or email when I should be writing. The obvious problem is that I can't look up anything online either, so it's a bit of a soft rule I have—I try to at least write certain chunks of articles while offline, then do all my online research at once, and without opening dozens of browser tabs.You can tailor this to suit yourself, but I've found switching off the internet makes me more likely to rely on my own thoughts and word choices—without recourse to a dictionary or thesaurus. Sometimes it's good to give your brain a bit of exercise, and get it to slow down and focus for a while.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Now click the View button in the menu bar up top, and select Use Dark Appearance for PDF.\nInsert pages in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview lets you easily add pages to a PDF file. You can either add a blank page or insert a page from a different file. To use this feature, open a PDF file in Preview, and go to Edit > Insert. You can either choose Blank Page or Page from File….The option to insert a blank page in the PDF is self-explanatory. If you want to insert a page from a different file, there are different ways to do so. The option in the Edit menu will directly insert the whole PDF or image file you select into your PDF. This is fine when you're selecting a single-page PDF that needs to go into a bigger file, but it's not ideal if you want to add just one page from a 50-page document. If you're trying to do this, add pages by opening two PDF files side-by-side in Preview, and dragging pages from the first to the second PDF file. If the sidebar is hidden in Preview, go to View > Thumbnails. You can now drag the thumbnail from one sidebar to another with ease.Reorder pages in a PDF \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nIf you want to change the order of pages in a PDF file in Preview, just drag and rearrange the thumbnails in the sidebar. It's quite smooth and intuitive, and you'll be able to get the job done pretty quickly.Delete pages from a PDF file \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nPreview has a page deletion feature built in, too. Once again, just open a PDF file in Preview, select any page in the sidebar, and press the Delete button to remove the page from your PDF document. This option is also available under Edit > Delete.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnnotate, edit, and redact text in a PDF file\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use basic markup tools to add, select, edit, and redact text in Preview. These tools, along with the options to annotate and sign PDFs, are all available under the Markup Toolbar in Preview for Mac. To access these tools, open any PDF in Preview, and click the pencil icon in the toolbar. Alternatively, you can go to View > Show Markup Toolbar. These tools are more than sufficient for quick edits to PDF documents.Add a PDF password\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can use Preview to add a password to a PDF file, or to remove passwords from a file. To add a password to the PDF file you're viewing in Preview, go to File > Edit Permissions, and check the box labelled Require Password to Open Document. Once you've added and confirmed the password, you'll also have to add an owner password to the document. The owner password lets you restrict others from making changes to the PDF file, printing it, etc. Ideally, it should be different from the password used to open the PDF file. With both passwords added, click Apply to confirm the changes.Rotate pages in a PDF\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nSometimes, PDF files arrive with an unusable orientation—e.g., portrait pages scanned in landscape mode. In such cases, you can use Preview to rotate the pages of a PDF. Just go to the page you want to rotate and press Command-L to rotate it left or Command-R to rotate right. Fun fact: You can also do the same thing using your trackpad. Use two fingers to mimic a rotating motion and you'll see that the page of the PDF file rotates to the left or the right.These options are also available under the Tools menu. Over there, you'll also find options to flip a page horizontally or vertically, as well as a feature that removes the background from a PDF page.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

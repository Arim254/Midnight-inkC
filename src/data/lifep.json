I've been on the app for something like 15 years now, and during this time, I've learned a trick or two that improve the experience (or at least make it less annoying). Here are 10 Instagram hacks that will enhance your privacy, reduce the amount of junk in your feed, help you reset your algorithm, and more.On every social media app, I like to set up filters to mute offensive keywords, but you can use keywords to block almost anything you don't want to see. On Instagram, you can use filters to easily block spammy comments and offensive messages. While you can customize your filter list, I just looked up a list of offensive phrases, and quickly added it to my IG account, then added a few additional terms.You can do the same thing by going to your Instagram profile page, and tapping the three-lines menu in the top-right corner in Instagram. This opens the Settings and activity page, where you can select Hidden Words. It lets you add multiple words, as long as you separate them with a comma. Once added, Instagram will block comments and messages containing those terms.You can also add mute keywords for posts appearing in your feed. Go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Specific words and phrases. On the Content preferences page, go to Sensitive content and Political content, and you can limit those types of posts and videos from showing up on your feed too.Reset your Instagram algorithmEvery once in a while, my Instagram algorithm goes haywire and I'm forced to reset it. After all, I mostly open this app to see my friends' updates and cat videos, and once my feed starts showing me too much Hyrox content (a \"sport\" I couldn't care less about), I know I'm in trouble. If something like this happens to you, there are two ways to reprogram your feed. The easy option is to just look for a reel you enjoy (such as a cat video), and swipe upwards a few times till you reach a non-cat video, then navigate away. Repeat this process a few times and your feed will be back to more cat videos and less Hyrox (or anything else).If that doesn't work, or if your feed is too far gone in the wrong direction, then you can go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Reset suggested content to reboot it entirely.Remove tracking links from InstagramWhen you share any post, reel, story, or other type of content on Instagram, the app tracks who you're sharing it with, even if you send the link outside Instagram. You can see this by tapping the Share button on any post, and selecting Copy link: Paste this link in any text editor, such as Apple Notes or Google Keep, and you'll see that the link has tracking parameters at the end, such as \"?igsh=…\" or \"?utm…\". That helps Instagram identify that you've shared the link.There's no way to disable this tracking, but you can manually remove it from each link before you send it to someone. Just paste the URL it as usual, then delete everything after the question mark.Force Instagram to open DM links in your preferred browser\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nWhenever you open a link in Instagram, the app opens it in an in-app browser. This is the least privacy friendly option, as Instagram can then track which websites you're visiting quite easily. You can partially stop this by tapping the three-dots button in the top-right corner of Instagram's in-app browser and selecting Open in external browser.There's no way to make this the default setting for all links, but you can set it as default for links you receive via DM. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > App website permissions > Message links and turn on Open in external browser.Limit your Instagram notificationsAfter you post something, Instagram loves to spam you with notifications every time a few people interact with the post. Even if you don't use Instagram for a day or two, you'll still get a deluge of notifications from the app. I don't face this problem because I never allow Instagram permission to send any notifications on my devices, but that's not an option for everyone. If you don't want to turn off notifications entire, you can choose to receive only the useful notifications from Instagram. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > Notifications and review all the options available to you. I particularly like the Messages only option, which only sends me an alert when someone DMs viaon the app.To further limit notifications, go to the Following and followers section on this page, and disable Account suggestions. Similarly, you can go to Messages and disable Message reminders and all varieties of channel notification settings. You can also go to the Calls section and turn off Video chats, which has the added bonus of disabling video calls on Instagram, which I've never wanted to use.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHide your online status and disable read receipts on InstagramFor some reason, Instagram shows other people when you're online. If you want to be more discreet, go to Instagram Settings > Messages and story replies > Show activity status and turn the setting off. (On the previous page, you can select Show read receipts and turn it off to stop people seeing if you've read their messages too.)Hide the \"typing\" indicator in Instagram messagesWhen someone is messaging you on Instagram, the app shows you an animation to tell you that the other person is typing. More often than not, this feature only makes me keep the app open longer while the other person types their message, which is probably why Instagram's added it in the first place. If you don't want to see the typing indicator in a chat, you can disable it: Open any chat in Instagram and tap the contact's name up top. Go to Privacy and safety and turn off Typing indicator. Sadly, you'll need to do this manually for each of your Instagram chats.Enable end-to-end encryption to make Instagram more secure\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nInstagram chats are not encrypted by default, which means that the company can read all your messages. If you want to beef up your security, consider using end-to-end encryption for your chats. Just like Telegram, Instagram hides its end-to-end encrypted chat feature, and makes you enable it manually for each chat. You can do so by opening any chat in Instagram, tapping the contact's name up top, selecting Privacy and safety > Use end-to-end encryption.Automatically clear your Instagram search historyYour Instagram search history shows up whenever you try to search for anything on Instagram. This can be embarrassing if you've looked up something really silly (or slightly naughty), and someone else sees it. to prevent this, you can clear your searches by tapping the search bar in Instagram, and selecting Clear all, or tapping the x next to each search term. However, there's also a way to automatically clear your search history on Instagram: Go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Your information and permissions > Search history > Keep searches for, and select 3 days, which is the minimum time for automatically deleting your searches.There's no way to block ads on Instagram, but you can reduce the amount of your data that Instagram uses to show you those ads. Just go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Ad preferences > Manage info. You can go through each option on this page and turn off everything you can. Under Categories used to reach you, select Remove on every option.You can choose Don't allow us… in these two categories: Ads in other apps and Ads about Meta. Finally, you can select Activity information from ad partners > Review setting, and pick No, don't make my ads more relevant.\n            \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                Pranay Parab\n                                Pranay Parab is an independent tech journalist based in Mumbai, India.

Alexa+ is like the old Alexa, but with new contextual abilities. Users can ask complex, multipart questions, as well as requests for tasks, like asking Alexa to book you concert tickets. If you've used a voice mode on chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, you're familiar with the concept—it's just now available on your Echo devices, too. Now, Amazon is letting you lightly customize the personality of your new AI assistant, offering the choice between concise, calm, and enthusiastic bots. On Wednesday, Amazon announced \"Alexa+ personality styles,\" a new feature that lets you customize how Alexa responds to queries and requests. At launch, Amazon is rolling out three styles for this experience: \"Brief,\" \"Chill,\" and \"Sweet.\" According to Amazon, Brief is the choice for users who want shorter responses that are more direct and to the point. There should be less flowery language that chatbots are known for, including small talk and \"extra conversation.\" Chill, on the other hand, aims to be an \"easygoing and \"relaxed\" personality, that emulates \"chatting with a laid-back friend.\" Amazon says users who add the Chill personality to Alexa+ will notice conversations are \"breezy,\" and Alexa+ should offer \"gentle guidance\" with requests. Sweet is your \"biggest cheerleader\": Amazon says this bot responds with warmth and enthusiasm, celebrating your successes, encouraging you, and transforming \"everyday moments into opportunities for positivity.\" (I just wanted to know the weather, Alexa.)You can hear a sample of each personality on Amazon's official announcement page, or use the embeds below. Amazon has uploaded Soundcloud links with a brief for each, so you can get a sense of the voice and style of all three. First, there's Brief, which just says, \"Operating efficiently\":\nNext, is Chill, which says, \"Life's treating me well. All systems are zen, and the digital universe is spinning in harmony\":\nFinally, there's Sweet, which says, \"Absolutely fantastic. I'm radiating pure joy, and ready to make your day incredibly amazing\":\nAmazon says each of these voices was created following five pillars: Expressiveness, which can be concise to verbose; Emotional Openness, which can be reserved to enthusiastic; Formality, which can be professional to casual; Directness, which can be diplomatic to blunt; and Humor, which can range from subtle wit to overt sarcasm. Each pillar has its own ranges, which informs each personality. For example, Amazon says that Brief is specifically concise, casual, and direct, with minimal humor, while Sweet is warm, emotionally expressive, casual, and encouraging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDespite the audio samples above, Amazon won't force you to stick with these default voices, either. You can choose a new personality style while, at the same time, swapping between the eight different voice options Amazon offers.How to try Amazon's new personality styles with AlexaAnyone with access to Alexa+—either through the Alexa+ subscription or a Prime subscription—can try these changes. Amazon says it made the process for trying new personality styles quite easy: You can just say \"Alexa, change your personality style.\" Alternatively, you can also find the options in the Alexa app. Select the device in question, then head to Device Settings > Alexa's Personality Style. To change the voice of your chosen style, head to your device's settings again in the Alexa app, then, under \"General,\" choose your voice.  \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That might be a gift registry for a baby shower, or letting your friends and family know what you want for your birthday. But it's also commonly used for online creators to receive gifts from fans or for someone in need to receive donated items from strangers online who want to help. Up until now, we could rely on Wish List as a secure way for strangers to send items, without worrying about setting up a post office box. But going forward, Wish List now runs the risk of telling fans exactly where the creator lives—unless the creator takes action.Amazon is putting addresses at risk with changes to Wish List As reported by 404 Media, Amazon is recommending customers that use Wish Lists to change their shipping addresses to either P.O. boxes or non-residential delivery addresses. The company is making changes to Wish Lists, which could reveal the address you have on file for the feature. By leaving it as your home address, you are putting yourself at risk of doxxing—or revealing your personal address to strangers on the internet. That's because Amazon is now removing the option to block purchases from third-party sellers for Wish List items. As such, anyone who buys items off your Wish List to send to you will be able to buy them from third-party sellers, and those sellers will have access to your delivery address. From Amazon's point of view, these changes give buyers more flexibility over the items they can buy from your list, but that unfortunately comes with an impact on your personal privacy. But it's not just sellers who will have access to this address: Buyers will, too, as they may see your address in shipping updates they receive throughout the buying process.\nAs 404 Media highlights, major shippers don't usually reveal addresses in these situations. But Amazon's changes mean that third-party sellers have it in their power to share this information themselves. What's more, if the delivery person ends up taking photos of the package to confirm delivery, that could leak even more of your personal details than you'd want—such as what your front door or driveway look like.   These changes aren't effective immediately, so if you use Amazon's Wish Lists, you don't have to worry about your home address leaking on the internet just yet. However, the company has set a deadline for March 25, so it's important to act fast if you want to protect yourself. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBelow, you can read the email Amazon is sending the following email to Wish List users:“We're writing to inform you about an upcoming change to Amazon Lists. Starting March 25, 2026, we will remove the option to restrict purchases from third-party sellers for list items. When this change takes effect, gift purchasers will be able to purchase items sold by third-party sellers from your lists and your delivery address will be shared with the seller for fulfillment. This change will provide gift purchasers with access to a wider selection of items when shopping from your lists...Important note: When gifts are purchased from your shared or public lists, Amazon needs to provide your shipping address to sellers and delivery partners to fulfill these orders. During the delivery process, your address may become visible to gift purchasers through delivery updates and tracking information. To help protect your privacy, we recommend using a PO Box or non-residential address for any list you share with public audiences.” How to prevent buyers from seeing your address from your Amazon Wish ListIf you have an online presence and want to protect your address, you'll need to update your address in Wish List settings. Head to this link, then choose \"manage list.\" Here, you can adjust your Wish List settings to make it private, or to choose specific users to share it with. Otherwise, you can adjust your address if you have a P.O. box or alternative address to select. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

While it’s not yet available in the U.S., I’m excited for this to come to the market. The real game changer here isn’t what’s on the ring, but what Ultrahuman has managed to do with the charging case—that is, a lot more than just charging. Specs of the Ultrahuman Ring ProAccording to Ultrahuman, the new ring retails for $429 and has: 15-day battery life—that’s more than RingConn’s battery life and about double Oura’sStorage for 250 days of dataWhole sizes 5 to 14A faster processor that Ultrahuman says allows for more accurate data processingBreak points allowing the ring to be cut apart easily in emergenciesPhysically, the ring looks similar to the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which I’ve previously reviewed. It has a smooth internal surface (no sensor bumps) with a small flat area at the base of the finger. \nThe charging case is the real innovation here\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nWhat really intrigues me about this ring is not the ring itself, or even the fact that it has a charging case, but the fact that Ultrahuman is now using the charging case as a device in its own right. I haven’t seen anything like this from other smart ring manufacturers, and it’s a brilliant idea. For example, smart rings can’t easily act as an alarm, because then they would need components that can vibrate or make noise—thus adding to the bulk of the ring and reducing battery life. But a charging case can easily act as an alarm clock, especially since you’re likely to have it on your nightstand already. (Ultrahuman’s app has an alarm feature, but it didn’t play well with my iPhone’s silent mode and I didn’t find it reliable.) The charging case for the Ultrahuman Ring Pro also has LED indicators, can charge wirelessly, and has a USB-C port. The case has features for diagnostics and troubleshooting, including a button to hard reset the ring if needed. The case can also store up to a year’s worth of ring data and sync it to your phone later.And you know what else I love about the new case? It isn’t sized to the ring. The ring attaches magnetically to the pins on the post, leaving empty space around it if the ring is a large size, and less empty space if it’s a smaller size. If you ever needed to replace the case, you wouldn’t need to find one in your specific size.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy we can’t get this ring in the U.S. (yet?)Legal action behind the scenes has been messing with the U.S. market for smart rings. About a year ago, there were plenty of options, but then Oura made the case to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that it believes its smart ring patent covers the design of nearly every smart ring out there. The ITC agreed, and Ultrahuman was one of the companies that needed to pull its rings from the U.S. market. Ultrahuman said almost immediately that it was working on a new ring design anyway, one that is so differently constructed that it can’t possibly run afoul of the ITC ruling. The Ring Pro appears to be the design it was referring to, with Ultrahuman conspicuously referring to its “unibody architecture” rather than using a design with a transparent lining (that transparent lining is one of the features of the patent at issue). It seems there is still a possibility that this approach may pay off. A spokesperson told me by email today: “We are working through the necessary steps to bring Ring PRO to our U.S. customers and hope to share good news soon.”\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        My best friend messaged me on Facebook Messenger. It wasn’t urgent, so I swiped the notification away, making a mental note to reply later. Ten minutes later, Facebook sends another notification. “Reminder: [My friend] sent you a message.” This is clingy, even for Facebook. And it’s not the only app increasingly desperate for any crumb of attention.In just the last couple months, I’ve personally gotten dozens of what I can only call desperation notifications. Push alerts from apps that don’t really need anything, but would really like it if I gave them some attention anyway. These include, but are not nearly limited to, the following:The Disney+ app let me know that because I watched The Simpsons, I might be interested in watching The Simpsons Movie (which I also recently watched).Discord informed me that someone in a server I'm also in updated their status, which is, I guess, a thing you can do in Discord.Venmo would like me to know I can fund my Kalshi account with my Venmo balance. (I do not and will never have a Kalshi account.)Reddit began sending push alerts for news stories from communities I wasn’t subscribed to and had never visited.Duet sent an aggressive half-dozen notifications within 15 minutes of closing the app, including multiple alerts that read “She just likes you.” Which is a surprisingly exasperated tone for a dating app.GrubHub asked me if I wanted to order food, precisely five minutes after I ordered food.Some of these are obviously just advertisements disguised as alerts—its own annoying problem—but just as many seem to be little more than a reminder that an app exists. And if you could please open the app and boost its engagement numbers, that would be great.\nAre app notifications really getting worse?\n    \n            \n            Wow, I hadn't thought of that, thanks Disney+.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nWhile it’s always hard to quantify vibes-based annoyances, there’s at least some data to back up the idea that companies are getting increasingly desperate for your notification attention. According to a 2025 analysis from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, news publishers have increasingly relied on push notifications to reach their audiences, as a way to avoid relying too much on platforms like Google or social media apps.However, this bid for direct attention comes at a cost—and in the midst of an arms race with platforms. According to the Reuters report, 79% of respondents don’t get any news alerts at all, and 43% of those are because users actively disabled the notifications. Worse yet, iOS and Android have both experimented with questionably reliable AI summaries of notifications, making them even more annoying to deal with.This report only examines one small segment of the notifications you might sift through on any given day, but it’s instructive of a broader trend. We increasingly live in an attention economy, where seemingly unrelated industries are in competition for your eyeballs. Which is how you end up with companies like Netflix investing in video games, or the video game industry competing with gambling sites and porn.In that context, your notifications become the frontline in the battle for your attention. No, it doesn’t take a genius to know that someone who watched The Simpsons might be interested in watching The Simpsons. But if a quick notification can remind me to watch more of the show today, rather than play more Pathologic 3, that’s a win for Disney.And any win is going to be worth it to most companies right now. Broadly speaking, the economy isn’t doing so hot. So, if a company can do something to show that engagement in their app went up by even 5%, they likely will. And sending more notifications is generally one of the cheaper and easier ways to juice internal numbers.How to decrease app notification spam\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere’s at least one silver lining to the whole notification arms race problem: There are a lot of tools available to help get your alerts under control. Some are baked right into your phone’s OS, but there are also third-party tools you can use to enforce some peace and quiet. Here are some of the best options available.Use your phone’s OS-level settings to manage notificationsBoth major smartphone platforms have pretty robust tools to dictate what kind of alerts you can receive, and how disruptive they can be. We have full guides on tools for managing your Android and iOS notifications, but even if you don’t want to dive too deep into your phone’s settings, you can slowly whittle away the most annoying alerts as you receive them.On Android, you can long-press a notification in your shade to find options to tweak or suppress the alerts. Most notifications can be sorted into either Priority, Default, or Silent, which behave differently depending on your default settings. You can also tap the Settings gear icon to dive into the app’s specific notification settings to disable categories of alerts. These will vary by app, but in many cases you can disable things like advertisements or news alerts without turning off messages you actually care about.On iOS, you can find similar tools by swiping on a notification and tapping Options. Here, you’ll find quick shortcuts to do things like mute notifications from an app for a short period of time, or jump to more in-depth settings to disable categories of notifications. In my experience, it’s often easier to tweak these settings whenever I receive a particularly annoying alert, rather than audit all my notification settings at once.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nExplore each app’s notification settingsMost apps have their own category of notification settings that can be adjusted individually. In some cases, these can overlap with the same settings you’ll find using the above method, but just as often, you’ll find a lot more toggles that don’t. Though, some apps are shadier than others in terms of how easy it is to find these settings.For one instructive example, in the Reddit app, you can navigate to Settings > Account Settings > Manage notifications to find a lengthy list of possible alerts you can receive. That’s already pretty buried, but if you sign into the app with multiple accounts, you’ll need to go through this process for each account you’re signed into. Otherwise, notifications you turned off for one account might still pop up via another.Most apps aren’t quite this chaotic, but it can still be annoying to dig through all the tedious menus. In some cases, this might be your only option, though. On Android, Reddit only has one notification category using the previous method, meaning you can only turn all notifications on or off at once. So, if you’re not finding the tools you need to selectively mute certain alerts in the OS-level settings, it might be worth digging through the app’s menus.When all else fails, use third-party toolsIt shouldn’t really be necessary to install an app just to get other apps to shut up, but if we must, then we must. BuzzKill, for Android, is a simple $4 app that gives you more robust tools to filter, manage, or suppress notifications than any of the built-in notification management settings.What sets BuzzKill apart is that, on top of filtering notifications by which app is sending them, it can also filter alerts by things like words they contain, whether they have an image attached, or whether they’re part of a group chat. So, if you want to keep getting news alerts, but you’re just sick of hearing about that one guy who’s always in the headlines for some reason, you can selectively filter those out.Unfortunately, this one’s likely to stay Android only, as iOS generally keeps apps in tighter sandboxes. BuzzKill needs to be able to read notifications from other apps in order to filter them, and that’s not something iOS generally allows apps to do. So, if you’re in the Apple ecosystem, you’ll have to stick with built-in tools for now.More broadly, it also can’t hurt to let app developers know when you’re annoyed by their incessant pings. Companies might try to boost their engagement by testing how much they can poke your attention span before you turn them off (or uninstall the app) entirely. But turning off unnecessary alerts can send a signal that they’ve gone too far in the wrong direction. Sending feedback reports, where possible, can potentially send an even stronger signal.\n            ",

The fitness platform announced today the launch of a 12-week Hyrox training program, timed specifically for athletes preparing for the upcoming Hyrox NYC events taking place May 28-31 and June 4-7, 2026. And if you're not racing in New York, don't worry—the program lives in Peloton's library for all members, meaning you can start it 12 weeks out from any Hyrox event on your calendar.What is Hyrox, anyway?Before diving into the program, a quick primer for the uninitiated. As my colleague Beth Skwarecki explains here, your friend who used to be obsessed with Crossfit is probably now obsessed with Hyrox (unofficially short for \"hybrid rockstar\"). Hyrox is a fitness competition designed for athletes who don't quite see themselves as pure endurance athletes or pure strength athletes, but something in between. What seems to make Hyrox unique—or at least, uniquely appealing—is its consistency. Unlike Crossfit competitions, where the format can change dramatically from event to event, every single Hyrox race follows the same predictable structure: eight 1-kilometer runs, with a functional fitness station in between each one. Those stations include things like sled pushes, wall balls, rowing, and ski erg work, adding up to roughly 5 miles of running plus eight rounds of serious effort. Because the format never changes, you can compare your finish time against anyone else who has ever raced Hyrox, much like comparing marathon times.\nBut one thing that sets Hyrox training apart from something like classic marathon prep is that it's inherently communal. While you can train for a race on your own with nothing but a good pair of shoes, Hyrox training requires access to a rowing machine, a ski erg, a sled, and a wall ball target—in other words, the sort of equipment that's hard to come by outside of gyms geared toward this kind of training. (For the record, most Crossfit gyms and a growing number of commercial gyms can accommodate these types of workouts, but it's worth calling ahead.) That shared training environment tends to foster a community that athletes say is a big part of the draw.What Peloton's Hyrox program offersPeloton's new 12-week program is structured around six training days per week, with many days including both a strength and a run component. Classes include strength, running, rowing, tread bootcamps, mobility and stretching, and meditation. As a regular ol' race runner myself, I’m drawn to the ways these classes cover so many different disciplines.\n    \n            \n            My colleague Beth shares a screenshot of the Peloton Hyrox training program.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nWeek 12 is race week, so the training load lightens considerably as athletes taper toward the starting line. There aren't many workouts that final week, but one notable inclusion is a Hyrox pre-race meditation, which I find speaks to the program's whole community-based philosophy. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Week one of the Peloton Hyrox training program.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            Week 12 of the Peloton Hyrox training program.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nHow Peloton's Hyrox program is builtThe program is grounded in five core principles that Peloton describes as the five pillars of Hyrox performance:Aerobic Power: Threshold work starts on Day 1, teaching athletes how to manage effort and develop sustainable high gears over time.Simple Tools, High Impact: The program leans on running, the erg, and strength training as its primary vehicles for building hybrid endurance.Efficiency Over Speed: Rather than chasing raw pace, the focus is on smart pacing and clean technique that conserves energy across transitions.Progressive Volume: Training load builds deliberately over the weeks, developing the ability to perform under cumulative fatigue.Performance Drivers: Recovery, fueling, and mindset are treated as training components, not afterthoughts.Taking a look at the program here, its structure reflects these principles in a clear arc. The first six weeks focus on building what Peloton calls the \"aerobic engine\" and establishing threshold control, laying the foundation before intensity picks up. By Week 7, athletes complete a 75-minute simulation designed to test their pacing strategy and transition skills under realistic race conditions. The final weeks then shift toward what the program describes as \"real demand\" training, simulating the fatigue carryover of heavy sled pushes and wall balls bleeding into running. Like with any good training program, the goal is to arrive at race day sharp and well-prepared, not worn down.How to join the Peloton Hyrox training programNeedless to say, you need an active Peloton membership. And for now, the Hyrox program can only be joined from the Peloton app or Peloton hardware like the Peloton Bikes, Tread, Row, and Guide. You can’t join from the Peloton website or TV apps. To find it on your device, you can browse the programs area, find the Hyrox Training program, and hit join. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

That's a given when it's time to sell, but making a series of smaller upgrades over time will leave you with less to worry about once it comes time to list it, at which point you'll probably be more focused on interior renovations. Plus, that way you'll get to enjoy coming home to a prettier, well-kept exterior every single day until then.The math around the cost of improvements and their potential return on investment is always complex, but less so when the upgrades don't cost much to begin with. You can handle a lot of projects yourself in a few hours on the weekend, and with modest budgets (often less than $100). Here are a dozen of the best ways to boost your home’s curb appeal without draining your bank account.Add a coat of paint or stain to beautify your front doorThe front door of your house is one of the first things people see, and it has a huge impact on the home’s perceived value. Installing a new front door can have an ROI of almost 200%, but if the average cost of about $2,300 is a bit too rich for your blood, simply painting or staining the door can add thousands of dollars to your home’s value at a cost of less than $100 in materials, and a few hours of your time.Add an awning over the front doorInstalling an awning over your front door or other entrances isn’t an expensive or difficult project, and it can add both beauty and practicality to the exterior of your house, protecting you from rain and drips from your roof line. It also makes your front door more welcoming to guests, who won’t have to stand in the elements waiting for you to answer their knock.\nPatch and seal your driveway before small cracks become a big problemYour driveway should be considered part of your landscaping, because its condition is part of the first impression people form about your house. A cracked, crumbling, stained driveway says all the wrong things (and is a warning of a big repair bill coming sooner rather than later), so cleaning it up and sealing it will go a long way.Sweep away dirt and debrisClean thoroughly with a power wash (you can use dish soap and your garden hose in a pinch)Fill in cracks with a quality crack filler product for asphalt or concrete.Seal the concrete or asphalt with an appropriate product.The total cost will be around $300.Hang exterior art to make your home stand outAn easy, affordable way to make the exterior of your home stand out is to hang some outside wall art. For just a few bucks (this dog-themed piece is just $16, for example) you can give the exterior of your home a bit of your personality, eliminate boring blank space, and make your outdoor spaces more visually interesting. That will prompt guests or potential buyers to think of those spaces as finished, and invite them to imagine themselves using those spaces.Plant some trees to increase your property valueAn easy way to spruce up the exterior of your home is to plant some trees—and trees definitely add to your home’s curb appeal and property value. Trees provide shade, which makes outdoor spaces more comfortable (and can even help keep your interior cooler by blocking some of the sun), and they make an outdoor space feel organic and comfortable. It can even be a $0 investment, because many cities and towns offer free tree programs, so if you’re willing to put in the sweat equity, the project doesn’t have to cost you a thing.Upgrade your mailboxIf your house has a mailbox on the edge of your property, upgrading it has a lot of advantages. For one, a larger mailbox can accommodate packages, meaning fewer crushed items and “we missed you” slips. And a new, stylish mailbox will be a little boost to the overall curb appeal of the house.While you’re at it, consider creating a mailbox garden, if there’s space for it. Building a simple raised garden bed around the mailbox and filling it with native flowers or spreading plants will enhance the mailbox and extend the influence of your landscaping.Refresh your garage door with new hardware and paintYour garage door is literally a huge aspect of your home’s curb appeal—typically anywhere from 50 to several hundred square feet of exterior space. If it’s looking a bit dingy, no amount of landscaping or other tricks will make your house look good. Luckily, upgrading your garage door doesn’t require an expensive replacement, as long as the door is in good physical shape. A coat of good-quality exterior paint can do a world of good. And you can also give your garage door a more lux look by adding some faux hardware whether permanently attached or using magnetic versions. Doing both will come in under $100.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAdd or replace your exterior lightingIf your front door is a dark and gloomy place, adding some lighting (or replacing what's there) will make your home seem a lot more inviting. You don’t need to spend hundreds of bucks and hire an electrician, either—you can pick up a battery- or solar-powered exterior light that installs with a few screws. Not only will this make your exterior a little nicer, it also means not fumbling with your phone’s flashlight when you get home late and can’t quite see your keys.Replace your house numbers with something stylishIf your home’s address is difficult to read, it can be hard to find. And if your home’s address numbers are faded or rusted, it reflects poorly on the rest of the home’s curb appeal. Replacing those numbers is pretty easy—and you have an incredibly wide range of styles to choose from, so you can really match or augment your home’s exterior style. You can get custom address plates made, of course, but you can find address numbers that attach via screws or adhesive if you’re not in the mood to break out the power drill.Install window plant boxes to hide your outdated windowsWhether your windows are brand new or a bit weathered, you can easily upgrade their look (and thus the look of the whole house) with the addition of window garden boxes. They extend your landscaping up onto the vertical space, creating a unified, cohesive look, and they help frame your windows with color and architectural interest. You can just place freestanding boxes on the sill if there’s room, or install something more permanent for a more upscale look.Install ornamental shutters to add visual interestJust like wall art, shutters can fill up the empty space on your exterior walls and create visual interest. They also imply a certain fanciness (that’s a technical real estate term) that can make the whole house look and feel a bit more expensive. But, secretly, they’re an inexpensive and easy upgrade: You can buy a pair of durable, paintable vinyl shutters for under $100, and they install easily, instantly transforming your exterior look and feel.Paint your gutters to make them popIf your gutters are the standard white, they’re an opportunity to make your home’s exterior pop a little more—because you can paint your gutters as easily as anything else. Choose a strong accent color, pick an exterior paint that’s appropriate for your gutter material (plastic or metal, typically), and transform them by spending a few hours painting (being super careful if you’re on a ladder, of course).\n            \n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Jordan and the team.\n            Smarter Home & Living NewsletterNever miss a story.\n                    Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Jordan and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

The Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are $179.99 and come with a $20 Amazon gift card, and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro go for $249.99 and come with a $30 Amazon gift card. Both will be released on March 11, but you can pre-order them now. Considering these will be their flagship earbuds for some time, it's a great opportunity for any Samsung fan or anyone curious about Samsung's new earbuds to snatch them up.\nSamsung wants to compete with Apple, with a similar design, features, and even price point. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are strikingly similar to the Apple AirPods 4 in their design, with noise cancellation and the absence of silicone eartips that go inside your ears. They come with Hi-Res audio, IP54 for water-resistance, a Live Translation feature similar to Apple's, a new design, improvements in call quality, and direct access to ask questions to AI and receive responses through the earbuds. The controls are swipe and pinch, and the charging case comes in black or white.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's also easy to draw the similarities between the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro and the Apple AirPods Pro 3. Apart from both being $249, the most obvious similarity is the in-ear silicone tip design that helps seal the noise and improve ANC. The Pros have all of the same features as the Buds 4, and are supposed to be more comfortable, have better ANC which Samsung calls ANC 2.0, have a better water resistance with an IP57 rating, which handles immersion in water up to 1 meter, and perhaps more importantly, a two-way speaker (as opposed to a one-way on the Buds 4) that is meant to delivers better, high-fidelity sound, superior separation of frequencies, and reduced distortion. But we will only know if these claims are true when we get our hands on them for a review. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            Add to Cart NewsletterShop smarter, save more money.\n                    Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        I’ve been tracking my sleep and recovery with the Oura ring for nearly five years now, and today I’ll share with you several of my favorite and most-overlooked features—including one feature you should turn off, and one feature you can use even if your subscription is expired. \nTurn off blood oxygen sensing to save batteryThe Oura ring uses significantly more battery with blood oxygen sensing turned on. It may make sense to use this feature if you have a specific health concern, but most of us don’t need it on a daily basis. You’ll find Blood Oxygen Sensing under the hamburger menu, and can turn it off from there. You’ll lose the “average blood oxygen” and “breathing regularity” metrics, but you’ll gain an extra day or so of battery life. \nSync workouts so you don’t have to log them all with your ringI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the Oura ring is not a great workout tracker. Wearing the ring interferes with weightlifting workouts and it doesn’t have enough precision to seriously track other workouts like running. Oura is a great companion to other workout apps, though. If you track workouts with another device or even with a phone app like Apple’s Fitness app, you can make sure those workouts get synced properly so they show up in your Oura timeline. Go to Settings, and then to Apple Health (iPhone) or Health Connect (Android). Turn on those integrations from there. Tag auto-detected workouts (and laugh, if appropriate)Aside from synced workouts, Oura will automatically detect workouts it thinks you’re doing. You’ll then see a card asking you to label the workout. Don’t just ignore those cards—Oura learns from your tags. So if you went for a walk, make sure that activity is tagged as a walk. But sometimes it will tag another activity as a workout when it actually wasn’t. I’ve seen hair brushing and yarn winding tagged as various forms of exercise. Take a look at the time the activity was logged, and think back to what you were actually doing at the time. (You can dismiss the activity if it wasn’t a workout or isn’t something you care to track.) Consider the charging caseThe Oura ring only needs to be charged once or twice a week, but that means it’s hard to get into a routine of charging it regularly. I found that the perfect balance was charging it while I’m at the gym; some people prefer to charge while they’re in the shower. Short top-ups every few days are ideal for battery health. (Daily charging is arguably too much; only charging when the battery is dead is probably too little.) Oura recommends keeping the battery between 25% and 80% most of the time, if you can. So figure out where and when is most convenient to charge, and keep a charger there. That’s why the charging case is convenient—you can carry it in your gym bag, for example. Unfortunately it costs an extra $99 to buy the charging case, but nobody ever said owning an Oura ring is cheap. The Trends item in the hamburger menu is one of Oura’s best hidden features. Tap it and you’ll be able to see things that have changed over the past several weeks. For example, as I’m writing this, I can see that my resting heart rate has improved over the past 8 weeks, getting back to my “baseline” after some time in which it was higher than normal.If you’ve been diligent about tagging behaviors and lifestyle factors, you can see their effects on your readiness, sleep, activity, or stress. For example, I’m curious whether my mood is better when I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. Mood isn’t one of the items that Oura tracks, but I can tap Trends and then choose from Stress or Sleep or even Activity (all things that suffer when I’m feeling down) and see whether the days I tagged “vitamins” tend to correlate with higher or lower levels. Log meals without tracking caloriesMeal tracking was introduced as a companion to glucose tracking, but you don’t need to track your glucose to use the meals feature. Log your meals (you can even snap a picture of your plate) and Oura will give you feedback on how healthy the meal is, and keep track of whether you’re eating on a regular schedule or not. Calorie tracking is not involved. In fact, if you’d rather keep calories out of your Oura app entirely, check out the next item. Adjust your activity goalOura will give you an activity goal each day, usually a certain number of calories. If you feel your goals are too ambitious (or not ambitious enough), go to the Activity screen and select Edit activity goal. You can choose a different goal, and you can also choose whether you’d like to see this goal in calories or in steps. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you want to avoid seeing calories anywhere in the app, there’s a toggle for that. On the same screen, select Calorie opt out. This sets your target to steps and ensures that calorie mentions anywhere else in the app will be hidden. You can also access the calorie opt out from Settings and then Activity. Use Rest Mode for travel, menstrual cycles, and moreOura has a Rest Mode setting that is intended for when you’re sick or recovering from an injury. (Oura may even prompt you to turn it on if your data indicates you may not be feeling well.) But it’s useful for more than just that. Rest Mode pauses your goals, and stops giving you readiness scores. It’s great for any time you don’t want the app to bother you about what you should be doing. I’ve seen Oura users say they use it for days of their menstrual cycle when they aren’t feeling up to their usual activity; it’s also useful for travel when you know you’ll be stuck in a car or airplane all day, or when your sleep will suffer due to jet lag. Use Labs to participate in studies (and get a sneak peek at new features)If you like to beta test new features, check out the Labs item in the hamburger menu. The offerings will change from time to time, but often they are new features in the making. Right now, the only offering I see is a blood pressure profile study, in which Oura is collecting data to hopefully offer blood pressure estimates in the app in the future. When I signed up for this, I had to fill out a questionnaire and sign a research consent. (Not all Oura Labs items are studies, but they can be.) I can see that Oura thinks I probably don’t have hypertension (correct) and that it’s basing that in part on my good resting heart rate and activity level. Other Oura features like meal tracking and Symptom Radar first made their appearances in Labs. Download your data from the cloudThis is one of Oura’s lesser-known features: a web dashboard where you can view long-term trends, and a “membership hub” where you can download all your data. This spreadsheet download is available even if you don’t have an active subscription, but you do need a subscription for the trend viewer and for all of the software features I mentioned above. For the web viewer, go to cloud.ouraring.com. Here, if you click on Trends, you can see all your data—five years’ worth, for me. You can even compare two variables and see a calculation that shows if they’re correlated. My sleep score and total sleep time are highly correlated; my HRV and sleep time are not. To download CSV spreadsheets of your data (with or without a subscription), go to the membership hub and sign in. Select Export data and then Request your data. You’ll get a zip file filled with spreadsheets you can analyze to your heart’s content.\n            ",

All that user-friendliness has left a lot of power on the table. Casual Questers don't know that the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor is powerful enough to handle spatial computing and multitasking that rivals some laptops, and that they can link their headset to a PC for close-to-4K visuals that rival much more expensive headsets. With the right software and a little bit of monkeying around with (often-hidden) settings, you can take the Quest 3 and 3S way beyond its the out-of-the-box performance. Below are ten hacks every Meta Quest user should know to get the most out of their headset.\nIf you choose just one hack, it should be downloading Quest Game Optimizer. QGO is a third-party utility that lets you control a ton of hidden settings for any Quest game or app. Meta typically locks its hardware to conservative clock speeds to preserve battery and thermal headroom, but QGO lets you force the Quest's chip to work at its maximum power. Most impressively, it lets you to increase the internal render resolution up to 300%, effectively \"supersampling\" your games to match the high-fidelity density of the Quest 3’s pancake lenses. It really makes a difference. As you might have guessed, you won't find QGO on the official Meta Store, and it takes some lightly hacker-ish work to set up. To get it running, you'll need to:\nPurchase the software. It's currently $9.99 on itch.io.Create a developer account with Meta. This is free, and you can do it from inside your headset.Enable Developer Mode on your Meta account.Uncompress the QGO app. Either sideload the compressed Android file on your PC using a tool like SideQuest, or unzip it straight in the headset using a file manager like AnExplorer or Mobile VR Station. Grant Accessibility Permissions within the headset to allow the optimizer to override system defaults.That's the gist, but check out these deeper guides for how to do all of the above with just your Quest headset, with SideQuest and a PC, and through Meta Quest's developer's mode. Link your Quest to your PCYou can take the Quest 3 beyond standalone by linking it to your PC, either tethered or with a virtual link. This offloads the computing to a more powerful processor, turns your headset into a high-def display, and lets you use programs like Half-Life: Alyx or Microsoft Flight Simulator that would be impossible to run natively. You'll seriously be shocked at how good they look and how smoothly they run. You can do this in two ways:Wired This is the best choice for the highest possible fidelity visuals and the easiest set-up, plus you don't have to worry about how fast your wifi works. Open the Meta Horizon Link app on your PC.Get a high-quality USB-C 3.1 cable or the Meta Link Cable, and plug it in.Follow the instructions on your headset.WirelessThis is the choice if you want the freedom of wireless connection and you have really reliably wifi. For best results, connect your PC to your router via Ethernet, make sure your Quest 3 is on a 5GHz or 6GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) band, and use the Quest and PC in the same room.Run Meta Horizon Link on your PC.In the Quest, go to \"quick settings\" and select the \"Link\" tile.Switch \"Use Air Link\" to \"On,\" select your PC, and hit \"Pair.\"Click \"Launch\" and you'll be streaming directly from your PC to your face computer.Meta lets users test out \"coming soon\" features in its experimental menu and get an early look at \"quality-of-life\" improvements, most of which will be heading to the Quest soon. Among other improvements, the current experimental menu contains a couple of bangers: \"lying down mode,\" and \"Meta AI\" integration. Here's how to check it out:Open the \"Settings\" menu.Scroll down to the Experimental tab on the left-hand sidebar.Toggle the features you want to try. This brand new (as of February 2026) feature is evidence of how hard Meta is leaning into mixed reality. Spatial locking lets you anchor windows wherever you want in physical space, so you can look at your real television and see a virtual one, have three virtual monitors extending your workspace, or create a window to YouTube over your sink for when you're washing dishes. Bonus: The Quest will remember where these windows are when you restart it. Here's how it works:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMake sure you're in pass-through mode. Open a window in your headset.Grab the window with the control bar at the bottom and move it where you'd like.Select the \"anchor\" icon on the control bar.This won't work with travel mode. But speaking of travel mode...Yes, you'll look sort of dorky on a plane, but the Quest 3's travel mode makes it possible to use your Quest on the road by creating a stationary boundary, and setting the Quest to ignore external velocity and rely only on head movements. Here's how to turn it on:Go to the \"Settings\" menu.Click on \"Environmental Set Up.\" Click on \"Travel Mode.\"Bigscreen Beta is the go-to video streaming app on Quest headsets. It allows you to sit in a highly detailed virtual environment—a cozy modern living room, a massive outdoor drive-in, another planet, etc.—and stream video. You can use the Bigscreen Remote Desktop tool on your PC to stream content from Netflix, Disney+ or just about anywhere else directly into your virtual environment. Not only that, you can stream content directly from Bigscreen into your private space, invite friends over to watch with you, or watch movies and TV with strangers in shared virtual theaters. If you have an Xbox Live account, you can play (2D) Xbox games right from your VR headset, giving you a portable game console with a 100\" screen. Here's how it works:Download the XBox app on your Quest headset.Pair a controller with your Quest. Quest controllers aren't made to work with XBox games, so you'll have to use Bluetooth to pair a game controller to your Quest. You can use an XBox controller, a PS5 controller, a Switch 2 controller, and a ton of generic controllers. Run the Xbox app and choose a game. Enable passthrough. This lets you play your game on as big a screen as you'd like while still being in the \"real\" world.There can be some latency, as the game is being run from the cloud, but it's surprisingly smooth in my experience. WebXR might be the Quest's biggest secret. It lets you use a seemingly infinite number of games and apps that are not available in the Meta store, and are almost all free. Since WebXR apps are browser based, all you have to do is point your Meta browser to a site that hosts a WebXR program and hit go. If you like experimental little tests and whatnot, you'll never run out.  Here are some to check out:Moon Rider: A totally free, open-source alternative to Beat Sabre. Silkbrush: A web-based version of the famous Tilt Brush that lets you paint in 3D space.Above Par-adowski: A surprisingly deep browser-based miniature golf game.You can do a lot with your Quest without even turning it on. The Meta Horizon mobile app lets you manage your library, download games, change your settings, and more, all without strapping anything to your face. Browsing the Meta store feels way more natural on the app, and it's easier to navigate and change setting there too. Plus, the app can tell you how much charge is left in your battery, whether your friends are online, download screenshots and videos, and cast what's going on in your headset to another screen. The Meta Quest 3 is ergonomically fine for shorter sessions, but if you wear it long enough, you realize how much the design is a battle between comfort and performance, and it compromises on both ends—it's kind of heavy and the battery life is kind of short. The front-weighted design puts pressure on your face and the battery life rarely survives a two-hour session, but there's a solution to both problems: Trade the stock fabric strap for a third-party \"Elite\" style strap with a built in extra battery, like the KIWI design H4 Boost or the BOBOVR S3 Pro. These move the extra weight to the back of your head, balancing the ergonomics, and they have swappable extra batteries so you can use your headset as long as you'd like. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

We think we know the \"tells,\" like poorly formulated communication that sounds urgent. Unfortunately, social engineering—tactics that prey on human emotions and instincts to get us to act against our own interests—can work on anyone. Romance scams are a textbook example of emotional manipulation in which the perpetrator exploits a victim's feelings of loneliness, love, or desire for connection to build trust over the long term. Beyond the emotional toll, the financial consequences are significant: The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported $672 million in romance scam losses in 2024, and this number is almost certainly only a fraction of the real total. Scammers are increasingly employing AI tools in romance scams, making these campaigns even harder to detect and therefore even more dangerous for targets. Experian predicts that AI-powered romance scams will be among the top fraud threats in 2026. \nHow a romance scam worksAs McAfee describes in a recent report on the state of romance scams, this type of fraud is a long con. A romance scam typically starts with a \"hook,\" like a DM, follow request, \"wrong number\" text, or match on a dating app. Once a scammer gets a response, they'll move into love bombing in an attempt to quickly build intimacy and trust while encouraging you to keep the relationship a secret. They'll take time to build credibility around their persona, which likely includes a job or lifestyle that prevents them from meeting you. Next comes a minor request for financial support, which may escalate into opening an account, \"investing\" in a business venture, or co-signing a loan. Increasingly, these schemes involve fraudulent investments in cryptocurrency. (Another term for this is \"pig butchering.\") Once they've got what they want, scammers disappear, leaving victims to deal with the consequences. Romance scams work because they don't start with obvious exploitation. Fraudsters build up trust over weeks and months, so it's more likely to feel like a real relationship than a scam until victims are already in too deep.  AI is making romance scams even easier for fraudsters to run. In a review of recent research, Bitdefender notes that in order to build trust, scammers have traditionally had to devote significant time and attention to each individual target. While playing the long game in this way is often worth the effort—as the payoff is often significant—it limits the number of potential victims any one scammer could reach. AI removes these barriers. Large language models (LLMs) are capable of maintaining natural conversations without the red flags of a scam, such as poor grammar and misspellings. AI can mirror personality, reflect emotion, and match tone, and it's less likely than a human to come off as pressured or rushed. Chatbots can retain and integrate personal details from earlier conversations, and it requires very little effort to sustain for a very large number of victims. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAutomated chatbots are especially adept at handling the early stages of a romance scam, and humans are required to step in only at critical moments to offer reassurance or initiate a financial request. Because scammers can maintain many conversations at once, they can also test out different tactics and quickly refine based on what works best to keep victims engaged. As the Global Cyber Alliance puts it, AI adds \"speed, scale, and consistency\" to the traditional romance scam.Research suggests that victims may actually find AI more trustworthy than a human. McAfee found that a third of American adults believe it's possible to develop romantic feelings toward an AI bot. Deepfake audio and video make these AI-powered scams even more credible, as victims can no longer rely on a scammer's refusal to actually speak with them as a red flag. How to catch a romance scamEven a well-trained chatbot has limitations. According to McAfee, the most common clues that you're interacting with a bot or fake profile include scripted or repetitive responses, instant (and perfectly crafted) replies, and photos that are obviously generated by AI. Other red flags include a contact who avoids voice and video calls as well as unusual requests early in the relationship. To avoid getting wrapped up in an AI-powered romance scam, slow down. Be wary of perfectly crafted responses, which may indicate automation. Try asking unexpected questions or creating friction, which can throw a chatbot off. Remember that relationships shouldn't rely on secrecy or be contingent on financial support. Social media and dating sites are full of fake profiles, so seeing is not always believing. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    ",

Fraudsters are impersonating representatives from mobile carriers, calling customers and claiming that they've been sent the wrong device and need to return it. Obviously, if you follow through, scammers get to keep your phone—they may either to sell it or activate it using your information to perpetrate identity fraud. Scams centered on stealing high-value tech aren't anything new. In addition to regular porch pirating, thieves have been known to knock on doors, posing as couriers or company representatives attempting to recover a \"wrongly delivered\" item. Fraudsters have also used fake Find My alerts to gain access to lost or stolen iPhones. \nHow the phone return scam worksAs an editor at ZDNET experienced, the scam begins shortly after your new phone is delivered. You may receive a call from a spoofed number, and someone claiming to represent your carrier will have specific information like your name, address, and device model. They'll tell you that there's been a mix-up and you need to send your phone back so you can receive a replacement. They may give you instructions to scan a QR code, print a label, and take the package to a shipping drop-off point. In some cases, targets have been promised gift cards for the inconvenience. If you hesitate, scammers may employ a number of pressure tactics to get you to act. They'll tell you that delaying the return could cause issues with your device activation, billing, or warranty. They may continue to call with threats. Like many scams, this one relies on social engineering: it manipulates emotions and instincts to get you to act against your best interest. Fraudsters impersonate a trusted brand and use detailed information about you to make their story more believable. They use timing to their advantage and promote a sense of urgency. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe phone return scam also has similarities to the brushing scam, in which victims receive a package containing merchandise they didn't order so that scammers can write a verified review or boost sales numbers or collect personally identifiable information once you scan a QR code (an added component known as quishing) to learn more about the item. What to do if you get a call about your new phoneThe solution here is to simply hang up. If you are concerned about your account or device, call your carrier directly (use the customer service number from a previous bill or go through the official app) and confirm the mix-up. Don't engage with QR codes or any instructions provided on unsolicited calls. It may be alarming that a scammer has specific details about your order and calls right after your new phone is delivered. Unfortunately, a lot of your personal information is out in the open and available to bad actors, whether as the result of a data breach or some other form of compromise (such as malware that can read notifications). This is a good reason to keep an eye out for other indicators of identity theft and act quickly if you find anything suspicious. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            The Daily NewsletterReady to do everything better?\n                    Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

According to an announcement from Meta, these notifications will be available to parents in the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada who supervise their teen's accounts starting next week. As TechCrunch reports, this feature is being rolled out amid numerous lawsuits over how Meta and other tech companies have failed to protect kids and teens across their platforms. How the new safety alerts workInstagram will use teens' search activity to generate alerts. Searches that are flagged include \"phrases promoting suicide or self-harm, phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves, and terms like ‘suicide’ or ‘self-harm,'\" according to Meta. \nParents will receive alerts via email, text, or WhatsApp as well as an in-app notification. The message lets parents know that their teen has \"repeatedly searched\" for content related to suicide or self-harm and includes resources for supporting teens. Instagram already blocks searches associated with suicide and self-harm, directing users to resources instead. While users can post about their personal experiences, Meta's policies do not allow content that promotes or glorifies these topics, and Instagram hides related content from teens (even if it's from someone they follow). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEnable parental supervision on InstagramTo receive alerts, parental supervision must be enabled on your teen's account. Supervision allows parents to set app time limits, enable sleep mode, and monitor and manage things like account settings, followers, accounts followed, content topics searched, and app usage. Parental supervision is available for teens ages 13–17, and teens have to agree to participate. To send a supervision invite to your teen, open the More menu in the bottom-left and click Settings. Select Supervision > Create Invite, review the information, and hit Continue. From here, you can copy the invite to send via any messaging app. Note that teens can decline supervision requests—the feature is opt-in for both parties. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The feature is called Smart Reorder, and it allows you to automatically sort your songs by BPM (beats per minute) and key. This is great for those who want to gradually bump up the intensity of the songs they listen to.It's worth noting that this feature only works for playlists you've created or those you've mixed using the Spotify Mix feature, which lets you add or customize song transitions like a DJ would. Also, because Smart Reorder is an extension of Spotify Mix, you can't have one without the other. Spotify Mix hasn't yet been launched in all markets where the streaming service is present, including where I live, and as such, Smart Reorder isn't available in those regions yet. It's a shame, because I'm really excited to try it.How to use Smart Reorder in SpotifyIf you're a Spotify Premium subscriber, using the Smart Reorder feature is easy. Just open any of the playlists you've created or mixed, and tap the Edit button above the first song. Scroll to the bottom and select Smart Reorder. Spotify will automatically rearrange your songs by BPM, and you can tap the Save button up top to confirm the changes.\nSmart Reorder should be a very useful feature for people like me, who prefer workout playlists that slowly bump up in intensity. I like to hear high BPM songs towards the end of my gym sessions or runs, but that might not be ideal for everyone. Some types of exercises, such as spin workouts, might be better off switching between high and low BPM songs as the intensity varies, and Smart Reorder wouldn't be great for those use cases. Some users on Reddit also suggested that you should create a copy of your playlists before using Smart Reorder on them, since you can't automatically restore playlists to their original order if you end up not liking the changes after saving them. To duplicate a Spotify playlist, open the playlist and tap the three-dots button above the list of songs. Select Add to other playlist > New playlist, then add a name for the copy and and tap Create. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThis is another example of Spotify doing more with its AI DJ feature than Apple Music, where the AutoMix AI DJ feature has been more of a mixed bag for me. At the moment, AutoMix just handles song transitions, and Apple hasn't added any kind of custom playlist reordering to it.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            The Download NewsletterNever miss a tech story.\n                    Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday When you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ Black Friday tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it is the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily bad, impulse buyers may not realize what they're purchasing.How to tell if a Black Friday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.In order to avoid a low-key scam, you should do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). The bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The sale runs though Cyber Monday, and it's a one-time payment for lifetime access. Once you buy, the redemption code gets emailed to you instantly, and you have 30 days to activate it. There are no recurring fees, just a fully loaded development environment with features that make coding faster, cleaner, and less of a headache.This version of Visual Studio marks a shift—it’s their first 64-bit IDE that handles larger projects without choking. If you’ve ever waited for your code editor to stop freezing while dealing with massive workloads, that’s less of a concern here. It supports cross-platform app development through .NET MAUI, so you're covered whether you’re building for Android, iOS, or desktop. Plus, features like Live Share make collaboration more streamlined. You can co-code in real time, control what collaborators see, and even carry over your custom settings. There’s also IntelliCode, which is basically AI that learns your coding habits and fills in the blanks intelligently. It can finish lines of code or suggest the next logical move based on your style and context. It’s a little eerie, but it works. You can also build, test, and deploy to Azure right from the IDE, which is great if you’re cloud-focused.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere are some things to keep in mind. This is for Windows users only. If you’re working on a Chromebook, iPad, or even a 32-bit system—this won’t work. It’s compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and you’ll need at least 4GB of RAM (though more is better). Depending on the number of features you install, it also requires storage space ranging from 850MB to 210 GB. For just $10 for Microsoft Visual Studio, this is a great steal and worth trying out. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The sale ends after Cyber Monday. Once you've purchased, the redemption code and setup instructions will be sent to your inbox. Just make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (like a 1GHz processor, 4GB RAM, TPM 2.0, and UEFI firmware, among others). This isn’t an upgrade path for unsupported PCs—it’s a fresh install for machines that meet the full list of Windows 11 Pro requirements.The Windows 11 Pro layout is cleaner, Snap Layouts and virtual desktops make multitasking smoother, and redocking windows actually works like you'd expect. If you’re into voice typing or just want better search across apps and docs, it delivers. Windows 11 Pro also includes some solid professional tools, such as BitLocker for encryption, Hyper-V for virtualization, and even a sandbox mode for testing apps safely. You’re also getting DirectX 12 Ultimate, so your hardware can shine during gaming or graphics-intensive tasks, assuming your machine is sufficiently powerful.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWindows 11 Pro also doubles down with biometric login, Smart App Control, and TPM 2.0 requirements, which makes it a tougher nut to crack. It also includes the new AI-powered Copilot and baked-in Microsoft Teams support, which might appeal to remote workers. Just a heads up, you won’t get an Office upgrade bundled in with this deal—this is strictly a Windows license. It will work alongside Office if you have a separate license, though (if you’re on a Mac using Parallels Pro). Overall, this $10 deal is about as straightforward and affordable as it gets.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The deal runs through Cyber Monday. The standout here is that you’re not just getting a license for Visual Studio, which is already a powerhouse development environment, but also lifetime access to more than 60 hours of beginner-to-advanced coding instruction.Visual Studio Pro 2022 itself is widely used in professional environments, built for serious dev work—think C#, Python, .NET, and more. You get tools like IntelliCode for AI-assisted coding suggestions, built-in Git support, debugging, and advanced testing features, all of which are useful whether you're building a small app or working on enterprise-level projects. Normally, licenses for just the IDE can get expensive, so getting it bundled with a full curriculum covering JavaScript, React, Python, CSS, and more is the kind of package that feels designed for someone starting out with ambition or a side hustle in mind.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this is a Microsoft-centric deal. If you’re aiming to become a Mac-based developer or work heavily with Xcode and iOS projects, this probably won’t be your best fit. The same goes if you’re already deep into development and just looking for a few advanced certifications, as some of the coursework may feel too foundational. But if you’ve been stuck in tutorial limbo, this bundle provides structure, software, and real-world tools at a reasonable price. For under $40, it’s hard to beat the value, especially for learners who want both a development platform and a guided roadmap in one place.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

They are on sale for $249 on Amazon (originally $299) until Dec. 1. \nIf you're not familiar, these smart glasses basically put a high-definition display in your pocket, projecting the equivalent of a 201-inch TV in front of your face—so if someone on your list is tech-inclined and you want to blast 'em with a pure \"whoa\" present, here you go. They'll even fit in a stocking.There are other glasses that do the same thing, but the Ray Neo Air 3 Pro hit a nice sweet spot between inexpensive and good quality. Check out my review if you want to read about these glasses in more depth, but the bottom line is: if you want to make every flight you'll ever take better or stream videos and games in private, these glasses will do the trick. How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. \n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

If you're looking for your first pack of smart lights, my Black Friday recommendation would be the three-pack Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Light Bulbs, yours for $69.99 for Black Friday – the lowest the pack has ever been on Amazon.\nI've been using Philips Hue lights in my home for years, and can thoroughly recommend them. They're versatile and reliable, they come in all shapes and sizes, they integrate with a whole host of third-party apps and services, and they offer a bunch of features for you to play around with.The app is really well designed and makes it easy to do simple tasks (like just turn your lights on and off and adjust their color) and more complex ones (like setting up different lighting scenes for different times of the day) alike. These Philips Hue A19 Smart Bulbs can work on their own, but to access the full set of features, it's worth investing in a Philips Hue Bridge as well, which will make adding more lights really easy too.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

So when the new Airwrap i.d. drops in price, it's always worth noting. Right now, the hair-styling device is at its lowest price ever, according to price trackers—$499.99, down from the usual $649.99.Even with the discount, it’s still very much a premium splurge, but the appeal of the Airwrap starts to make sense once you actually use it. This is not a simple blow-dryer: It is a multi-styler built around airflow rather than extreme heat, which matters if you style often and want to avoid frying your hair in the process. For some buyers, that alone justifies the cost, especially if they have thick or color-treated hair that reacts badly to heat plates.The Airwrap i.d. builds on Dyson’s standard attachments and adds Bluetooth pairing through the MyDyson app, which may seem like a strange match for a hair tool. But in practice, it comes in handy when you’re figuring out what works for you by letting you save styling preferences by hair type, length, and texture. The app also offers step-by-step styling guides and recommends attachments based on your desired look. Compared with the standard Airwrap, the i.d. stands out mostly for this personalization. Where the tool falls short is the same place older versions do. It is still expensive, even with this discount, and travel cases or extra attachments raise that cost.The kit includes six attachments: a smoothing dryer, two curling barrels (for each direction), a round volumizing brush, and two paddle brushes. It also dries and styles at the same time, which cuts down the usual back and forth with multiple tools. That said, the learning curve is real, especially if you’re used to traditional curlers. The results depend a lot on your hair texture and patience, and not everyone ends up with salon-level curls in the first week. Still, for anyone seeking gentler, customizable hair styling, this deal on the Airwrap i.d. is one of the more meaningful price drops of the season.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Does Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

It saves me a lot of money, and I still get access to premium products with almost all of the features I need. And now that the AirPods Pro 3 are out, it's a great time to start looking for deals on the older AirPods Pro 2 before stocks are cleared. This Walmart deal brings the AirPods Pro 2 to an all-time low price of $139 (which is $100 off the list price), and they're an absolutely fantastic piece technology for that price.The best sale on Apple AirPods Pro 2 for Black Friday\nAlthough the AirPods Pro 2 launched a few years ago, they've received enough software updates to make them far more capable than they were at launch. Now, the AirPods Pro 2 are also approved for use as a hearing aid in the US, and still offer excellent noise isolation with great sound quality. I live in a really noisy city and I cannot roam around without wearing my AirPods for fear of triggering my migraines. My AirPods Pro (Gen 1) do a good job at cutting out the noise, but the AirPods Pro 2 take the cancellation to another level. I've used and compared all three generations of AirPods, and the noise cancellation on the Pro 2 is solid. It's not as good as that on the Pro 3, but it's better than on the Pro 1, and the difference isn't big enough to spend nearly twice the price for the latest product.The AirPods Pro 2 are everything I need to keep migraines away. They block out the worst of the loud noises around me while being light and comfortable enough to wear all day. My city has extremely humid weather, which makes it near impossible to wear over-ear headphones outdoors. However, I feel quite comfortable with my AirPods, and I've been waiting for nearly four years to upgrade mine. While I was saving up for the AirPods Pro 3, this deal is too good to resist, and I may just get the Pro 2 instead and save the rest of my cash to upgrade my Apple Watch.Does Apple do Black Friday?Yes, Apple participates in Black Friday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Black Friday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAre Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

But unless you need something with exceptionally powerful hardware or are operating on a very tight budget, I'm here to end your search right now: You should buy the M4 MacBook Air, especially while it's on sale for $749 before Black Friday.\nApple's latest MacBook Air is, without a doubt in my mind, the best laptop for most people—at least for people who don't need to run Windows. This is an entry-level machine, but it doesn't feel like it: The laptop comes with Apple's M4 chip, which was until very recently the company's newest hardware. (That being said, there is no M5 MacBook Air yet, so this is still the best Air on the market.) Apple's M-series is excellent: In fact, the M1 MacBook Air is still a great machine five years after its release. You kind of can't go wrong with any M-series MacBook at this time, though the newer the hardware, the better the performance—a perk to this M4 Air. But M4 is almost an afterthought for me compared to this machine's 16GB of RAM. For years, Apple only included 8GB of RAM with its base model machines. That was enough for smaller, simpler tasks, but once you started trying to do too much at once, you ran into problems. 8GB of RAM doesn't go as far as it used to, so the fact that this machine doubles that memory without impacting the price is a major win. That said, this configuration does come with 256GB of storage, which could pose a problem for anyone who stores large files on their computers.My favorite thing about the M4, however? The price. When Apple released this machine back in March, I was impressed by how much value one could get for $999. In fact, it convinced me to move on from recommending the M2 MacBook Air, even when the latter was on sale. But despite how new it is, the M4 MacBook Air has also seen discounts this year. Now, ahead of Black Friday, the machine is $250 cheaper at Amazon and Best Buy than at Apple. That's simply a fantastic deal. Should you buy an older MacBook for less?Of course, there are other, cheaper MacBooks out there. You can save another $50 and opt for the M2 MacBook Air, which also has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. And if you don't need your machine to be brand-new, you can find refurbished M1 MacBook Airs for under $500. Any of these laptops will work great in 2025, but there are drawbacks: The M1 only has 8GB of RAM and it retains Apple's older MacBook Air design. The M2 MacBook Air looks identical to its M4 counterpart, but it is three years old. By spending the extra $50 on the newer Air, you may eke another two to three years of software updates out of your machine—not to mention the immediate performance gains from the new chip.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, Nov. 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.

That's still a significant investment, but it's a drop of $130 on a tablet that only launched last month.\nI haven't had the pleasure of getting my hands on the latest M5 model, but I have tested previous iPad Pros, and can vouch for their superior build quality, lighting-fast performance, and supreme versatility (there are so many great iPad apps out there, with more arriving every day).Despite the best efforts of Android manufacturers, and the other slates in Apple's line-up, the iPad Pro remains the best tablet out there, period. Sure, it's also the most expensive, but sometimes paying more is worth it—and thanks to this Black Friday discount, you're not paying quite as much as before.Add in a keyboard cover and perhaps an Apple Pencil too, and you're looking at a powerful portable workstation that may even be able to replace your laptop. This is the lowest price that the 13-inch iPad Pro (M5, 1TB) has even been on Amazon—in its short history—so it's a deal worth taking advantage of at your earliest opportunity.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The housing is weather-resistant and feels sturdy, and its two LED lamps reach 2,000 lumens, bright enough to cover a driveway or the far corner of a backyard. The camera sits right below them and records in 2K with a wide 160-degree field of view, which helps avoid the frustration of narrow or grainy clips that do not show much.There’s some actual substance in the features, too. The lights help activate color night vision, though the unit can also default to black-and-white with infrared for added contrast. Video quality in the daytime looks crisp and well-balanced, and nighttime footage holds its own, according to a review from PCMag. You also get two-way talk and a built-in siren. It works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT, so it’ll fit into most smart homes, but not all. (If you’re a dedicated HomeKit user, this isn’t the camera for you.) And it’s worth noting that most of the advanced functionality, like saving footage, receiving smart alerts, and setting motion zones, requires a subscription to Arlo Secure, which starts at $7.99 a month. Without it, you can still livestream footage, but that’s about it.Installation isn’t as simple as sticking it to the wall and walking away. This is a hardwired floodlight camera, which means you’ll need to connect it directly to your home’s electrical setup. Arlo’s app walks you through the process with QR code instructions, and some reviewers report a quick install with the right tools and an existing junction box. Still, if you’re not comfortable flipping breakers and wiring connections, hiring someone is the safer call. All things considered, though, this is a solid mid-range security camera with a floodlight that’s rarely this affordable.How long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Black Friday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year.

The sale runs through Cyber Monday. It's a lifetime of ad-blocking for less than what some services charge per month, but it's only available to new users, and you’ll need to redeem your code within 30 days of buying it.You can access and utilize this plan across nine devices, making it a solid pick for families or anyone juggling multiple gadgets. It works on Windows (7 and later), macOS (10.15 and later), iOS (12 and later), and Android (7 and later), covering most modern setups. AdGuard goes beyond standard ad-blocking by filtering out annoying pop-ups, stopping autoplay videos, and blocking phishing attempts. It also reduces trackers that follow you around the internet, which means less targeted advertising and a little more privacy. Unlike browser-based ad blockers, AdGuard operates at the network level, allowing it to block ads in apps and games as well. Setup is straightforward—you’ll receive your redemption code via email immediately after purchase, allowing you to start using it right away.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re already an AdGuard user, this deal won’t apply to you, but for new users looking for a one-time payment solution to dodge ads and boost privacy across multiple devices, this might be one of the best Black Friday deals out there right now.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

Right now, Microsoft Visio 2021 Professional is on sale for just $10 for a lifetime license on StackSocial for new users. The deal runs through Cyber Monday. It’s priced low enough to justify adding to your digital toolbox, whether you use it often or just occasionally. It’s the same full version of Visio Pro, licensed for one Windows PC, no subscription required.Visio turns overwhelming data into clean visuals. Visio keeps things intuitive, whether mapping a new office layout, building org charts from Excel data, or sketching a workflow diagram with a stylus on your touch device. The interface is packed with over 250,000 shapes and templates (that aren't included in the web version), including standards-compliant options like UML 2.5 and BPMN 2.0. It’s more than just drawing boxes and arrows—it lets you link diagrams to live data and keep everything dynamic. It’s ideal for IT, architecture, business analysis, and other professionals who don’t want to start from scratch whenever they plan something out.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, it’s not the most plug-and-play experience for everyone. While the standalone license is solid, unlocking features like cloud collaboration, editing Power BI dashboards, or syncing with OneDrive requires additional Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

I stumbled upon this older one by Epicka and bought it almost without thinking, something I rarely do. That turned out to be one of my best purchase decisions ever, because that travel adapter is still going strong. I've taken it to multiple countries and have used it extensively while traveling to remote locations in India, where you don't always have a reliable power supply. Last year, I gave it away to a friend I met during a meditation retreat, and she's been happily using it since then.This is the first time I've had a travel adapter for that long. I'd bought a few crappy ones before, and they couldn't always reliably charge multiple devices or last very long. This Epicka unit was quite impressive in that regard, but it did have a couple of limitations. It was a fairly slow charger, and it had only one USB-C port. I've been looking to upgrade to a better travel adapter for about a year now, and I think I'm going to do it this time. Epicka has another model with three USB-C ports and support for up to 75W charging, which makes it ideal for me. That one is now down to its lowest ever price in a Black Friday deal.\nEven at the deal price of $45 (15% off), it is a bit pricey, but I think the premium is worth paying for a fast charger from a brand with a good track record. I will say that this product is a bit bulky, and some people will prefer to travel with a more compact charging adapter, but its size never bothered me much. You also get two USB-A ports (one on each side) in this adapter, which is good for those with older charging cables.This Epicka universal travel adapter has a 4.8 rating on Amazon, with a total of 336 reviews at time of writing. The general consensus among Amazon reviewers is that this is a great product. One review says that if you charge multiple devices, this adapter splits power evenly across the devices, which means that all devices will be charged reasonably quickly. It has plugs for the US, UK, Australia, and EU, and a nice locking mechanism to keep the plugs in place.Note, though, that if you're planning to use high-wattage electronics such as hair dryers with this adapter, then it's not for you. This adapter is also not a voltage converter, so be sure to check if your electronics ship with a built-in converter when using the Epicka adapter in other countries. Most phone and laptop chargers are dual voltage, so you probably won't have to worry about it much, but safety first.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Black Friday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

    "body": "\n        \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        There are likely occasions in your day-to-day life in which you allow someone else to use your phone, whether it's letting your kid play a game or sharing content with a friend. You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts. If you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)To pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning. \nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app: Gesture navigation: Swipe up and hold2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + OverviewNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.If you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out RemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).How to run RemoveWindowsAI on your machineTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies. See personalized, AI-powered snapshots Gmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.AI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\" \nGet AI Overviews via Gmail searchGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAI will proofread your emailsFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise. Like AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.POP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.How to keep your third-party accounts working in GmailIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.Use IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.The IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n    \n        Add as a preferred source on Google\n\n            Credit: Intricuit\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Plenty of people have been asking for a MacBook with a touchscreen display, and now that is possible with the Intricuit Magic Screen, according to an announcement at CES 2026. It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This year, Intel debuted its first line of chips made with its 18a process, which stands for 18 angstroms, or under 2nm. To make that a little less nerdy, that means these chips can fit a lot of tech into a small area, which means big gains in performance.Colloquially called Panther Lake, the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips are focused on laptops and mini-PCs. But that doesn't mean they don't put out impressive numbers. During its keynote, Intel promised \"77% faster gaming performance,\" and for everyone actually using their PCs to do work, \"60% better multithread performance.\" Impressively, it also said its new chips would also enable \"up to 27 hours of battery life,\" rivaling Apple's M-series chips and other ARM chips from manufacturers like Qualcomm. Battery life has been a sore spot for both Intel and AMD for a while, and I'm excited to get my hands on machines that use Panther Lake processors.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Intel\n                    \n    \nAnd then there's the AI. Intel says its top Intel Core Ultra Series 3 models have 50 NPU TOPs and 180 TOPS in total when you combine the NPU and GPU numbers. To translate, that basically means faster AI performance for developers who don't want to bother with the cloud, and would prefer the speed and privacy of a locally downloaded AI model. \nSpeaking of that GPU, Intel's upgraded its integrated graphics this generation to the Intel Arc B390, which has twice the cache of its prior GPU and 50% more cores. I already mentioned that 77% increase in gaming performance, but AI developers will also see a 53% increase in performance over Intel Core Ultra Series 2, and a two times performance increase over Intel Core Ultra Series 1.So, better computers. That's pretty par for the course for CES, but there is a \"one more thing\" here. Intel is coming for AMD's dominance in handheld gaming PCs.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Intel\n                    \n    \nUntil now, most handheld gaming PCs have used AMD chips, with those that have opted for Intel getting hit in reviews for buggy or poorly optimized performance. The Steam Deck uses an AMD chip, and so does the Xbox handheld. Intel says it's going to change that.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAfter announcing the new integrated GPU and walking through features like frame generation and ray tracing, the company said it \"will be launching an entire handheld gaming platform with Panther Lake.\"That means big moves, and soon—Panther Lake won't last long before getting replaced. The company didn't say much more, but it did show a slide with partners set to use Intel chips in their handhelds, including Acer, MSI, and hey, Microsoft. I guess we'll see another Xbox handheld model soon.And that's about it for Intel this year. The new chips are smaller, stronger, and more efficient, but smartly, the company is also planning to use them to shore up its weaknesses, specifically in gaming and battery life. That makes sense. With developers like Apple having famously ditched Intel throughout the decade, the company has been on the back foot.According to Intel, the earliest machines powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will start accepting pre-orders on January 6, with availability beginning on January 27.\n            \n    ",

At CES 2026, the company announced a new line of unobtrusive smart TVs, complete with a new brand name and a redesigned FireTV OS, which will also show up on other FireTV devices.Meet the Ember Artline TV series\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Amazon\n                    \n    \nAmazon is calling its new line of art TVs \"Ember Artline.\" They will ship in two sizes, 55 inches and 65 inches, with pricing starting at $899 for the base model—some $200 cheaper than the list price of Samsung's Frame TVs (though those models are regularly discounted on Amazon).The panels will offer 4K QLED screens with 450 nits of brightness. Because it's an art TV, there is a matte screen coating to reduce glare and make it look less like a standard TV. They also feature Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6. Design-wise, they're incredibly thin, around 1.5 inches thick.\nAmazon's big selling point here is the Ember Artline offers 10 different frame options, all of which snap on the TV with magnets. You can choose between textures and colors like Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver. In its art mode, the sets will cycle between 2,000 images of artworks, or your personal selection of photos. \"Omnisense technology\" will allow the display to turn on when anyone walks in the room, and turns off when they walk out, saving energy.And of course, this wouldn't be a CES 2026 product announcement without a bit of AI. Amazon is integrating Alexa+ into the FireTV OS on these sets, including an AI feature that will show art pieces on TV that match the decor and room that you're in (after you upload four photos taken from different angles). With an Amazon Photos connection, you can also ask Alexa+ to create slideshows from specific vacations, days, or events. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe Ember Artline lineup will start shipping sometime in spring, starting in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the U.K.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThere's also a redesigned FireTV interface\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Amazon\n                    \n    \nAlong with the new art TVs, Amazon also showed off a redesigned FireTV interface—and it looks quite a bit like Google TV. That's not a bad thing from my point-of-view; one of my biggest issues with the FireTV OS is its slow and inconsistent home page. A refresh with better organization will certainly help, and visually, it looks a lot cleaner, with rounded corners, consistent typography, and much better spacing between elements. The home screen now has tabs above to quickly switch to movies, TV show, live games, and more. You can also press and hold the Home button to open a Control Center like menu, again similar to Google TV. You will also be able to pin more apps to the home screen. Previously you were limited to six large apps. The refreshed interface has space for up to 20 apps of your choosing. The refresh will begin rolling out next month in the U.S. to the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max 2nd Gen, and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series, and will be followed by more countries down the line. It will be available on the Ember TV series at launch.\n            \n    ",

During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026. While the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.How Ford AI Assistant worksFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time. \nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.   \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWill Ford AI Assistant actually be useful?As someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.Of course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.  \n            \n    ",

That aside, the hardware seems pretty basic: The speaker has a USB-C port at the back, and two buttons up top (play/pause, and pair).Chaining together Bluetooth speakers is nothing new, but this is the first time I'm seeing the ability to pair as many as 100 of them. The only reason this use case is even remotely plausible is the pricing: As reported by The Verge, the Kallsup Bluetooth speaker will be priced at $10 in the U.S. and €5 (roughly $6) in Europe, which means you can buy 10 of them for the same price as one HomePod mini. The Verge also says  that once you pair one of them to your phone (the company promises Bluetooth 5.3 support), you can add more to the chain with a two-button sequence. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDesign-wise, the speakers are cubical and colorful, which I'm a fan of (at the moment, Ikea is showing them off  in white, green, and pink). But how do they sound? Well, Gizmodo says that while they are loud, they don't deliver much in the way of bass. I'd love to get a couple to judge for myself before committing to chaining a few dozen of them together, but I definitely  admire Ikea's big swing here. That said, while CES is the place to grab attention with out-there ideas, and I am struggling to find a use case for chaining 100 Bluetooth speakers together. Maybe if you're an amusement park owner and you want the cheapest possible audio setup for a haunted house? Likely most people will be content with a more reasonable number of them, spread around the house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.The free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.To get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.The third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.It's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can read more on the project's Github page.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I saw the company's smart pet door at the last two CES's, and was my first introduction to this specific product category. At the time, Pawport hadn't yet launched; now they have. But there's one key difference between the pet door Pawport showed off at CES 2025, and the one that eventually launched late last year.In a lot of ways, Pawport's official pet door is the product I saw last year: Pawport is made of aluminum, and is reportedly bulletproof. (The company has a model riddled with bullet holes on display). This smart door is designed to fit over an existing pet door in your home. If you don't have one, the company also sells an insert to install into your wall. It's weatherproof, has deadbolts on the top and bottom for security, and connects to smart home and voice control assistants. It can even work on battery power, though you can also plug it into power. But Pawport tells me the big change between last year's prototype and its official launch model is the technology used in the smart tag that attached to your pet's collar. Now, Pawport uses a type of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to communicate between the tag and the door. That gives the user more control over things like how far your pet has to be from the door before it opens: Maybe you prefer your dog to be two feet away inside before it opens, but five feet away when outside. Pawport says UWB also gives the door more security than before. Now, the tech enables end-to-end encryption between the dog collar and the door, so, according to the company, the door can't be hacked. It's a bold claim, but, if true, that should give pet owners some peace of mind.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            Pawport's UWB smart tag attached to a dog collar.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nPawport now also gives pet owners control over whether pets can run outside in adverse weather conditions. If there's rain or lightning, users can configure the app to lock the door from the inside, so pets can't scurry off into an unsafe backyard. That only locks one way, as well, so if the pet is already outside when the weather lock takes effect, they can still get back inside.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn addition, the company tells me that UWB has extended the battery life of the tag this go around. While the previous prototype was rated for around six months of battery life, the new model has an advertised battery life of one year, though users could see their batteries lasting up to 15 to 18 months. Pawport plans to eventually sell a dedicated outdoor pet door as well, but at the moment, it only sells the indoor unit. That starts at $599 for the company's six standard colors in their medium sized unit, and $849 for one of eight \"signature series\" designs, which adds a polished wood look to the door. You can upgrade to a large unit for another $50, or the extra large unit for an extra $100. \n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.Looking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n    \n            \n            New ROG Zephyrus Duo (left) vs. ROG Zephyrus Duo 2023 (right).\n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Asus\n                    \n    \nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.The new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.\n            \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.When it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Soundcore\n                    \n    \nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The third (and newest) generation comes with OTA updates that the AirPods Pro 2 also get to enjoy—but considering the second and third generations are the same price right now, why not go with the newer version? The AirPods Pro 3 are down to $199 (originally $249.99), which they briefly hit back in December during the holiday sales—the lowest price yet, according to price tracking tools.\nThe AirPods Pro 3 improve on already great premium earbuds with new features (like a heart rate sensor) without increasing the list price. You'll get Personalized Spatial Audio (so you can hear sounds seemingly coming from different directions as you move your head) and the ability to use head gestures to tell Siri \"yes\" or \"no\" (this also works for answering or denying calls). Apple added a live translation feature to both the second- and third-generation AirPods Pro when iOS 26 rolled out earlier this year. You'll also get features like Conversation Awareness, which lowers your music volume when your AirPods detect that you're talking to someone; Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings while your earbuds are in; and Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency mode to adjust ANC levels based on the noise around you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nSince these are in-ear earbuds (as supposed to regular earbuds like the AirPods 4) the ANC is much better since it naturally blocks out the noise with a tight seal, but the ANC technology itself has also improved—as has the sound quality, thanks to the new H3 chip, as PCMag detailed in its \"exemplary\" review, calling them the best earbuds your money can buy. You can expect about eight hours of juice, depending on your usage, and another 24 hours from the charging case. \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Steam Deck fans did take a bit of a hit towards the end of the year, when Valve announced it was discontinuing the $400 Steam Deck LCD, but for gamers on the other side of the price spectrum, Lenovo just announced the most powerful SteamOS handheld yet.It's technically not a new device, but instead, a reissue of a handheld from last year. Called the Lenovo Legion Go 2, it packs up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. It's also got detachable controllers like the Nintendo Switch, and uniquely, an 8.8-inch OLED display. And now, you can buy it with SteamOS officially installed out of the box (last year's release only came with Windows).If it's anything like the Legion Go S with SteamOS preinstalled, that means booting it up and navigating through your games will feel just like using a Steam Deck, which is great news for anyone who's a fan of Valve's lightweight and simple-to-use operating system, but is starting to feel like it might be showing its age. Not only should it prove easier to use than last year's Legion Go 2 with Windows installed on it, but the more powerful chip means the handheld will be able to play games much more smoothly and at higher resolutions than any other official SteamOS device yet. The hardware isn't made by Valve, but effectively, this is now a new, ultra-powerful Steam Deck sequel, and should be able to bump up your fps by up to dozens of frames in the right circumstances. For a measure of how transformative this can be, when the Legion Go S got SteamOS, it went from one of my least favorite handheld gaming PCs to my best pick for most people.\nEven those who already have the Windows version could see a performance increase, since SteamOS typically takes fewer resources to run than Windows, which can translate to smoother gameplay. You can see my review of the Legion Go 2 with Windows for more there, where I compare it to SteamOS devices. With this hardware combined with this operating system, this might be the most powerful handheld gaming PC you can buy right now, period.The only catch? This is still a bulky device, and while the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S saw a price cut over the Windows version (likely due to Valve not charging a licensing fee like Microsoft), the SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 actually starts off more expensive than the Windows version, at $1,199 rather than $1,099. That could be due to shortages on key components like RAM, but it is disappointing to see an already high price tag get higher when the precedent for SteamOS versions of these devices is for prices to come down.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nStill, the cheapest Windows model for the Legion Go 2 is actually a bit hard to find anywhere other than Lenovo's official store right now anyway, so it's possible that model could face its own price bumps in the near future as supply dwindles. And above four figures, one could argue that quality matters more than an extra $100 on the price tag.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGranted, you could get a Windows version and install SteamOS on it yourself, but doing so is a bit arduous, and can result in some unintuitive button mapping. The version with SteamOS installed out of the box, meanwhile, has a dedicated Steam button set-up from the get go. You'll have fewer headaches and a more intuitive setup by going for it.Aside from that button and the operating system, everything else about the device is the same as the Windows version, but that's not a bad thing. I called it \"overkill\" in my review, but that large OLED screen is gorgeous, and perfect for gamers who want the best looking graphics possible on the go. The original Legion Go 2 was my favorite premium gaming handheld of last year, and the model with SteamOS installed on it is only set to make it better.Valve gamers who think the Steam Deck OLED or Legion Go S aren't quite ritzy enough for them should stay tuned for the official release date, currently expected for June. This could be the premium handheld gaming PC they've been waiting for, marrying SteamOS convenience with modern specs that even the similarly priced Xbox handheld can't match. Finally, there's a \"Steam Deck\" for the 1%.\n            \n    ",

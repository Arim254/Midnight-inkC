However, sometimes less is more, as I'll get to below. Sadly, it seems Google is less keen on Chromebooks than I am. The last Google-made Pixelbook launched in 2019, and it's been left to the likes of Asus, Acer, HP, Samsung, and others to keep new Chromebooks coming in. If you're reading, Google, it's high time we had a new Pixelbook.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nChromebooks cut down on the clutterThere is the argument that Windows and macOS give you the Chrome browser plus a lot more, but most of the time, I don't really need the \"more\"—unless I've got some detailed image edits to do, or want to play some games. Almost everything I need runs on the web.There are a lot fewer software updates, background programs, app assistants, and system utilities to think about. While ChromeOS does have updates, they're mostly done seamlessly in the background, and applied whenever you next reboot your Chromebook.Another chore I don't have to regularly take care of on my Chromebook is tidying up the desktop or my local folders, because there isn't really anything to download, save, or sync. The laptop file system and internal storage is tidier by default, because I never use it.Chromebooks save everything instantly\n    \n            \n            No save button required.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAll the work I do on my Chromebook is inside a browser, and usually inside Google apps like Google Docs and Gmail. That means everything is instantly saved—should a power cut or a system crash happen, I don't have to worry about losing what I've been working on.I don't need to check for open programs and files in the background that I might have forgotten about, and if I need to jump up and do something else quickly, I can just shut my laptop and I'm done—I'm not clicking through dozens of save dialogs first.Chromebooks put everything on the webWhen you're working inside web apps all the time, without the option of locally installed tools, syncing is seamless. To work on a document that I need to access across Windows and macOS, for example, I need to think about saving, syncing, and app compatibility.When I'm working in Google Docs in a Chromebook, everything syncs automatically. I can even have a document open simultaneously across ChromeOS, Windows, and macOS, and jump between them as needed to make edits—something which saves a lot of time.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChromebooks tie in tightly to the Google ecosystem\n    \n            \n            Android phones and Chromebooks play nicely together.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI can understand that Chromebooks may have less appeal if you're not always using Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Google Docs, Chrome, and everything else Google makes—but for someone heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (like me), they make a lot of sense.If you've got an Android phone, for example, you can use it to set up a Chromebook, share files across both devices, respond to text messages from ChromeOS, and get hotspot access with a click. There's a level of integration you don't get on other platforms.Chromebooks actually work as distraction-free devicesOne of the criticisms leveled at Chromebooks is that they're pretty much useless without an internet connection, but that's only partly true. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and even Gmail actually work perfectly well offline now.If I'm traveling without steady wifi, I enjoy using my Chromebook as a distraction-free device, getting through a ton of writing and email replying without constantly switching tabs. When wifi returns, everything I've done gets synced back to the web automatically. While we're on the subject of ChromeOS being useless when it's not online, I think it's fair to say internet access is almost ubiquitous now (via public wifi or phone hotspots), and that Windows and macOS aren't particularly useful either when the web is cut off.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Apple's distinct new design language has been met with praise and criticism, with some users enjoying the refreshed look, and others bemoaning the UI's issues with visibility and consistency.  It seems Apple was similarly of two minds on the update, having toyed around with the exact look of Liquid Glass throughout the iOS 26 beta testing period. The company seemed to be having trouble settling on a specific balance between the design's glassy effect, which can look really cool, and its overall readability. If buttons are too clear, for example, they'll let in more of the background elements, which can make it more difficult to see them. But by reducing the glass effect too much by adding a tint to the icon and menu backgrounds, Apple risks loses the charm of the design entirely. (Some critics have dubbed it \"Frosted Glass\" by comparison.)While Apple is seemingly still continuing to tweak Liquid Glass, it appears the company has decided that part of the problem is down to user preference. So rather than stick with one look for the design, Apple now lets you choose whether Liquid Glass looks more clear, or more tinted.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo be clear, or not to be clearThis new setting came as a bit of a surprise. Apple did not roll it out until the fourth beta for iOS 26.1 and macOS 26.1, only two weeks before the updates' official release. The toggle, which you can find in Settings > Display and Brightness (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings > Appearance on the Mac (macOS), gives users a simple choice in how Liquid Glass looks across their particular system: \"Clear,\" which is more transparent, and is in-line with Liquid Glass' original intent; or \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of menus and windows. You'll likely be able to read these elements better, but you won't see as much of the background shining through. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \"Clear\" (left) vs. \"Tinted\" (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGiving users what they asked for (sort of)During the pre-release beta testing period, some users called on Apple to add a Liquid Glass \"slider\" to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The idea was to allow users to fine-tune how Liquid Glass looks. Apple seems to have taken a different approach, offering only two levels of transparency with the new control. While a slider (or more transparency options, at least) would be great, what we're getting is better than nothing for users who prefer a more opaque Liquid Glass appearance.Before Apple added this dedicated settings page, there was a workaround you can use to \"undo\" Liquid Glass: By kicking on the \"Reduce Transparency\" feature in Accessibility settings, you could achieve a similar look to choosing the new \"Tinted\" option. I think you'll find that \"Tinted\" will achieve a more visually pleasing look, however, as it is something Apple deliberately implemented to work with the design of Liquid Glass, while reduce Transparency is simply a blanket effect that turns down transparency effects across iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

It all started last week, when Disney pulled its channels from YouTube TV, Google's Live TV service, over fee disputes. Now, Disney seems to be pulling content from other Google services as well. As first noted by 9to5Google, Disney movies are starting to disappear from YouTube's pay-per-view offerings too, and even other platforms like Google TV.For instance, try typing \"Avengers\" into your YouTube search bar right now. Aside from trailers and videos uploaded from individual users, you're more likely to see a rental option pop up for that 1998 Sean Connery and Uma Thurman spy movie than Marvel's superheroes. Meanwhile, Superman, a Warner Bros. movie, has a large \"Buy or rent\" button right at the top of the page.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe same goes for Lilo & Stitch. Currently, YouTube shows no option to buy or rent either the original Lilo & Stitch or its remake, but pay-per-view buttons for Dreamworks family movie The Bad Guys 2 show up front and center at the top of the page, just like with Superman. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nEven movies from Disney subsidiaries seem to be affected. While I was able to navigate to a rental page for Alien, which is now owned by Disney after its acquisition of Fox, I couldn't actually go through with purchasing the movie. Instead, I just saw a message saying, \"This video contains content from Fox. It is not available.\"\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI ran into the same issues trying to find these movies on other Google services, like Google TV (which also offers rentals, much like Apple TV) or the Play Store, but notably, all of the movies listed above are available on non-Google platforms, like Prime Video. Even older \"Disney Vault\" titles, like the original The Little Mermaid, are on Prime, but are nowhere to be seen on Google's services.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI've reached out to both Disney and Google for comment, and will update when I hear back. In the meantime, neither company has made an official statement about this seeming pay-per-view content blockade.My two cents? It's a negotiation tactic. YouTube's pay-per-view offerings are a separate service entirely from YouTube TV, and are thus likely unaffected by that platform's licensing deals. At the same time, in pulling more of its content from Google's other platforms, Disney can exert additional leverage on Google to pay up to stream its channels.It's not the only mind game going on right now, for what it's worth. At time of writing, it's currently the first major election day in the U.S. since last year's presidential election, and yesterday, Disney offered to temporarily return ABC to YouTube TV so viewers could keep up with the news. YouTube rejected the proposal, saying it would \"cause customer confusion\" and instead proposed that Disney \"immediately restore\" ABC and ESPN while negotiations continue, as a sign of good faith.\"Those are the channels that people want,\" YouTube said, implying that it is being overcharged for additional channels that viewers show little interest in. The company then said that if Disney is willing to play ball, it can \"get these channels live in hours.\"That's certainly more heated than we've seen past YouTube TV negotiations, which were largely settled before customers saw any impact, get. While it's possible Disney might actually take YouTube up on its offer, we're probably not out of the woods yet. Luckily for YouTube TV subscribers, YouTube is promising remediation if the situation drags on any further, and some have even started to see it. As someone who doesn't subscribe to YouTube TV but does rent movies through YouTube, though? I have to admit I feel a little caught in the crossfire.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

In fact, it seems most of the work Apple does on AI is behind the scenes: While Apple Intelligence is, well, there, the company's researchers are working on other ways to improve AI models for everyone, not just Apple users. The latest project? Improving AI image editors based on text prompts. In a paper published last week, researchers introduced Pico-Banana-400K, a dataset of 400,000 \"text-guided\" images selected to improve AI-based image editing. Apple believes its image dataset improves upon existing sets by including higher quality images with more diversity: The researchers found that existing datasets either use images produced by AI models, or are not varied enough, which can hinder efforts to improve the models.Funnily enough, Pico-Banana-400K is designed to work with Nano Banana, Google's image editing model. Researchers say using Nano Banana, their dataset can generate 35 different types of edits, as well as tap into Gemini-2.5-Pro to asses quality the edits, and whether those edits should remain as part of the overall dataset.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs part of these 400,000 images, there are 258,000 samples of single edits (where Apple compares the original images to one with edits); 56,000 \"preference pairs,\" which distinguishes between failed and successful edit generations; and 72,000 \"multi-turn sequences,\" which walks through two to five edits.Researchers note that different functions had different success rates in this dataset. Global edits and stylization are \"easy,\" achieving the highest success rates; object semantics and scene context are \"moderate;\" while precise geometry, layout, and typography are \"hard.\" The highest performing function, \"strong artistic style transfer,\" which could include changing an image's style to \"Van Gogh\" or anime, has a 93% success rate. The lowest performing function, \"change font style or color of visible text if there is text,\" only succeeded 58% of the time. Other tested functions include \"add new text\" (67% success rate), \"zoom in\" (74% success rate), and \"add film grain or vintage filter\" (91% success rate).  Unlike many of Apple's products, which are typically closed to the company's own platforms, Pico-Banana-400K is open for all researchers and AI developers to use. It's cool to see Apple researchers contributing to open research like this, especially in an area Apple is generally behind in. Will we actually get an AI-powered Siri anytime soon? Unclear. But it is clear Apple is actively working on AI, perhaps just in its own way. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Some methods are adaptable, open to interpretation, and fluid, which is nice if you just need a little guidance. Others, though, are detailed and rule-driven, which is great if you need to be told exactly what to do and when to do it. Agile Results, a system devised by J. D. Meier, is in the second category; it's stricter than others, but for some of us, that's what's needed to get things done. With Agile Results, you schedule and plan around all your goals, from the short- to long-term, so everything gets taken care of—even the biggest big-picture tasks. Here’s how it works.What is the Agile Results method?Meier describes Agile Results as “a results-driven system that helps you get meaning, momentum, and mastery in all areas of your life.” That’s an optimistic, lofty tagline, but in essence, it just boils down to getting more serious with your goal-setting and planning.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nYou’ll focus on “three wins” at every level, from daily up to yearly. (“Wins” are really another words for your goals, but when you say \"wins,\" it implies you already expect to meet them, which sets a certain tone.) First, set three “wins” as goals for your entire year. This can be on the first of a new year or any time as long as you’re looking ahead a full 365 days and your goals are designed to be met within that time period. These are obviously your biggest, most overarching goals—the ones that will take a lot of steps and effort between today and this time next year to turn into true \"wins.\"Next, set quarterly goals. These are the big goals that are going to lead into the annual ones and can be set on the first day of the quarter, if you’re starting on January 1, or every three months if you’re starting at another time. If you're having a hard time determining what should be a quarterly goal, try mind-mapping to help you visualize your larger projects and all the elements that go into them. From there, set monthly goals related to those. In general, it’s best to start this method on the first of a month, just to give it a structure that will be easy to follow, but again, you can do this whenever you want—as long as the goals you list here are the kind that are doable within about four weeks and add up toward the completion of the quarterly and annual wins.After that, set weekly goals every Monday and daily goals every morning, minimizing the size of the goals with each until you’ve created a system of daily building blocks that lead up to weekly wins, weekly tasks that lead up to monthly wins, monthly goals that lead up to quarterly wins, etc. This is where it gets hard to follow, so initially, set a reminder in your phone for each morning (and two for Mondays) that will spur you to create the smaller goals. You can add this into to-do apps you already use. My favorite is Finch, where I can set goals that recur on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, and am rewarded with cute in-app animations when I mark them off, but if you need something else, try some of these. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNo matter how you go about it, schedule 10 minutes every morning to set your daily goals, allowing 15 to 20 minutes on days that will see you structuring weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual goals. Keep in mind that these are supposed to be structured and organized, so you should rely on a planner or easily accessible document to get it done. I recommend using Google Sheets and setting aside a designated sheet for each set of goals within a single workbook. Using a cloud-based software instead of Excel or similar will make it easy to pull up the goals wherever you are.Take this part seriously. The conscious process of setting the goals isn't something to rush through. Use time blocking and time boxing to designate specific times to do it—and stick to those times. Finally, make sure the wins—from daily to annual—are concrete. I recommend using SMART goals to write detailed, thoughtful assertions about what your goals are, as they help you stick to a schedule and stay realistic. Reviewing is key to Agile ResultsSetting aside time every morning to write down your goals is essential, but so, too, is setting aside time every afternoon to review your progress. Every day, reflect on how you did with your daily goals. Every Friday, expand your reflection time to include your weekly goals and, at the end of each month, make sure you’re reviewing your monthly goals, too. Keep this going all the way to the end of the year, when you should be able to look back and see how far you came in reaching your annual “wins.” Meier suggests that on Fridays, you take time to write down three things that are going well and three things that need improvement. Here's where you can borrow the idea of the after-action review from the Army; you need to identify what went wrong and what went right so you can stay on the right track. This reflection is key in helping you craft the next set of daily and weekly “wins.” Giving yourself time to focus on the successes instead of just identifying problem areas will also keep you motivated, so be sure to write down your reflections somewhere in your planner or document. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

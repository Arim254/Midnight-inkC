Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        If you've booked a hotel through a platform like Booking.com or Expedia, beware any communication that directs you to confirm your payment details to hold your reservation. Threat actors are targeting the hospitality industry with a phishing campaign designed to steal from travelers. As outlined by security firm Sekoia.io and reported by The Hacker News, the scheme is referred to as \"I Paid Twice\" because hotel customers are eventually conned into handing over their banking information. Scammers contact guests via WhatsApp or email about their booking, saying that they need to verify their payment or risk cancellation. The link goes to a fake landing page that looks like Booking.com or Expedia, where victims are prompted to provide card information. This isn't the first scam to target Booking.com: Scammers have previously spoofed the site to spread malware directly to users via both fake CAPTCHAs and homograph attacks, which exploit similar characters in the URL to redirect to a malicious website. \nThis multi-step campaign actually begins when hackers target hotels themselves with ClickFix attacks, a type of social engineering attack designed to trick users into downloading malware via fake error messages or CAPTCHA forms. (I've covered a handful of ClickFix schemes, such as those spread via AI-generated instructional videos on TikTok and expired invite links on Discord.) The scam runs as follows: Hotel managers receive emails from compromised accounts with phishing links that redirect to a supposed reCAPTCHA page. This is the ClickFix component, as targets are instructed to complete the challenge to \"ensure the security of your connection.\" A couple of redirects lead to the user copy and execute a PowerShell command that downloads a Remote Access Trojan (like PureRAT) to their device. Once the malware has been delivered, it allows threat actors remote access, including control of the mouse and keyboard, data exfiltration, command execution, file uploads and downloads, keylogging, and webcam and microphone capture. Hackers are then able to steal admin credentials to gain access to booking platforms and send the aforementioned phishing emails to hotel guests—or they can sell the information to other cybercriminals. Don't fall for the hotel booking scamYou can't control whether a hotel manager unwittingly hands over access to your booking information. But you can avoid further compromising your personal and financial data by staying vigilant to any unexpected communication about your reservation. A reputable hotel probably won't contact you via a booking platform (nor will the platform itself) to demand payment for holding a reservation you've already confirmed. This sense of urgency is meant to trick you into acting quickly, so if you're not sure what's going on, call the hotel directly using the number on their official website (not from the email or WhatsApp message). Don't click any links, and don't enter any information unless you have confirmed that you are on a legitimate booking platform or hotel website. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Holiday shopping season is ripe for scammers, as consumers rush to find and take advantage of some of the best discounts of the year, and potentially overlook red flags that signal fraud. Security researchers are warning of an uptick in scams capitalizing on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype. Fraudsters know that they can prey on shoppers' sense of urgency and excitement for limited-time, exclusive deals—and AI is making these campaigns even more difficult to spot than usual. New data from McAfee suggest that nearly half of Americans have come across an AI-powered scam while shopping, from deepfakes impersonating celebrities pushing promotions to near-flawless spoofed websites that steal your credit card information. Here are the scams to watch for this Black Friday. \nSpoofed websites are a common type of a scam, and fraudsters use holiday shopping season to trap users with fake retail sites and sales pages that look legitimate but are actually just collecting data like your login credentials and payment information. Scammers will use stolen assets like logos and product photos from known and trusted brands, and AI makes it easy to set up a convincing (but fake) small business website with elements like a customer service page and consumer reviews in no time. Another shopping scam facilitated by AI is the impersonation scam. You think you're watching a popular influencer or celebrity promoting an exclusive deal or product giveaway on TikTok or another social media platform, but it's actually a deepfake. If you click through to enter or buy, you'll land on a counterfeit page (as outlined above) designed to steal from you. According to Google's November fraud and scam advisory, scammers can get eyes on their content by hijacking search terms for Black Friday sales, running deceptive ads, or pushing deals on social media. Fake storefronts may appear as sponsored links, which are easy to overlook if you're in a rush to make a purchase. Of course, you may encounter other common holiday scams, such as fake shipping notifications that request payment in order to resolve a delivery issue as well as account verification scams that prompt you to confirm personal details. These phishing and smishing campaigns use standard scam tactics like impersonating a legitimate company or service and sending a fraudulent link that collects your bank information or username and password combination. Black Friday scam red flags When shopping holiday deals, slow down enough to look for common signs of scams. Fraudsters will use urgency—such as a limited time to secure a deal or a limited number of items left in stock—in hopes you won't think before you buy. You should also be wary of any deal that is too good to be true, or a promotion with especially low prices that are out of line with other sales on similar items. This includes influencers pushing \"exclusive\" opportunities. If you are purchasing from a small business you don't know, google the brand and read third-party reviews to see whether it is legitimate. Instead of clicking links from emails, texts, and social media posts promoting sales, go directly to the retailer's website and search for the deal. If you do click through, check the URL carefully to ensure it is legitimate (scammers may use homoglyphs that avoid detection at first glance) and look for website elements that real companies have, such as a privacy policy and address. If you see a promotion on social media, check the creator's account to see when they joined the platform, what they've posted in the past, and whether they are verified. Beware of any site that requires you to pay with a gift card, cryptocurrency, or bank transfer versus a credit card, which has some protection in the case of fraud. Legitimate retailers will use legitimate payment methods. Finally, never enter your login credentials unless you've confirmed that the site you're using is trustworthy. This includes delivery services and your Amazon and PayPal accounts, all of which scammers may pressure you to \"verify\" in order to resolve a billing or delivery issue. \n            ",

From roof leaks to burst pipes—water damage is the second-most claimed loss on home insurance policies, just below “wind and hail.” In fact, there are way more losses due to water damage than fire.And the most troubling aspect of water damage is how silent it can be. You can have a leak for a long time before the damage becomes bad enough to notice. And even if you know you have a water leak somewhere, locating it can often be difficult because water can travel a long way from the source before making its presence known. That’s why you need these five kinds of leak detectors on hand, so you’ll know when a damaging water leak erupts, and be able to find it quickly to minimize the damage.Moisture alarmsStep one is to have water detectors with alarms set up around the house in places where leaks are probable. These alarms are typically wifi-connected and simply detect moisture beyond a normal level, ringing out an audible alarm and sending a message to your devices warning you of a leak. Having them placed in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, basements, attics, and anywhere else where the home comes into contact with water means leaks will be noticed right away instead of slowly destroying your property over weeks, months, or even years.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThese alarms can often be combined with networked shutoff valves that will automatically turn off the water supply when a leak is detected. That way, even if you’re not home, the damage from a leak will be minimized.Moisture meterAs useful as leak alarms are, they can only help if present where a water leak occurs—and they only tell you that there’s water, not where the water is coming from. Sometimes the source will be obvious, of course—if the alarm placed near your toilet goes off, chances are good that it’s your toilet doing the leaking. But if the leak begins with a pipe in your wall, one tiny spot on a large roof system, or underground, you’ll need some help locating it.A moisture meter is a must-have for finding leaks. It’s a simple device that measures the amount of moisture trapped in a material, like drywall or flooring. By taking multiple readings throughout an area, you can pinpoint where the water is concentrated before you start tearing things open to effect a repair, saving you time and money.EndoscopesSometimes you need to see inside the spaces and voids of your home to find a water leak. If you suspect a pipe is leaking in the walls, for example, and you’re getting some confusing moisture meter readings, it might be time to reach for one of the most useful tools you’ll ever own: an endoscopic camera (aka, a borescope). This is a small, flexible camera that can be inserted into a small space and fished around, allowing you to see what’s behind a wall, under a floor, or inside a soffit in your home without ripping everything open. If there’s no obvious way to insert the camera, you can usually drill a small access hole that can be easily repaired later, and the video feed will let you inspect all those pipes to see where the water’s coming from.Pipe locatorA pipe locator is exactly what it sounds like: It locates the hidden pipes feeding water into and taking water out of your house, which are often inside walls, under floors, or buried underground. If you’re trying to figure out where a leaking pipe might be located, this tool can be invaluable, especially if other options haven’t worked.They’re not cheap—this one from Rigid is one of the more affordable options, and it’s about $1,800 at the time of this writing. But you can easily spend $1,000 or more if a plumber comes out to locate and fix your leaking pipe, so if you’re comfortable fixing the leak yourself, a tool like this will pay for itself eventually because you’ll be able to isolate the leak, turn off water to just that area, and effect the repair.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n            Features editor\n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.If I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Another important—but perhaps more overlooked—element of the productivity process is the assessment, however. Reviewing what you did is just as integral as planning how you’ll do it—in reviewing, you get a chance to plan better (and improve!) for next time, while also carving out space to appreciate what you did well—also a major motivator!What is an after-action review? An after-action review, or AAR, is a way to measure the results of your performance and improve on your processes. It was first introduced by the U.S. Army to give units feedback after they had collective training exercises. The Army has actually released a ton of literature on it, but all you need to know is that when carried out right, it’s standardized, done the same way every time, and useful for building a framework that can enhance future labor. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIf you do end up diving into that mountain of literature on the AAR, you’ll notice that it was designed for units or teams and is typically conducted by a facilitator who encourages members to discuss each part of the effort with the group. But it can be useful for individuals, too, since the process of completing an AAR is standardized and easy to follow. Build time into your schedule to conduct your own personal AAR after completing a major project, whether at work or in your personal life. You can complete it at the end of every week, or once you've finished a specific project. Either way, you'll want to keep notes of these reviews, whether in your planner or in a document you can add to a larger file about the project, like a single source of truth (SSOT). You may feel silly \"reviewing\" work you just completed, but the arguments for it—and the potential benefits—are substantial. First, if you're honest with yourself about what went wrong, you can figure out why the parts that didn't work were inefficient or ineffective, then seek solutions. In identifying what went well, you can set plans to replicate your process in the future, and find a little motivation in a job well done. An AAR (or something similar) is an integral part of many popular productivity techniques, including Getting Things Done and Agile Results. All the planning in the world doesn't matter if you never reflect on how it all went so you can improve next time around. What you should put into your after-action reviewThis is where we get into the rigid, structured process of the Army. There are four questions you’ll ask yourself when conducting your AAR and they’ll always be the same: \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat did I intend to accomplish?What did I do?Why did it happen the way it did?What will I do to change my strategy or execution for a better outcome next time OR how can I duplicate my success?Essentially, consider what you wanted to get done, what you actually got done, what impacted the outcome, and what you can take away for future attempts. Even running over this checklist in your head is a good practice, but writing it down is best, so you can refer back to it next time you’re in the planning stages on a new project. For instance, say you want to clean your kitchen. That’s the answer to the first question. What you really did, whether it was clean the kitchen, avoid the task, or only give it a half-effort, is the answer to the second. The third question is where you get introspective: If you did clean the kitchen, was it because you had company coming over and felt a sense of urgency, aligning your productivity with the Yerkes-Dodson Law? Or maybe it was because you needed to feel a sense of accomplishment after an otherwise unproductive week, but you were so burned out that you didn't do a great job. If you didn’t clean, was it because you felt overwhelmed? Did you get too busy? Did you lack the right tools for the job? Once you’ve established your reasons, you can build them into the answer to the fourth question, writing something like, “I will clean my kitchen weekly to make sure I’m always ready for unexpected company,” “I will follow a regimented cleaning method to avoid feeling overwhelmed,” or, “I will invest in better cleaning tools to make the next attempt go smoother.” When cleaning time rolls around again, you’ll pre-plan your actions as normal, scheduling out time for the activity and setting goals. Refer back to your AAR to refresh your memory on what went right and what went wrong the last time you tried to do the task. Eventually, you’ll smooth out the issues that are preventing you from being most efficient and get more results. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

But even when you know what tasks need to be done, you still need to figure out how to prioritize them, so you can tackle them in the right order while giving each the amount of attention and resources they actually need. Here's where you can use the 3-3-3 method.What is the 3-3-3 method?This technique comes from Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals. He advocates planning each workday around a 3-3-3 model:First devote three hours to deep work on your most important project. Next, complete three other urgent tasks that don’t require three hours of focus. Finally, do three “maintenance” tasks, like cleaning, answering emails, or scheduling other work. Other productivity techniques, like the pomodoro method, call for you to engage in deep work, or completely uninterrupted work with no distractions, so consider tapping into one of those first three hours if you want to make the most of a 3-3-3 approach.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo figure out which of the above categories a task fits into, I recommend a prioritization method like the Eisenhower matrix, which involves using a quadrant system to divvy up your responsibilities by urgency and importance. You'll want to consider not only how timely the things you need to do are, but also how many resources they'll consume. Remember not to overestimate the amount of time your tasks will take you—the longer you give yourself to work on something, the more you'll naturally drag out your work, which hampers productivity. Be firm with yourself when deciding how long to allot for a major, resource-heavy task.If you don't consider yourself a morning person and aren't sure you can jump into a heavy workload right away in the day, it's not necessarily a problem. I've written about the value of eating the frog—or, rather, tackling your biggest task of the day right away when you get up, which is a part of the traditional 3-3-3 structure—and though I've tried it myself, I'm just not that kind of person. It doesn't mean I can't work within a 3-3-3 framework, so don't feel like you can't, either. Play around with the technique, maybe by starting later in the morning and pushing your lunch back. I find this approach helpful because, truthfully, I really only buckle down around 10:30 every day. Because I am a slower person in the morning, I rearrange my 3-3-3s, tackling maintenance tasks earlier in the day, which keeps me feeling motivated and productive—getting things like answering emails out of the way clears my mind so I can focus on my bigger tasks more easily later.The key to succeeding with a technique like this isn't forcing yourself to fit a mold, but molding the method to your own best working habits, giving yourself a little extra structure, within reason. The goal here is to be discerning about what you take on in a day and work in the right order to maximize productivity, but you have a little wiggle room, so try a few approaches to your schedule to see what works.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy the 3-3-3 method worksWhat distinguishes this method from other productivity hacks are those three hours of deep work. Usually, jumping into them first means you’ll be fresh, focused, and more likely to be able to focus on a task without getting distracted. Regardless of if you stick to the traditional structure of doing three hours of deep work first in your day or mess with the 3-3-3 schedule, make sure to keep those three hours free of emails, texts, chit-chat, or other menial duties, to the best of your ability. Deep work yields major productivity, so you’ll get a lot accomplished if you commit to it, but you can’t stay in that mindset forever. You’ll top out after about three hours, so it’s best to have those three other, smaller tasks lined up and ready to go so you can stay productive even while downshifting into less demanding responsibilities. After three hours in the zone, you should find that those tasks are easier.Finally, your maintenance tasks give you a chance to get things done while giving your brain a rest. Use your maintenance time to prepare for the following day’s work, put finishing touches on whatever you were working on during those three hours of intense focus, or, like me, get the most boring things over with so you can think about something else.You can use this technique to tackle seven different tasks of varying urgency levels or to break one major project down into smaller chunks, depending on what your day needs. Just be sure to stick with the process.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Contactless payment, also known as tap-to-pay, has become a fast, easy, and relatively common way to complete a transaction using your smartphone or credit card. It relies on Near Field Communication (NFC) to transmit data between your device and a payment terminal when the two are in close proximity, up to an inch or two away.While NFC technology does provide some additional security—transmitting a virtual account number instead of your actual card details, for example—scammers have found a way to capitalize on tap-to-pay to steal money from unsuspecting targets. These \"ghost tapping\" schemes may exploit both cards and mobile wallets. How tap-to-pay scams workAccording to the Better Business Bureau, ghost tapping takes advantage of a potential victim's proximity and lack of attention to detail. They suggest it is possible for a scammer to bump into you in a crowded public space, getting close enough to trigger a contactless transaction without your knowledge. (It's not clear how common a close brush with a tap-to-pay machine actually is.) \nBut other versions of ghost tapping rely on you to actively engage while missing the warning signs of fraud. For example, scammers might appear to be selling goods or collecting small donations for charity using tap-to-pay, but they are actually charging your card for a much larger amount to a fraudulent business. They count on you not to look closely at the transaction details before tapping, or they rush you through the process and fail to offer a receipt.  In one instance reported to the BBB's Scam Tracker, individuals were targeted by a door-to-door salesman who claimed to be selling chocolate for a charitable cause. The transactions were for hundreds of dollars, which the victims didn't see before tapping. As with any scam, vigilance is key. Tap-to-pay is easy enough to feel automatic, and you may be less likely to pause and check the details than you would when swiping or entering your credit card. Always slow down and confirm the merchant name and transaction and tip amount before pulling out your phone or card (again, close proximity is enough to trigger tap-to-pay). Beware of any vendor who tries to rush you, hide the screen, or avoid giving you a receipt. You may also want to set up transaction alerts with your bank or credit card company so you can catch any suspicious charges immediately. If you get a notification about a \"test\" charge, that is also a scam red flag. Finally, while scammers probably aren't going around secretly scanning tap-to-pay en masse, you could protect your cards using a radio frequency identification (RFID)-blocking wallet or sleeve. You can disable NFC on your Android in Settings (type \"NFC\" into the search bar). On iPhone, you have to turn on Airplane Mode to block NFC. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Google is adding one of the iPhone's most controversial features to its latest Pixel phones, but it's promising to show a bit more restraint than Apple did. Yes, as part of the November 2025 Pixel feature drop, Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones (excluding the Pixel 9a) are getting AI notification summaries.The problem with AI notification summariesIf you're reeling back after reading that, I don't blame you. This is one of the few AI features Apple beat Google to the punch on, and when they came out during the iOS 18.3 beta, the summaries were quickly criticized for handling hard topics like breakups with a cold tone, as well as for misreporting the news.Apple quickly pulled news summaries (although they've since come back) and made it clearer when an AI was writing a notification, but it seems Google's still being a bit more cautious with its launch.\nHow AI Notification Summaries on Pixel work\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nRather than trying to organize every notification you might get, Google's AI Summaries are just starting off with popular chat apps for now, including its own Messages app and alternatives like WhatsApp. Additionally, they'll only kick in on \"longer chats,\" with the idea being to give you, \"digestible conversation recaps.\" That means you're going to see far fewer AI notifications than on the iPhone, which currently uses them for news, entertainment, chats, email, and more. That's probably a safer approach for Google, but it does mean the AI summaries are meant to be used more to get you quickly back up to speed, rather than for organization (although that will change in the future).As on the iPhone, AI notification summaries on the Pixel will be indicated by a small icon with a sparkle and a few lines below it, with the summary following. They'll also be italicized for additional visual distinction.How to turn on AI Notification Summaries on PixelGoogle is also exercising caution by making its AI notification summaries entirely opt-in. That means you'll need to manually turn them on before you start seeing them, which you can do under Settings > Notifications > Notification Summaries. While on this page, you'll also be able to exclude certain apps from sending AI notification summaries, by adding them to the \"Don't include these apps\" list.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're still not seeing the summaries after enabling them, ensure your Android System Intelligence is enabled under Settings > Notifications > Privacy > Notification read, reply & control. Additionally, summaries will not be generated while your phone is in battery saver mode, or while you're actively using it (per Google, for them to kick in, \"the screen must be off for a moment\").When will my Pixel get AI Notification Summaries?AI Notification summaries start rolling out today, alongside the November system patch. However, they're not automatically included in the downloadable patch, so it might be a while before you see them (I don't have them yet).It's still not a bad idea to get your phone fully up-to-date in the meantime. To download the November 2025 Pixel update, either wait for a notification from Google, or head to Settings > System > Software updates to manually check if it's been rolled out to you yet.What's next for Pixel's AI Notification Summaries?While today's update is clearly just Google dipping its toes in the water, the company does have bigger plans for December, where some Pixels will also start automatically silencing \"lower-priority notifications\" and will start automatically sorting them into categories like \"News\" and \"Promotions.\" Hopefully, Google will have learned some lessons from Apple by the time those features go live.\n            ",

It’s in your Gmail, it’s on your phone, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now rolling out to everyone—and getting a bunch of new features, too.If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select Gemini in Chrome to turn it on, assuming you want to.How to use Gemini in ChromeWhen you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAdditionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.More AI browsing is comingGoogle says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first. For now, Gemini in Chrome will start suggesting questions to ask it about whatever page you’re on, right in the address bar.The update includes a few security updates too, although they mostly seem to work in the backend, supposedly using AI to better block scammy ads and notifications. Now that’s the type of AI integration I can support wholeheartedly.How to turn off Gemini in ChromeAll that said, if you’re a bit skeptical about Gemini in Chrome, you can turn it off. Simply navigate to Settings > AI Innovations, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut. You can also restrict its permissions: Set everything to off, and it’ll be like it was never installed in the first place.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nNote, however, that if you're on a managed account, you might not see the menu. That's the case for one of my coworkers, but the solution there is simple. Right-click the Gemini icon and click \"unpin,\" and you won't see it anymore. However, you won't have the same controls over Gemini in Chrome's permissions here as you would when banishing it through the AI Innovations menu. Unpinning the feature will instead simply hide it, so to get rid of it further, you'll need to contact your account manager.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

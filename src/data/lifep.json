videos are getting</a>. What's even scarier, however, is how accessible the tools to create these videos are. Using something like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-we-know-about-openais-tiktok-for-ai\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI's Sora app</a>, people can create hyper-realistic short-form videos of just about anything they wantâ<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-stop-deepfakes-on-sora\" target=\"_blank\">including real people</a>, like celebrities, friends, or even themselves. </p><p>OpenAI knows the risks involved with an app that makes generating realistic videos this easy. As such, the company places a watermark on any Sora generation you create via the app. That way, when you're scrolling throughout your social media feeds, if you see a little Sora logo with a cute cloud with eyes bouncing around, you know it's AI-generated.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"you-cant-trust-a-sora-watermark\">You can't trust a Sora watermark</h2><p>My immediate worry when OpenAI announced this app was that people would find a way to remove the watermark, sowing confusion across the internet. I wasn't wrong: <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/sora-2-watermark-removers-flood-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">There are already plenty of options out there</a> for interested parties who want to make their AI slop even more realistic. But what I didn't expect was the opposite: people who want to <em>add </em>the Sora watermark to real videos, to make them look as if they were created with AI. </p><p>I was recently scrollingâor, perhaps, doomscrollingâon X when I started seeing some of these videos, like <a href=\"https://x.com/riomadeit/status/1976106455813029942\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">this one featuring Apple executive Craig Federighi</a>: The post says \"sora is getting so good,\" and includes the Sora watermark, so I assumed someone made a cameo of Federighi in the app and posted it on X. To my surprise, however, the video is simply pulled from one of Apple's pre-recorded WWDC eventsâone where Federighi parkours around Apple HQ.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"https://x.com/theo/status/1976026324008566816\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">I saw this clip</a>, which also uses a Sora watermark. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking it's an OpenAI product. But look closer, and you can tell the clip uses real people: The shots are too perfect, without the fuzziness or glitching that you tend to see from AI video generation. This clip is simply spoofing the way Sora tends to generate multi-shot clips of people talking. (Astute viewers may also notice the watermark is a little larger and more static than the real Sora watermark.)</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theo/status/1976026324008566816\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As it turns out, the account that posted that second clip <a href=\"https://x.com/theo/status/1976096703603458370\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">also made a tool</a> for adding a Sora watermark to any video. They don't explain the thinking or purpose behind the tool, but it's definitely real. And even if this tool didn't exist, I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to edit a Sora watermark into a video, especially if you weren't concerned about replicating the movement of Sora's official watermark. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>To be clear, people were already posting like this before adding the watermark tool. The joke is to say you made something with Sora, but post a popular or infamous clipÂ insteadâsay, <a href=\"https://x.com/tervisscoot/status/1976018927357657178\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Drake's Sprite ad from 15 years ago</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/Andr3jH/status/1973171921899626966\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Taylor Swift dancing at The Eras Tour</a>, or <a href=\"https://x.com/DeREALBeug/status/1974883225282793721\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">an entire <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movie</a>. It's a funny meme, especially when it's obvious that the video <em>wasn't</em> made by Sora. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tervisscoot/status/1976018927357657178\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"real-or-not-real\">Real or not real?</h2><p>But this is an important reminder to be constantly vigilant when scrolling through videos on your feeds. You have to be on the lookout for both clips that aren't real, as well as clips that are actually real, but are being advertised as AI-generated. There are a lot of implications here. Sure, it's funny to slap a Sora watermark on a viral video, but what happens when someone adds the watermark to a real video of illegal activity? \"Oh, that video isn't real. Any videos you see of it without the watermark were tampered with.\"</p><p>At the moment, it doesn't seem like anyone has figured out how to perfectly replicate the Sora watermark, so there will be signs if someone actually tries to pass a real video off as AI. But this is still all a bit concerning, and I don't know what the solution could be. Maybe we're heading towards a future in which internet videos are simply treated as untrustworthy across the board.

A great example of this: the Von Restorff effect, which refers to our brainsâ acuity for remembering distinctive pieces of information over more uniform ones, a fact discovered by a German psychiatrist named Hedwig von Restorff. Itâs an interesting fact of biology, but it can also be very useful to know when youâre studying a difficult concept. Hereâs why, and how to put the Von Restorff effect to good use.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-von-restorff-effect\">What is the Von Restorff effect?</h2><p>In previous articles, Iâve discussed various memory effects you can capitalize on when you study, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-primacy-effect-can-help-you-remember-informat-1850432109\" target=\"_blank\">primacy effect</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-proust-effect-can-help-you-study-1850749025\" target=\"_blank\">Proust effect</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-production-effect-to-study-more-effectively-1850915123\" target=\"_blank\">production effect</a>. All of these begin with a nice, a round-looking âP\" and the consonant blend of \"Pr-.\" If I add the Von Restorff effect to that list, it will stand out solely because of the variety in its nameâthe rigid angle of that âV\" and the hard sound of the Restorff. Because of this, youâre more likely to remember the Von Restorff effect when asked to name the four memory phenomena we just went overâand <em>thatâs </em>the Von Restorff effect in action.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the simplest terms, it is an âisolation effectâ that ensures your brain will remember an item in a list if it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other entries on the list. When studying, you can achieve this effect by changing the meaningfulness of an item or a piece of information in some way, whether by color, size, font choice, or another approach.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-von-restorff-effect-to-remember-what-you-study\">How to use the Von Restorff effect to remember what you study</h2><p>The good news is that, unlike when you try to harness the power of other memory-based study techniques, this one is pretty straightforward. It's almost too simple, which is why you might not be familiar with it or ever have considered finding ways to use it. Once you realize the simplicity of this concept, itâs easy to find ways to work it into your study habits. </p><ul><li><p>In your notes, use a highlighter specifically to highlight words or concepts you need to remember for a test. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">Color-coding your notes</a> is a supremely helpful studying technique on its own because even taking the time to choose the colors and their meanings helps you focus. </p></li><li><p>When using flashcards, write concepts and words youâre having a hard time grasping in a different color. If you're using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner method</a> (which you should be), you can rewrite or recreate cards every time you drill them. With that technique, you move your cards into piles every time you get them right or wrong, then study the piles at different frequencies, focusing on ones you know less often than ones that are giving you trouble. Every few times you move a card up or down into a pile, try rewriting or recreating it with a different text color. If a card is red but your color for easy ones is blue, you'll be instantly reminded that this is one you recently struggled with, which can help you lock in and pull the information from your memory using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">active recall</a>. </p></li><li><p>When studying with others and talking through the material (or reading aloud from your notes), try associating a unique motionâlike a specific hand gestureâwith the concepts youâre discussing. </p></li><li><p>Use a shape, like a circle or box, to outline key parts of your notes or textbook materials. Do this when you're mind-mapping, especially, so all your mind maps are uniform. Dates can be in squares, vocab words in circles, and so on. To make quick and efficient mind maps, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">an app like Xmind</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">mind-mapping</a>, move the circle containing the most important concepts (or the one youâre struggling to grasp) to a more removed part of your page, differentiating it from the rest of the clusters visually. I do a version of this with my to-do list, which is written on a whiteboard on the fridge. Unusual things, like a doctor's visit or something I need to buy but don't usually get on my weekly trip to the grocery store, get written off to the side. They're more notable that way, drawing my attention away from the larger block of text and reminding me, over and over, that I have to do them. By the time doctor's appointment day rolls around or I'm in the store trying to remember my list, those are seared into my brain. </p></li><li><p>If you're revising your notes, use different text styles. This is something I did all the time in college, even when taking notes in class. I would bold anything a professor led into by announcing, \"This will be on the test.\" I would turn vocab words purple. Even if you're hand-writing (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">which you should be!</a>), you can draw squiggly underlines under certain ideas, circle others ... you get the point. Get zany with it, but keep it uniform. If you draw a big box around one date, do it to all of them. If you draw arrows pointing to a state law and a circle around a federal one, do it to all of them. </p></li></ul><p>The goal is to differentiate the things you need or struggle to remember using color, motion, shape, or even orientation. Setting certain ideas or words apart will make them stick in your brain better, no matter how you do it. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

The updates immediately reflected on the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton app</a> and the interfaces of the company's existing at-home workout equipment, so even if you don't <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-new-upgraded-cross-training-bike-treadmill-row\" target=\"_blank\">upgrade to a new Bike or Tread</a>, you'll still benefit. One of the biggest updates is the new \"personalized plan,\" which uses information based on your preferred workout types, goals, and available times to create a weekly workout schedule for you. I tested it for a week and found it a lot easier to use than I was expecting. </p><h2 id=\"what-the-peloton-personalized-plan-does\">What the Peloton personalized plan does</h2><p>With the new update, you can log into the Peloton app on your mobile device and you'll see the personalized plan option right at the top. Tapping it brings you to a series of questions about your goals (like gaining strength or supporting weight loss or maintenance), what types of exercises you prefer (like cycling or walking), how experienced you are at working out, and how many days per week you can devote to exercise. There's even a question about what you'd like to do on rest and recovery days, like stretching, meditating, or yoga. You can change your answers at any time. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you fill it all out, the app generates your personal plan, which updates every Monday and includes something to do each day, even if it's a rest day. My original plan included cardio on Monday, upper body and core work on Tuesday, recovery on Wednesday, intervals on Thursday, lower body and core on Friday, a full-body day on Saturday, and a rest day on Sunday. </p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-2.fill.size_2000x1327.v1760040359.png\" alt=\"Peloton personal plan\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-2.fill.size_800x531.v1760040359.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-2.fill.size_1400x929.v1760040359.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-2.fill.size_2000x1327.v1760040359.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Peloton</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>After the plan is generated based on your inputs, you'll always find it at the top of the screen when you open the app. Your suggested classes for the day will appear there, but you can tap <strong>See your weekly plan</strong> to pull up the full schedule. You can tap the classes recommended for the day to start working out or work ahead or backward. It's not super rigid; it's more of a broad overview of all the things your week <em>should</em> include to align with your goals, scheduled in a way that makes the most sense. But you can override whatever you want.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-1.fill.size_2000x1333.v1760040359.png\" alt=\"Peloton Personal Plan\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-1.fill.size_800x533.v1760040359.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-1.fill.size_1400x933.v1760040359.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K75995NGC8JDA896F0YRY4NN/images-1.fill.size_2000x1333.v1760040359.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Peloton</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>For instance, you don't have to take a certain class if you don't want to. It recommends particular cycling classes to me frequently, but I've found that any cycling class I take \"counts\" toward completing a personalized plan class. The other day, I took a yoga class in a studio and used my Peloton app to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/track-all-workouts-with-peloton-app\" target=\"_blank\">track a non-Peloton strength workout</a>. To my surprise, it counted that as one of my \"plan\" classes for the day, since I was supposed to do strength that day. I didn't do the exact class it recommended, but that didn't matter. </p><h2 id=\"why-i-like-this-more-than-i-thought-i-would\">Why I like this more than I thought I would</h2><p>I am a big fan of my app streaks, as gamifying the tasks I need to do every day motivates me a lot. (I have a 206-day streak on Peloton right now, for the record.) I was initially worried the personalized plan would be too structured and throw me off. Would I be penalized for not doing cardio on a day it told me to? Would this somehow affect my streak? The answers are no. There is no penalty for <em>not</em> following the plan. In fact, it's quite flexible. Like I said, any workout you do can count toward the plan, not just the workouts it suggests. Moreover, it doesn't matter if you take a class or track a workout that doesn't count toward it. You're still in charge of what you use the app for and how you work out.

/><p>When youâre assigned a text, youâre supposed to take away the big-picture ideas. The problem is that sometimes, you can miss the forest for the trees, skimming passages just to get it all over with. To get to that broad understanding you need, you should use a method that is all about being detail-oriented. Itâs called âclose reading,â and it will help you grasp whatever you read so you understand not only your assigned passage or chapter, but the concept you're studying overall.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-close-reading\">What is close reading?</h2><p>Close reading is a method that requires you to focus on every detail in a text and operate on the assumption that no detail is in there by accident or for no reason. That's not an assumption so much as it's a fact. Think about the process required for that content to be in front of you. A subject matter expert had to research it all, write it all down, pass it through perhaps an agent and definitely an editor, if not multiple editors. If it's for school, that material had to be reviewed by some kind of board and approved for use. Everything that made it to the final version had multiple sets of eyes on it. All of it is important and deserves to be there; anything irrelevant would likely have been cut. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/oPrXY?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Teaching%20Literature&short_url=oPrXY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fuse-close-reading-to-retain-every-detail-when-you-study&event_label=Teaching%20Literature\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>Teaching Literature</em></a>, literary critic Elaine Showalter says that âclose readingâ is âslow reading, a deliberate attempt to detach ourselves from the magical power of storytelling and pay attention to language, imagery, allusion, intertextuality, syntax, and form.â The idea is to break the habit of reading casually or taking everything in at once and instead form a new habit wherein you examine every tiny element of what youâre reading and question why the author included it.</p><p>The method is even included in the <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED541436.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">United Statesâ Common Core standards for K-12 education</a>. There, itâs defined as âthe methodical investigation of a complex text through answering text dependent questions geared to unpack the textâs meaning.â </p><p>Essentially, youâre not just looking at what the text says, but <em>how </em>it says itâand thatâs beneficial: <a href=\"https://litinfocus.com/4-major-benefits-close-reading/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Per Literacy in Focus</a>, that means youâll eventually be able to truly grasp what the text <em>means</em>. <a href=\"https://fisherpub.sjf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1238&context=education_ETD_masters\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Educators have researched</a> the use of the method and found it increases reading comprehension, for instance. Using close reading helps learners understand what a text says, but also why itâs important. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-close-reading-method\">How to use the close reading method</h2><p>Close reading involves reading everything twice (or more than twice). The first time is to get what it says, but the following times are to understand why it says it and why it says it <em>that way</em>. The goal is to be able to apply that deeper thinking and understanding to what you learned the first time through.</p><h3>Read for understanding</h3><p>On your first pass through the material, just get the gist. Figure out the main argument or story, who is speaking, and to whom. Don't worry about details. Just take it all in and make a mental note of what stands out, confuses or, or seems relevant.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Read for details</h3><p>On your second time through the content, you'll actually do the \"close reading\" part. Highlight key terms, circle new words, and look all of those those up. Pay special attention to formatting, like subtitles, section breaks, and visuals like charts or photos. Remember: None of it is in there by accident. Think, too, about how the information is ordered. Does the author start broad, describing an issue before zeroing in on examples? Or do they start with a specific example and <em>then</em> explain broader context? </p><h3>Ask questions</h3><p>Read it again, but this time, ask questions. Write them down on a separate paper or even in the margins. It's likely you'll be reading something digital, so just open up a blank word processing doc if you have to. Some questions to ask, though these will vary depending on your content, grade level, author, and more:</p><ul><li><p>Why is this section titled the way it is?</p></li><li><p>Why did the author use that [evocative/obscure/flippant/etc.] word?</p></li><li><p>Why introduce this idea before that one?</p></li><li><p>Why did the author start the chapter with a character-driven story before explaining the broader context? </p></li><li><p>Who is the intended audience? Students? Educators? The general public? Plumbers? Politicians? </p></li></ul><p>Crucially, ask questions evenâor especiallyâif you're unsure of the answer. Maybe you <em>don't</em> know why the author used a particular phrase or for whom the content was written. That doesn't matter. By asking, you become more curious and think more deeply. It keeps you engaged. </p><h3>Read for meaning</h3><p>Once you've read it enough times that you've identified the main idea and found some questions to ask, you've made it to your final read-through. Here, zoom out. Stop thinking of individual words, unusual punctuation, or why the author included a particular graph. Think instead of the bigger picture again, like you did on that first read-through. What's the author's purpose? How do the things you noticed the second time through or the questions you asked the third time through contribute to that message? </p><p>Maybe a recurring reference in a short story hints at a theme. Maybe the structure of an essay is meant to mirror the thoughts of its subject. That's what this exercise is about. You're moving beyond <em>what</em> the text says and understanding <em>how</em> it's delivering its message. Obviously, this is a useful practice when studying literature, but it works for a variety of subjects. If you're reading history, you might wonder why an author frames a particular battle or policy in a negative or positive way and wonder, too, how the people on the other side of that battle or policy feltâand why their view isn't represented. Even asking those questions gets you thinking deeper and relating more to the material, which makes it not only easier to understand, but easier to remember. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

I've found a ton of ways to use it to be more efficient in my everyday life, which is (much) more than I can say for other AI-enabled applications I've tried. Instead of (poorly) doing the work for you, NotebookLM acts as a true helper, assisting in organizing information for you without being intrusive. And one of the most useful ways to interact with it is via its familiar chat interface, which has turned the program into my new study buddy, and a resourceful co-worker. \nHow I use NotebookLM's AI chat for studyingI've been studying for a certification exam and have been uploading my materials into NotebookLM whenever I get to a new chapter. From there, I've been able to make flashcards, mind maps, practice quizzes, and study podcasts with a few clicks. The podcasts are especially unique and helpful: Two AI-generated voices discuss the concepts from my notes and materials in an informational, conversational way that sounds just like a podcast—if said podcast were a little too pedantic and on-the-nose. (Sometimes, it even adds in tics like vocal fry to make things sound that much more realistic.)\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nUsually, I listen to a podcast on my chapter while I complete a chore, like packaging up my Poshmark sales. Then, I go back to the notebook and have it generate flashcards or a quiz to see how much information I retained. Each flashcard or quiz question includes a link to the source material, so I can click it and review the full passage in the left-side panel.I find the tool so useful, I've become something of an evangelist for it. A friend of mine recently went back to school, and I taught them how to upload the slide decks, chapter scans, PDFs, and other materials from their online classes into NotebookLM. They now use the chatbot to summarize a given class's content and create outlines for discussion posts. Using the chatbot to create outlines has been helpful for my friend, who struggles with writing but excels in thinking practically. They're able to ask the bot to generate key dates, important facts, and other concrete facts that they should be studying and referencing in their discussion posts, but which they find difficult to pull out of the dense material themselves. The chatbot has also been useful for my own studying, but in a different way. Unlike my back-to-school friend, I have no idea what's going to be on my certification test. I don't get a study guide. I know that out of 23 chapters of material, a random selection of questions will be given to me, which means I have to study everything, hoping I adequately cover what appears on my final exam. So after listening to my podcast and drilling my flashcards, I ask the bot to summarize the main idea of each chapter and suggest five of the most crucial points within it. Even though I know I have to read the whole thing, this gives me a roadmap for where to start and what to look out for. In that way, it's similar to using a traditional study technique like KWL or SQ3R to formulate questions before a critical reading session. I've also like to tell the chatbot to \"have a conversation with me\" about specific topics within the chapters. This is my version of the Feynman technique, in which you interrogate your mastery of a topic by trying to teach someone else about it, although I'm not \"teaching\" the bot so much as talking to it. By going back and forth conversationally, I practice describing the terms and ideas in a casual way, which I can't do if I'm not intimately familiar with them. If I find myself struggling to keep up the conversation, I know I have to study that section more. How I use NotebookLM's AI chat for workBack in May, I published a series here on Lifehacker entitled \"Moving Made Simple.\" In writing and researching nearly a dozen articles for it, I interviewed something like 13 moving pros from around the world. I ended up with a stack of interview transcripts to sort through, and the idea of rereading them all to highlight the most important information, plus cross-reference reoccurring advice shared by multiple sources, was daunting, to say the least. I found myself struggling to remember who recommended what, and in what context, and determining which story each tip was best suited for. But then I turned to NotebookLM. I opened up a new notebook and dropped in copies of all of my transcripts. Because NotebookLM only pulls information from the sources and materials you input, I could then ask its built-in chatbot questions without worrying it would spit out nonsense culled from a dubious, 10-year-old Reddit post. I asked it things like, \"What do the sources recommend for carrying large furniture?\" and \"What order should someone pack their belongings in before a move?\" and NotebookLM made simple lists in response, with each answer including a hyperlink to the exact transcript from which it came. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA number of pros recommended the same things, like packing hanging clothes in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for the hanger hook, and NotebookLM condensed all of those, highlighting that this was a top tip that I should definitely include. On request, it also included each speaker's name next to a given tip so I never had to go searching around for who said what, or risk misattributing something. NotebookLM made summarizing, organizing, and attributing all of this material so much easier than if I had spent hours going through the transcripts and highlighting everything myself.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google/Lindsey Ellefson\n                    \n    \nAnother benefit: Unlike ChatGPT, I didn't feel gross about using this chatbot, as it wasn't exploiting the work of others or risking producing questionable results or full-blown hallucinations—all out its output was based on my own hard-won input. I did the work of formulating questions, finding sources, and conducting interviews. The chat program just helped me organize it all so I could use it to turn the quotes and information into useful, actionable stories. (Note that at no point did I ask AI to help me draft articles—I used it for backend organization only.)In the months since, any time I've had a large volume of materials to work through to complete a given task, NotebookLM has been a useful tool. I sometimes use the chat feature to ask it for summaries, main ideas, or outlines of my notes, but I most often employ it to pull out quotes or standout concepts. It has helped me become a much more organized, efficient writer.How I use NotebookLM in my daily life As long as there are relevant, concrete materials available to upload to the tool, you can NotebookLM for other purposes as well. I think of it like relying on a single source of truth (SSOT), an older productivity hack that involves putting all the materials related to a certain project into one computer folder—but better, because in addition to giving you space to store all your resources, NotebookLM can organize them for you. Personally, I've uploaded copies of my schedule and asked the tool to outline my travel and time commitments for the week. (Not everything you input has to be a file or link. There is a plaintext option where you can just type out whatever you need the bot to know.) But you can get much more creative with it. Say you're looking for a new job. You might upload a job description and ask the NotebookLM chatbot to prepare 20 potential interview questions you might face. Or go farther: Upload relevant news articles about a prospective employer's culture, recent scandals, milestones, or the latest investor report, and use all of that to gain an overview of the company. The more information you provide, the more useful the output will be—and again, it will only pull from those sources, meaning you should be able to trust its summaries. To make sure of this, I periodically test the chatbot (because I'm a suspicious person). I'll ask it about a totally unrelated topic that I know isn't in the materials I uploaded, and so far, it has always told me my question is \"interesting,\" but that there is no reference to it in the provided resources. Other possible use cases could include summarizing meeting transcripts, asking it to suggest meaningful themes in your recent journal entries, or outlining a five-year plan for your career. Your options are almost endless, and bound only by the quality and volume of the source material you upload. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I have recommended it for studying, used it for my own work loads of times, and generally found it to be one of the best bits of software available right now. But recently, I tried using it on my phone, not just on my computer browser—and it fell surprisingly flat. Here's how I've been managing to use it via mobile, anyway, and why you should stick to the computer version for now. What is NotebookLM?NotebookLM is a language model that only uses resources you provide. Like ChatGPT, it can offer summaries, outlines, and studying or organizational help, but unlike ChatGPT, it's not pulling from the World Wide Web to do that. Instead, you upload PDFs, links, plain text, and documents and, when you ask it a question, it relies only on those to give you an answer. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHere's a practical example.: I use it a lot when I'm writing an article that features a load of interviews. I copy and paste my interview transcripts into NotebookLM, then prompt it, to, say, \"Find me three quotes about the value of good sleep.\" If three of my sources mentioned how important it is to get a good night's rest, I'll get three quotes right away, plus a hyperlink to where they each appear in their respective interview, so I can go back and read the context around them. It makes being organized so much easier and I don't waste time searching, word by word, through every transcript for what I need. For studying, it's even better. You can upload all the slide decks, e-texts, and notes you have from a class, then ask it to generate practice quizzes, flashcards, summaries, or essay outlines. One of its coolest features is that it will even create a fake podcast, complete with two hosts who have vocal ticks and even vocal fry. The two AI hosts discuss the material from your sources in an informational, conversational way, like a real podcaster might, and you can listen to it and learn wherever you are. It's been incredibly helpful for me, and it doesn't feel unethical to use, like other AI chatbots, because it's synthesizing information I already found, compiled, and put the work in on. It doesn't feel like I'm cheating when I use it; instead, it feels like I'm getting a little boost in my organization, but still doing most of the work. Plus, there's never a risk that it will make up a fake fact or pull in information that is irrelevant or faulty, like there is with ChatGPT. It relies only on what you give it. The mobile app problemAll of that said, I became and stayed obsessed with this after only using it on my desktop browser for the last six months or so. Last weekend, though, I was studying for an upcoming certification exam and was, as usual, using NotebookLM to generate flashcards, quizzes, and fake podcasts. But I was also cleaning my apartment and doing the laundry, which involved a lot of running to and from the laundromat. I decided to use the NotebookLM iPhone app so I could study on the go; I assumed that since the product is so stellar on the computer, it would be great on the app, too. It was not.On the app, all you can do is review your sources, talk to the chatbot, and listen to your generated podcasts. Here's what you can't do:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGenerate flashcardsReview existing flashcardsGenerate a quizTake existing quizzesSelect the sources from which you make a podcast, quiz, flashcards, or chat topicOne of the best things about the browser version is you can toggle sources on and off. So, if you upload a separate PDF for five different book chapters, you can select only Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 before generating a quiz or flashcards, for instance. If you keep them all selected, your quizzes, flashcards, podcasts, or chats will pull from all of them. By narrowing the scope, you can study more specifically. You can't do that on the app, but it doesn't actually matter because you can't generate (or use) anything on the app, anyway. You can generate a podcast, but only one that pulls from all your sources. The other features—quizzes and flashcards—aren't available at all. Workarounds for NotebookLMThe first workaround I found was a little annoying: I generated a podcast for every chapter using my computer, then listened to them through the mobile app on my phone while I ran my errands. I had to stay on top of my schedule, bouncing from cleaning to laundromat to computer and back again, so I wouldn't find myself without a study podcast to review, but all in all, I got the hang of it. You can't do this for flashcards, quizzes, or mind maps, but if you're after the podcasts, this works with some pre-planning.The second workaround is not to use the app at all. Most websites and companies want to push you toward app use, presumably for data-collection purposes, but never forget there is a browser on your phone, too. I navigated to the NotebookLM website on my mobile browser and, though it's smaller and harder to navigate than the computer, have been able to use it to generate flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and more. You can check and uncheck sources on the mobile browser version, which is ideal. I'm hopeful the app will improve. NotebookLM is such a great resource that has helped me a ton, but it would be much better if it were more usable in its app format. I can't always be attached to my laptop; the real value of studying with flashcards, especially, is that they should be accessible and reviewable anywhere via my phone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That said, while it's a good idea to have a strategy for actually retaining what you’re going over, if your method is too convoluted, you’ll never stick to it—and then it's just as useless as mindlessly rereading the same section five times. The best study methods not only rely on research and established understandings of how memory works, but are easy to incorporate in a practical way. The \"123\" method meets all the criteria of a good study method. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhat is the 123 study method?The 123 study method is a lot like the 2357 method, except it’s much easier to stay on top of and actually execute. With 2357, you review and revise your notes and materials on days two, three, five, and seven after first learning them, which is a tricky schedule to remember and maintain. You can and should, however, call on a study-scheduling app, like My Study Life, to help you with this and other time-based academic tasks.The 123 method is simpler: On day one, you learn your material. On day two, you review it. Review it again on day three, then don’t think about it for a week, at which point you'll review it again. Again, use of a planner, calendar, or scheduler is encouraged here. These techniques are useful, but only if you actually execute and stick to them, so don't be afraid to get a little boost from an app or even your phone's built-in \"reminders\" function.Why the 123 study method worksThe 123 method relies on distributed practice, which calls for you to review your materials at spaced intervals to better retain them in your long-term memory. That's a technique that works fabulously, but often, adherents expect you to distribute the practice in ways that are difficult to manage. By going over it for three days, then giving your brain a week and seeing how much you retained, you can fit distributed practice into your life a lot more easily than if you follow some elaborate, torturous schedule of off days and on days.This method is best done about 10 days out from a big test, so you can study and review on those first three days, then once more the day before the test. How you review is up to you, but you can try flashcards, which help you with memory retrieval, or blurting, which helps you identify your problem areas by forcing you to recall as much information as you can without looking at your notes. Whatever method you choose for the actual review, try to make sure it incorporates some element of active recall, or the act of forcing yourself to pull key information from your memory.Just know that the one-week interval between reviews is key. When your brain has almost forgotten something, it works a little harder to pull the information out of your memory, which is what will truly help get the facts to stick before your big test. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Drugs, death, and depravity are probably what come to mind whenever you hear about the dark web. Or, is it the deep web? Is it both? You might find yourself conflating the two terms, with the assumption that both the dark web and the deep web are the same place—a spot people flock to for reasons that include illegal and/or generally shady activities. But while the dark web is a part of the deep web, the deep web isn’t really the dark web. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe \"regular internet\" is the surface webI need to start this explanation with a different term altogether: The internet as most of us know it is called the “surface web.” (Perhaps you've also heard it called the open web or visible web.) Essentially, it’s a collection of sites that are indexed by search engines. If it pops up in a Google search, it’s a part of the surface web. This article, for example, is a part of the surface web; CNET's homepage is a part of the surface web; the Facebook login screen is a part of the surface web. Most of the internet you're familiar with is likely covered under this definition. That’s not the case with the deep web or the dark web. You can’t open Chrome and expect to find any dark web pages via a Google search. For the deep web, you'll need to visit each website individually, and, in the case of the dark web, while using a special browser altogether. What exactly is the deep web?Also known as the “hidden” web, the deep web is the collection of sites that aren’t indexed by search engines. Most of these sites are obscured behind login pages, and can range from banking and email pages, to paywalled content like streaming sites. Sure, you’ll find Netflix via a Google search, but you won’t find the player for Love Is Blind, Season 9, Episode 1 unless you log into the site first. The deep web also consists of protocol pages, responsible for identifying user accounts when you log in to a site, running payments when you make a purchase, and other processes you never need to see. In short, it’s both the backbone of the internet, as well as a part of the internet you regularly interact with yourself. And it's actually what makes up most of the internet: According to CrowdStrike, the deep web accounts for over 90% of all content online. Deep web pages aren’t indexed, but they often have URLs that can be linked to directly, and are accessible from traditional web browsers like Chrome or Firefox. In your daily life online, you frequently jump between the surface web and the deep web, likely without realizing it. When you open your bank's website, that's the surface web. When you log into your account, your balance and investments are hosted on the deep web. When you open a YouTube video, that's the surface web. If you access your YouTube account's settings page, that's the deep web. You jump through these hoops all the time, but fear not: Your frequent deep web activity never puts you in danger of accessing the dark web. What exactly is the dark web?The dark web is a subsection (a small one, at that) of the deep web. But unlike the latter, the dark web is not accessible via a typical web browser like Chrome or Firefox. That's because it's not just hidden by login pages or hidden URLs; the dark web uses both encryption and routing to mask its websites, as well as proxy servers to host requests and traffic without any centralized regulation. This is still the deep web, it's just not a part of it you'd ever stumble upon by accident.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to access the dark webIf you want to access the dark web, you need special tools to do so. A specific browser, such as Tor, for example, is required to get started. Just as you use Chrome to access public internet sites like Facebook or Lifehacker, you use a dark web browser to access dark web pages. It's also common to know the specific dark web site you want to visit ahead of time; these often end in .onion instead of .com. While the dark web does have its own search engines, like Ahmia, Torch, and even a special version of DuckDuckGo, they are not as robust as the search engines you're used to.   Since you need special protocols to access these sites, that traffic is often private and anonymous. That’s what makes the dark web an attractive option for illegal activities—the site activity isn’t as easily traced back to individual user accounts. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the common tender on the dark web, since it also protects your privacy during transactions. The dark web isn't just illegal stuffWhen you think of the “dark web,” you probably imagine an underground, secretive network of sites, where illegal activities are aplenty, passing drugs, contraband, and illicit media with reckless abandon. You might also hear about data leaks ending up on the dark web, with bad actors paying for your passwords, hacked accounts, and credit card info. Those sites surely exist, but they’re only one part of what’s known as the dark web, which isn't only a playground for the perverse and malicious. While many common use-cases for the dark web might be against the law, anyone with a reason to be anonymous online can utilize the networks. Common examples of “good” on the dark web are whistleblowers who need a place to leak their information without having the governments and organizations responsible for that data knowing who they are, as well as legitimate news and information sites for citizens of countries with strict censorship laws. One study from 2020 estimates that 57% of the dark web contains illegal content. If true, that's a lot, but it also means the other 43% isn't breaking the law.  In short, the deep web is not a scary place. The dark web can be, but not always.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.Researchers have demonstrated a new type of malware attack that can steal sensitive information from Android devices—including Google and Samsung phones—without the knowledge or action of the target user. The attack is called \"Pixnapping,\" an apparent portmanteau of \"pixel\" and \"snapping.\" When you download and open a piece of software containing the malware, the app scans your phone for specific apps it might want to spy on. It then accesses another app on your phone—say, Google Authenticator—but rather than open it, it pulls the information that would be displayed into the Android rendering pipeline. From there, the app scans the display information for individual pixels, targeting areas known to contain sensitive information. In the case of Google Authenticator, the focus is on the pixels known to contain the 2FA codes within the app. The malware then checks to see whether a pixel is blank, or contains some type of rendered content. It uses these findings to recover the original images, like a complete 2FA code, without ever actually having seen the original images in the first place. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis process can repeat for as long as it takes to scan the stolen pixels and pull the original information from them, all without you knowing it's happening. Researchers compare the process to taking screenshots of screen contents the malware should not have access to.How the malware worksThere are three reasons Pixnapping attacks are possible on Android, according to researchers. First, the OS allows apps to send another app's activity to the Android rendering pipeline, which allows the malicious app to invoke sensitive activities, like refreshing 2FA codes. Second, apps can run graphical operations on pixels displayed through another app's activity, which is how the malicious app can pull pixels from something like Google Authenticator. Third, apps can measure the pixel color-dependent side effects of those operations, which allows the malicious app to leak the pixel values.Researchers demonstrated these Pixnapping attacks on Google and Samsung phones, including the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Galaxy S25. These phones were running Android 13, 14, 15, and 16. Researchers say they aren't sure if other types of Android devices are affected by this attack, though the \"core mechanisms\" involved are usually present in all Android devices. Different Pixel devices had different rates of success in the 2FA hack (73%, 53%, 29%, and 53% for the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively), though researchers could not obtain 2FA codes on the Galaxy S25 within the 30 second timeline before the codes refreshed.  In addition to devices, researchers demonstrated Pixnapping attacks on sites and services like Gmail, Google Accounts, Signal, Google Authenticator, Venmo, and Google Maps. The implication is that this type of attack could steal many different types of information from your phone, including emails, encrypted messages, payment records, and location histories.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAccording to the findings, Google has tried to patch Pixnapping, but researchers were able to workaround this patch in demonstrated attacks. The vulnerability is currently tracked as CVE-2025-48561. Google is working on a new patch for the December Android security builtin. How to protect yourself from PixnappingThe good news, at this time anyway, is that researchers are not aware of Pixnapping attacks happening in the wild. However, that doesn't mean they won't happen, especially now that the attack has been disclosed. The first thing to do to protect yourself is to make sure you're running the latest security patches on your Android device. While Google is still working on a subsequent Pixnapping patch, there is a patch in existence. Make sure you install it on your phone by heading to System > Software updates.Next, be cautious with the apps you download on your device. Always try to download apps from trusted and verified marketplaces, as it's much more difficult for bad actors to hide malware on apps distributed through these stores. Even when you download apps on something like the Google Play Store, investigate the app thoroughly: Ensure it's really the app you think it is, and it's coming from the developer that makes it. If you sideload apps, be careful with what you download, and only install apps from developers you trust.   \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Take these steps for better search results, including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source.There's much to say about Sora, which is essentially OpenAI's TikTok for AI slop. But putting my concerns aside for what appears to be a glorified deepfake machine, it's evident the app is popular. OpenAI says Sora hit one million downloads in under five days, likely fueled by interest from users seeing hyper-realistic videos going viral on social media. But with big hype, comes big risk for fraud. While OpenAI made Sora free to download, the app started out invite-only, which only built anticipation for users who wanted in. As such, those users might open the App Store, search for Sora, and download the first app that makes itself available—especially if they can start using it right away. That's exactly what happened in this case. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAs reported by TechCrunch, over a dozen fake Sora apps were made available on the iOS App Store following the launch of OpenAI's real app. These apps were either called \"Sora\" or \"Sora 2,\" the latter in reference to the specific video model powering these hyper-realistic AI generations.You might assume developers hastily uploaded these apps to the App Store in an attempt to pull traffic from users curious about Sora. And while that is true, a number of these apps were already live on the App Store long before OpenAI ever announced the Sora app—some of which were operating under different names. It's not clear how many changed their names in this situation, but it's apparent that many did adjust their names shortly after Sora launched. TechCrunch says some apps had been available on the App Store since earlier this year, while others were available since last year.  Apple's App Store isn't the only affected app market here. Google's Play Store played host to fraudulent Sora apps, as well. Taken together, these apps were downloaded more than 300,000 times, with more than 80,000 of those occurring after Sora's official launch. Perhaps the most successful fake Sora app, \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator,\" pulled in over 50,000 downloads alone once OpenAI released Sora. TechCrunch reports that these apps collectively earned over $160,000, all from apps claiming to be something else entirely. At this time, most, but not all, of these apps have been pulled from app stores.How to spot fake apps on your app storeFirst of all, if the app you're trying to download is trendy and popular, like Sora, assume there will be developers trying to spoof it. Malicious developers want to trick users looking for one app into downloading theirs, whether it's to install malware on your device, steal your information, or make money off you by running ads. If they know a million people are going to be downloading an app, hosting a fraudulent one makes for good business.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen looking through the app store's results page, pay close attention to the name of the app. Sure, it might have \"Sora\" in the title, but does it have any odd, extraneous words added in? \"Sora 2 – AI Video Generator\" isn't the worst fake name I've ever seen, but the app's name is Sora, not Sora 2. OpenAI also likely wouldn't add AI Video Generator to its own product's name: They probably know the product speaks for itself, and wouldn't feel the need to clutter up the name with extra details. Instead, the real title is \"Sora by OpenAI,\" likely done to both distinguish itself from legitimate apps named Sora, as well as indicate that it is indeed made by OpenAI.Speaking of which, you should always make sure the app in question is distributed by the company that made it. If you're trying to figure out which of the Sora apps on your app store is the real one, it's going to be the one that says it's made by OpenAI. I'm not talking about the title alone, either. Tap on the app, and look at the developer name underneath the title. If it doesn't match the exact company you know develops the app, don't download it.You'll also want to investigate the copy and images advertising the app here. Is everything written well, and free of spelling and grammar mistakes? Are the images high quality, and reflect the experience the app it advertising? Don't download something that feels slapped together: Some fraudsters don't bother with the finer details.  Finally, make sure the app in question is actually available on the platform you're using. Sora is currently iOS-only, which means any app claiming to be Sora by OpenAI on the Play Store is a fraud. If you're on Android, you'll simply need to wait for OpenAI to make the app for your platform. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

In the end, it just depends on my mood. Good news for people like me: Tonal is rolling out reformer-style Pilates with its new update. If you have the at-home weight training device or are considering getting one, this could be major for you. Even if you're not someone who wakes up on a Saturday morning excited to go trade $65 for 45 minutes on the reformer—or you've never even tried Pilates at all—this is nice because it can allow you to give it a whirl from the comfort of your home, using the same device you use for more traditional strength training. Led by yoga and Pilates instructor Kristin McGee, the classes are broken down by experience level and, like all Tonal workouts, customized to your strength. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow Tonal's Pilates classes feelI got to test out the new Pilates offering last week, which was exciting because I don't have a Tonal machine (yet, since I'm planning to get one) but also daunting because, well, I don't have a Tonal machine. I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew, broadly, that these are digital devices you stick to your wall, calibrate, and work out with basically like you would with your gym's cable machine. They use magnetic resistance to increase and decrease the weight that you're pulling on. \nFirst, I did a few regular lifting exercises so the machine could determine how strong I am. Any user will do these same four exercises to get a baseline. From then on, the machine will set up all weights for all exercises to align with what that person can do, progressively increasing the weight over time as the user gets stronger. Then it was Pilates time. The big difference between the new Pilates offerings and the traditional strength training on Tonal is the same difference you find when you compare using a cable machine to using a reformer: With the Pilates moves, the resistance gets harder as you push or pull, whether because of the springs on the reformer or the settings on the Tonal. I did some leg circles, some hundreds, and a handful of other standard Pilates moves—and besides the fact I was laying flat on the floor and interacting with a big digital machine, it did feel pretty similar to using a reformer. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Tonal Pilates specsThis program won't be out officially for Tonal users until Nov. 17, but you can order your loop attachments now. Made in partnership with Pilates Loops, they cost $100 and are similar to the straps you get on a standard reformer. There's a long loop, a short loop, and a knot you can grab farther down, depending on the exercise you're doing and how intense you want it to be. Beyond the loops, no further equipment upgrade is necessary—software updates will hit Tonal 1 and Tonal 2 machines in November. The Pilates upgrade will work with the digital weight technology that comes along in all the equipment and will go up to 10 resistance levels. The machine makes small adjustments as you work through the moves, which are presented and demonstrated by McGee, so if you're having a hard time or something is too easy, the adjustments are automatic. Tonal did already offer mat Pilates classes and while I love those, they're not quite the same as fighting against a machine custom-built for the struggle, which is why I still find myself trekking to a studio a few times a week even though I have access to mat Pilates classes through YouTube, Peloton, and my gym. The addition of this programming adds a more in-depth option for anyone looking for a workout that's easy on the joints, engages the core, and boosts mobility and balance. A Tonal 2 costs $4,295 and a monthly membership runs you $60. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

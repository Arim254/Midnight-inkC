And I'm exactly the type to buy into the under-desk treadmill appeal. Why shouldn't I want to walk while I work, burn calories during calls, and transform my sedentary office prisons into a wellness wonderland—all without sacrificing a single billable hour? (Never mind that I don't work in an office or bill my hours.) Office fitness is the perfect hack for our optimization-obsessed culture, promising that we can have it all: career success and physical health, no trade-offs required. But when I see an under-desk treadmill, I also remember when we all swore that replacing our desk chairs with yoga balls would change our lives. Or that a standing desk, or a balance board, or some kind of pedaling contraption would do the same. In other words, nothing ever changes. I'm not denying that there's a problem with fully sedentary work days; it's just that no one gadget ever seems to be the solution. And the problem isn't that we lack willpower or that the products are inherently flawed. The problem is that we're buying solutions to the wrong problem.The allure of multitasking your way to healthI'm not immune to the fantasy either. When you're drowning in deadlines and meetings bleed into evenings, the idea that you could somehow merge your workout with your workday feels like a lifeline. Why carve out an hour for the gym when you could just walk while answering emails? It's efficient! It's smart! It's...probably not going to work the way you hope.\n\"I think these products can and do work for some people, but there's an important caveat: there's no replacement for actually getting away from your desk for a mental and physical break,\" says Jen Fisher, formerly the chief wellbeing officer at Deloitte. \"There's a real irony here—these products aim to solve one problem (sedentary behavior) but reinforce another (never truly disconnecting from work).\"Therein lies the paradox: We're trying to optimize ourselves into working more, not better. An under-desk treadmill might give you movement, sure, but it keeps you tethered to your screen, always available, always productive. You might think that if anyone could make office fitness gadgets work, it would be Google—a company famous for its wellness perks and campus amenities. But even there, this pattern persists. \"I love the treadmill desks that we have available whenever I've used them,\" says Shosh Brodman, a senior Google Workspace program manager with over 13 years at the company. \"But I think I've used it maybe less than five times.\" Brodman's experience with an under-desk pedaling device was similar: initial excitement followed by abandonment.She says that despite access to gyms, treadmill desks, and a culture that supports movement, the fundamental problem remains: the structure of modern work doesn't actually allow for these interventions. The one thing that did work for her? Step-tracking contests that encouraged actual breaks and movement, creating social motivation to escape the desk entirely. Compared to an under-desk treadmill, a real lunch walk gives you something far more valuable: a little mental space, entirely separate from work.Fitness gadgets become another source of anxietyThe fitness gadget industrial complex has convinced us that the path to wellness is paved with data, tracking, and technology. But for many people, these tools become yet another thing to feel bad about.\"When it specifically comes to products that people use to mitigate their sedentary lifestyle, gadgets are never the answer,\" says Melissa Painter, founder of Breakthru, an app that guides users through two-minute movement breaks. \"Especially not gadgets that cause us inadvertently to outsource our body's intelligence to a piece of tech. The minute we're staring at data in the face of what we've 'done wrong,' the more likely we're going to put it in a drawer and step away.\"This points to a pattern many of us recognize: the sleep tracker that made us more anxious about sleep, the step counter that turned movement into a guilt-inducing scorecard. Tools are only useful if they nudge us toward feeling better, rather than becoming another metric of inadequacy.The absurdity becomes clear when we consider what actually helps us think and solve problems. \"The reason going for a walk helps you solve a problem is because you're moving and untethered,\" Painter says. \"The space and time away from your screen is an invitation for your mind to wander just enough so that instinctual solutions can emerge. Walking on a treadmill is not going to have the same impact. It's like trying to do the wrong kinds of thinking at once.\"Breaking free from productivity cultureHere's what makes our gadget obsession even more frustrating: We already know what works, but we just don't want to hear it, because it requires actually stepping away from work. \"It's very American to think we don't need breaks,\" Painter says. Trapped in non-stop productivity culture, we fall prey to this idea that \"wellness\" requires an enormous amount of time and money. We live in a culture that treats rest as laziness and breaks as luxuries. Fisher says that the type of work matters: \"For passive tasks—listening to a meeting, reading documents—these tools might genuinely help. But I worry about the cultural message when we're optimizing to work more rather than building in real breaks that actually support our wellbeing.\" If these gadgets work in addition to actual breaks, great. But if you're thinking \"now I can skip my lunch walk because I have a treadmill desk,\" that's where we've gone wrong.Fitness gadgets around the office allow us to maintain this idea that we can always be productive without any downtime. As if our bodies are just machines that need the right accessories to run indefinitely. We'd rather invest in expensive gadgets that let us keep working than accept that you might need to actually stop and rest. As a result, most of us end the workday feeling overwhelmed, fatigued, nowhere near the end of our to-do lists, and nowhere close to wanting to go to the gym. The problem isn't the under-desk treadmill itself, but the slippery slope of non-stop-optimization it represents. So, what's the solution?  How to actually prioritize your wellness at workThe irony is that the effective solutions are free and simple—they just require us to challenge the \"always on\" culture we've normalized.What people need instead are genuinely brief interventions that help them feel better and reconnect with their bodies. Getting up to see the sun. Watering a plant. Taking a walking meeting. These aren't fancy, and they don't require a $1,200 piece of equipment, but they do require something that feels even more expensive in our work culture: permission to stop working, even briefly.There's no need to swear off all office fitness products. Standing desks with decent ergonomics have real value for shifting body position throughout the day. If you genuinely use that balance board or under-desk elliptical regularly for passive tasks, and it's in addition to real breaks, keep at it.But for most of us, the better investment isn't another gadget—it's the harder work of time management and cultural change:Set actual boundaries around breaks. Block time for a real lunch away from your desk. Schedule walking meetings. Stand up and stretch between Zoom calls. These sound obvious because they are, but we skip them because we've internalized the message that real breaks are indulgent.Question the productivity narrative. Just like your doctor has been telling you for years: more movement throughout your day, across your lifetime, improves thinking, mood, focus, and attention span. If you still want to think in terms of productivity, consider that taking breaks isn't sacrificing productivity, but actually promoting it. Start absurdly small. You don't need a $1,500 treadmill desk. You need to get up once an hour and walk to the window. Water a plant, step outside for a coffee, or try to touch your toes. The bottom lineThe fitness gadget industry thrives on our desire to optimize, to find the one weird trick that lets us have it all. But the actual hack is much less sexy: we need to accept that human bodies require breaks, that our brains need space to wander, and that no piece of equipment will let us cheat these fundamental needs.The treadmill desk isn't evil. It's just a symptom of our broader refusal to accept that rest is productive, and that being fully present for our work sometimes means being fully absent from our screens.So before you click \"buy\" on that under-desk elliptical, ask yourself: Am I solving my sedentariness problem, or am I buying permission to never truly step away from work? Because if it's the latter, you already know where it's going to end up—right next to that dusty yoga ball in the corner.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        If you've booked a hotel through a platform like Booking.com or Expedia, beware any communication that directs you to confirm your payment details to hold your reservation. Threat actors are targeting the hospitality industry with a phishing campaign designed to steal from travelers. As outlined by security firm Sekoia.io and reported by The Hacker News, the scheme is referred to as \"I Paid Twice\" because hotel customers are eventually conned into handing over their banking information. Scammers contact guests via WhatsApp or email about their booking, saying that they need to verify their payment or risk cancellation. The link goes to a fake landing page that looks like Booking.com or Expedia, where victims are prompted to provide card information. This isn't the first scam to target Booking.com: Scammers have previously spoofed the site to spread malware directly to users via both fake CAPTCHAs and homograph attacks, which exploit similar characters in the URL to redirect to a malicious website. \nThis multi-step campaign actually begins when hackers target hotels themselves with ClickFix attacks, a type of social engineering attack designed to trick users into downloading malware via fake error messages or CAPTCHA forms. (I've covered a handful of ClickFix schemes, such as those spread via AI-generated instructional videos on TikTok and expired invite links on Discord.) The scam runs as follows: Hotel managers receive emails from compromised accounts with phishing links that redirect to a supposed reCAPTCHA page. This is the ClickFix component, as targets are instructed to complete the challenge to \"ensure the security of your connection.\" A couple of redirects lead to the user copy and execute a PowerShell command that downloads a Remote Access Trojan (like PureRAT) to their device. Once the malware has been delivered, it allows threat actors remote access, including control of the mouse and keyboard, data exfiltration, command execution, file uploads and downloads, keylogging, and webcam and microphone capture. Hackers are then able to steal admin credentials to gain access to booking platforms and send the aforementioned phishing emails to hotel guests—or they can sell the information to other cybercriminals. Don't fall for the hotel booking scamYou can't control whether a hotel manager unwittingly hands over access to your booking information. But you can avoid further compromising your personal and financial data by staying vigilant to any unexpected communication about your reservation. A reputable hotel probably won't contact you via a booking platform (nor will the platform itself) to demand payment for holding a reservation you've already confirmed. This sense of urgency is meant to trick you into acting quickly, so if you're not sure what's going on, call the hotel directly using the number on their official website (not from the email or WhatsApp message). Don't click any links, and don't enter any information unless you have confirmed that you are on a legitimate booking platform or hotel website. \n            ",

Sure, third-party apps have filled this gap for many years now, but macOS itself didn't allow you to easily view multiple items stored in the clipboard, until now. With macOS 26 Tahoe, your Mac's Spotlight search has added support for clipboard history, which means that you can view pretty much everything you've copied in the past 30 days. Here's how to set up and use clipboard history on your Mac.How to enable clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nClipboard history is disabled by default on macOS Tahoe, so you'll have to activate it first. To do this, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's display and select System Settings. Now, go to Spotlight and scroll to the bottom in the right pane. Enable Results from Clipboard, and then click the drop-down menu below it. This lets you choose how long you want to store your clipboard history for. Apple gives you three choices: 8 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. Once you've made your choice, you'll be ready to use clipboard history on your Mac.If you copy sensitive items to the clipboard very often, you should probably avoid enabling this feature. I know many people who somehow still store passwords, credit card information, and other banking details in WhatsApp chats or plain text files. The moment you copy sensitive data from unsecured locations, it gets added to your clipboard history, which is not ideal. The good news is that if you copy passwords from Apple Passwords or other password management apps, they don't appear in your Mac's clipboard history.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccessing and using clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can access your Mac's clipboard history by using macOS Tahoe's Spotlight Search. First, copy a few items to your clipboard. These can be text, photos, or other files. Use the Command-Space keyboard shortcut (or click the magnifying glass in your Mac's top-right corner) to open Spotlight, and press Command-4. This will open your Mac's clipboard history, where you'll be able to see all the files you've copied recently.To see older items, scroll down. Next to each item, you'll see a small copy button, which you can use to copy that item to your clipboard once again. This is useful if you've copied multiple items in a row, but forgot to paste the first few. You can also select any item in your clipboard history list and press the return key on your keyboard to paste that item in the app that's in the foreground. If you want to quickly clear your clipboard history, fire up Spotlight (Command-Space), followed by the clipboard history page (Command-4), and select the three-dots button on the right. Select Clear History here to erase your entire clipboard. Or you can simply wait—Apple will automatically erase everything in your clipboard after your preset time limit (between 8 hours and 30 days, depending on what you chose in System Settings).Third-party clipboard management apps are better\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm aware that some people don't use Spotlight at all, in favor of better alternatives like Raycast or Alfred. Luckily, those apps come with built-in clipboard managers, too. Spotlight's implementation is good enough for basic use cases, but it needs a quicker way to access and paste from your clipboard history. While clipboard history in Spotlight is a nice upgrade, I still feel that if you're serious about clipboard management, third-party alternatives are the way to go. The best clipboard managers for Mac will allow you to sync your clipboard history across multiple devices, let you exclude certain apps from your clipboard history, filter clipboard items by type (links, text, images, etc.), copy multiple items and paste them sequentially (useful for filling repetitive forms), extract and copy text from images, and so much more. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        MacOS is great in all kinds of ways, but it's far from the most customizable operating system out there. Sure, it's not locked down to the extent iOS and iPadOS are, but compared to Linux and even Windows, macOS really doesn't let you change the look and feel very much.But that isn't to say there's no room to tweak the operating system to make it the way you like—if you know where to look. Here are a few third-party tools that let you make macOS your own.Use a custom cursorIt's pretty easy to change how the mouse pointer looks on Windows and Linux—you just need to dig around in the settings. On macOS, you can only change the size of the pointer.\nUnless, that is, you install the free and open source Mousecape. This application lets you create a cursor, then use it in place of the default system ones. You can also install cursors made by others. There's no centralized collection of cursors for this, unfortunately, but I found a fun hand on Github, some Wii cursors, and a decent collection on DeviantArt. You could also try your hand at creating your own set.Note that Tahoe users will have to download an updated fork in order to use Mousecape—the main build doesn't work at the moment. You'll need to install a pre-release download as of this writing.Use any website as your wallpaper\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nSome great wallpapers, including dynamic ones, are included with macOS. There's also the option to use your own photos. But what macOS doesn't offer are custom, animated wallpapers.Enter Plash. This free application lets you turn any website into a macOS wallpaper, which opens up all kinds of interactive possibilities. A few sites included let you look out a random stranger's window, see real-time weather data, or take in some animated pixel art, but you can use any website you can think of. It's a lot of fun to play around with.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe macOS menu bar is a bit of a mess. Windows makes it relatively easy to hide icons by dragging them to a secondary area. Apple hasn't offered anything like this until Tahoe, which added a way to disable any icon in the settings. The problem: it's all or nothing. Hide an icon in the settings and there's no quick way to access it other than going back into the settings and turning it back on.For that, you'll need a third party app. I personally recommend Ice, which is the best free app for cleaning up your menu bar. My coworker Pranay recommends Barbee, another great option. Both make it easy to hide menu bar icons in a secondary bar accessible by hitting an icon, similar to how it works on Windows. Every Mac user should install some sort of tool like this.Change your folder icons\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThis one isn't unofficial, exactly, but it's so buried it might as well be. You can change the icon for any folder, document, or even application by right-clicking it, clicking \"Get Info\", then dragging an image to the icon in the window that opens. Weird, right? But it works, meaning you can customize folders to look however you want. I talked about this in an article with more details.This gets really fun if you install Fancy Folders, a free application seen in the image above which allows you to create folder icons in the color of your choice, complete with either the text or icon of your choice. It's a lot of fun to play with, and can be very useful for visually keeping things organized.\n            ",

Popular sites like X and ChatGPT were unresponsive, returning error messages rather than their usual homepages. The culprit? A massive Cloudflare outage.The upside is that the outage appears to be ending. Cloudflare says it has identified the problem and issued a fix, so affected websites should be coming back online this morning. But that doesn't change the fact that so many websites went dark today, all because one company experienced unexplained downtime. How is it that a Cloudflare outage can seemingly break the internet? What is Cloudflare?Cloudflare offers a number of products for sites and services with the goals of improving traffic performance and reliability, as well as cybersecurity. A company like Cloudflare spreads its network out throughout the globe, so that when users try to visit a website, the server they ping is the one closest to them. Rather than all users attempting to visit your server at once, they go through their Cloudflare server local. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis serves two main purposes: First, it limits the demand on your site. If all users were trying to ping your server at once, it puts a strain on your network, and could either slow things down or shut them down completely. Routing users to the Cloudflare server closest to them spreads out the demand, and reduces the risk of interruption. In addition, users are less likely to experience delays in physical distance to your network: If you're based in Japan, and your user is based in New York, it's going to take them longer to reach your server than it would a user from South Korea. However, if that New York user instead connects to a Cloudflare server closest to them, they can access your data much more quickly. Why does Cloudflare affect so many websites?Cloudflare's goal is to improve the experience for users around the world to visit international websites—so why does it seem like half the internet went dark when Cloudflare experienced an outage?The reason is because so many websites use Cloudflares services. According to Backlinko, over 24 million websites actively rely on Cloudflare in some capacity. That includes over 4,300 of the 10,000 \"most popular\" websites around the world. The U.S. alone has nearly 2,470,000 million websites relying on Cloudflare, while the UK has almost 780,000. Many other countries, like Brazil, Germany, Russia, Australia, Canada, China, India, and France, each have hundreds of thousands of websites running on Cloudflare.There are over one billion websites out there in the world, which means a total Cloudflare outage would account for roughly 2% of global websites' connectivity issues. However, if Backlinko's stats are correct, a huge percentage of popular websites rely on Cloudflare. Sure, the vast majority of websites may remain unaffected by this outage, but nearly half of the sites people most often visit have problems here. If you primarily visit U.S. websites, that number may be even higher. It's a similar reason why an AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage takes down so many websites. AWS provides cloud computing services for so many companies and websites, that when issues pop-up, you experience problems with your favorite websites. It poses a logistical question for how the global internet currently works: Yes, it's great that services like Cloudflare make it possible to reliably access international websites as if they were within your region—but if too much of the internet leans on it, is it really all that reliable?\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I'm asking the tough questions about whether wearables can really improve your health, how to find the right one for you, and how to make the most of the data wearables can offer.When I test smartwatches and fitness trackers, I always pay attention to accuracy. Is my running pace correct? Does the device capture the ups and downs of my heart rate? I even got a VO2max lab test to check a bunch of watches' fitness scores. But you'll notice that one thing I don't test for accuracy is calorie burn. None of my devices come close to agreeing on the number of calories they think I'm burning, and I don't expect them to. Even scientists who study the accuracy of wearables can't answer the question in a way that's useful when you're shopping for this year's devices—but we'll get into why that is below. There was a time, before Fitbits, when nobody knew quite how many calories they were burning on a daily basis. Sure, you could calculate a rough estimate based on your body size, sex, and age. You could choose whether or not to believe the calorie readout on the cardio machines at the gym. (Spoiler: don't.) But the idea that a gadget on your wrist could tell you how many calories you personally burned during one particular day was revolutionary. It was also wrong.   \nHow fitness trackers calculate calorie burnBefore I discuss how accurate fitness trackers are, let’s look at where they get their numbers. For calorie calculations, the main sources are motion and heart rate data. For motion, trackers use accelerometers to figure out when your body is moving, and by how much. If you have a watch on your wrist, and the watch swings back and forth rhythmically while sort of bouncing up and down, your gadget guesses that you must be walking. If there is quicker bouncing and your wrist makes a smaller movement, you’re probably running. This is the basic idea behind how trackers detect how many steps you’re taking. If you’ve paid attention to your step count, you already know some of the ways this can be inaccurate. If you’re shopping, for example, keeping your hand on the shopping cart handle may result in you not getting credit for the steps you’re taking. That depends on the device, though. (For a perfect illustration of this issue, see these tests I did comparing a Garmin to an Apple Watch on a treadmill. When I rested my hands on the treadmill handle, the Apple Watch recorded 318 steps while the Garmin recorded none.)Then there’s the heart rate sensor: Since your hands don’t always move predictably during exercise, it can be easier to just tell your watch that you’ll be cycling or doing yoga or whatever. The gadget then uses your heart rate to make an educated guess about how much work your body is doing. Whatever the source of the data—heart rate, movements, or a combination—the gadget processes it through a formula to calculate how many calories it thinks you’re burning. Your age, weight, and sex may figure into this equation. Generally, though, the fitness tracker doesn’t actually know how many calories you’re burning; instead, it’s calculating a probable number based on incomplete information. Why there's no simple test for accuracyIf humans were robots, all built the same, all moving in predictable patterns, this formulaic approach might work. But humans are complicated, and technology often gets confused. For example, you may get different step counts if you put a device on your right versus left wrist. And the optical heart rate sensors that a lot of trackers use may be less accurate on dark skin compared to lighter skin. These problems relate to the data that the trackers gather, but calorie burn isn't a direct measurement. It's a calculation, and different algorithms can come up with different calorie burn numbers depending on how the algorithm is designed. The companies that make fitness trackers aren’t required to publish their algorithms or verify that their calorie counts are accurate. They can just put a device on the market, and there you are, comparing wearables on shopping sites without any information about how accurate they are, outside of the companies’ claims.Researchers are interested in fitness trackers’ accuracy, which would seem like a good thing. They want to be able to use wearables in research or recommend them for individuals and healthcare providers, and so they'll run studies comparing consumer devices to lab equipment. This sounds like a great way to answer our questions! But there’s a huge delay in actually getting that information, and it’s often published too late to be useful. By the time a researcher buys a batch of the latest model, runs a study, writes it up, submits it to a journal, and finally gets it published, several years may have gone by, and the company has moved on to the next model. That delay is why I (usually) can't use scientific studies to weigh in on the devices I write about. Here's a great example of how frustrating it can be: this review was published in 2025, and found the Series 1 was the Apple Watch that turned up the most often in the studies the authors were able to gather. The Series 9 and 10 watches were completely missing from the available data, and as a reminder, we're now up to a Series 11. With that caveat about delays, I still think it’s useful to look at the research on fitness trackers to see what themes emerge. Are any of them good at estimating your calorie burn? What studies say about fitness trackers’ accuracyTime for the bad news. A study from 2020 that looked at a variety of gadgets from Apple, Garmin, Polar, and Fitbit found that all the devices are inaccurate more often than they are accurate. The authors considered a device to be accurate if its reading was plus or minus 3% when compared to a more reliable measure of energy expenditure (that is, calorie burn) in a lab setting. Here’s how some of the top brands fared: Garmins underestimated calorie burn 69% of the time.Apple watches overestimated calorie burn 58% of the time.Polar devices overestimated calorie burn 69% of the time.Fitbits underestimated calorie burn 48% of the time and overestimated 39% of the time.The fact that Fitbits were roughly correct on average doesn’t mean they were useful. If sometimes your device overestimates and sometimes it underestimates, it’s not very helpful unless you know which is which. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nA 2018 review specifically of Fitbits found that accuracy varied greatly depending on factors like where they were worn (torso was more accurate than wrist), whether you were walking uphill, and whether you walked at a constant speed or stopped and started. The accuracy also varied by device, with the Fitbit Classic underestimating calorie burn and the Fitbit Charge usually overestimating. The devices just aren’t accurate enough to know how many calories you’re really burningA 2022 study compared the Apple Watch 6, the Fitbit Sense, and the Polar Vantage V. The researchers had volunteers wear all three gadgets while sitting quietly, walking, running, cycling, and strength training. Every gadget, for every activity, was awarded a judgment of “poor accuracy,” with coefficients of variation ranging from 15% to 30%.And this 2025 review of Apple Watch studies—the same one I mentioned above—found that calorie burn was, on average, off by about 18%. The authors mention a proposed standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission that recommends fitness trackers not be off by more than 10%. That's clearly not being met, although the researchers noted that newer models may be more accurate than earlier ones. To get a sense of these percentages, let's say your true calorie burn is 2,000 calories per day. A device that's off by 15% might report that you burned 1,700 calories, or that you burned 2,300. If you're using your device to figure out how much to eat, you could be way off in meeting your calorie goals. If these devices are all inaccurate, how can you know how many calories you're burning?It’s probably most useful if you think of your calorie burn as a number you cannot measure directly. Treat it as a black box: I burn some unknowable number of calories, now what? The only common reason you would need an accurate estimate of calorie burn is if you are trying to figure out how much food you need to eat. If you want to lose weight, you want to eat less than you burn; if you want to gain weight, you want the reverse; and if you’re trying to maintain your weight, you want to eat roughly the same as what you burn. But think about it this way: you don't actually need to know your calorie burn if you have the other two terms in the equation—your calorie intake, and your weight. It's considered more accurate to adjust how much to eat based directly on your weight, rather than using calorie burn estimates as a middleman. Let’s say you’re training for a marathon and you want to make sure you fuel yourself appropriately. Well, if you’re under-eating, you’ll start to lose weight. When you start to see the scale trending downward, that’s your signal to add a few hundred calories to your diet. If, after that adjustment, your weight stays steady, then you know you’re eating the right amount. As you increase your training (or if you take time off to rest a sprained ankle), you can make more adjustments as you go. I have a post here detailing how to make these adjustments with the help of either a paid app, a group of free apps, or a DIY spreadsheet. If you’ve been using a fitness tracker instead, and it’s working for you, feel free to keep using it. But if the tracker ever stops giving you the results you want, you can safely leave it out of the equation. \n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday When you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ Black Friday tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it is the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily bad, impulse buyers may not realize what they're purchasing.How to tell if a Black Friday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn order to avoid a low-key scam, you should do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). The bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Because so many of the new model's biggest features are hidden behind paywalls, it's not a bad deal, even if it's not the first time Google's done this. The deal follows similar promotions from April and August, although the most recent one ended in October. That this offer is coming so soon after the last one means Google might plan to keep rolling out these trials on a regular basis.How to claim your free year of Google AI Pro as a U.S. college studentTo get your free year of Google AI Pro, first head over to gemini.google/students and click Get Offer. You'll then need to log into your personal Google account, where you'll be prompted to verify your student status using SheerID. After that, Google says it should be a pretty straightforward signup flow, although being over a decade out of college by now, I'm not able to test it personally.Note that you will need to provide a form of payment, and that if you don't cancel the plan by the time the trail is over, your subscription will renew using your provided payment method. You also only have until January 31, 2026 to sign up for the trail.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe most likely error you're likely to run into is if your college isn't supported by the trial, which is handled by SheerID. Neither Google nor SheerID are being upfront about which institutions are and aren't supported, but Google says that if you run into issues, you can contact [email protected] or go to the SheerID help center.You also have to be older than 18, which means some freshman might have trouble signing up, and you cannot be on a supervised Google Account, or currently have a Google One subscription through either family sharing or a third party affiliate. Google says you can cancel an existing paid AI Pro plan to swap it for the trial, but you can't try to subscribe using the trial while applying a discount from buying a Pixel phone (which would theoretically apply after the free period ends).There's also some conflicting communication online. The current offer terms state you must \"be a resident of the United States,\" although the current help page for the trial still refers to previous offers, which were offered to other regions as well. I've reached out to Google for clarification, but for now, I would assume the offer only applies to those in the U.S. and expires on January 31, given the information in the Gemini 3 Pro press release.I've also reached out to Google about whether students who've already claimed the free year-long trial can extend their offer time by signing up for the new one, as while the help page mentions that \"new and existing Google one members,\" are eligible, it's unclear whether those already on a free trial count as proper subscribers. I'd guess the answer is probably no, but I'll let you know if Google tells me otherwise.What you get with your free year of Google AI ProYour free year of Google AI Pro comes with a free year of Google One Premium, too, which means it's got some benefits for you even if you're skeptical about AI.For AI users, Google AI Pro offers the following:Higher usage limits for deep research and recent models like Gemini 3 ProGemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3 Pro in AI ModeVideo generation with Veo 3.1 Fast and higher access to Google Flow and image-to-video generation in Veo 3.More remix generations and Veo 3 photo-to-video generations in Google photos1,000 monthly AI creditsIncreased NotebookLM accessHigher limits in coding tools including Jules, Gemini Code Assist, Gemini CLIGoogle Home Premium with Gemini features and 30 days of event historyFor everyone else, you'll still get 2TB of free cloud storage through Google One, which should be handy for all those assignments. Normally, when signing up for a Google One Premium Plan, you also have the option to bundle a YouTube Premium individual plan for a 14% discount, although it's unclear to me whether that's included in the trial, so I've also reached out to Google for clarity on this.And that's it! Personally, I wouldn't see myself using most of those AI features, but the 2TB of cloud storage is good enough that it's probably worth signing up for the trial just for that. Just remember to either be ready to pay the $20/month price once your year is up, or cancel before then.

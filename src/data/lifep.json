The sale runs through Cyber Monday.The Skullcandy Terrain Mini features Bluetooth 5.3, ensuring a stable connection within a 33-foot range. The battery is said to offer 14 hours of playtime, which should cover most day-long adventures or at least a solid workday playlist without needing a recharge. When the battery dies, it can be charged using a USB-C port, which is included, so you won’t need to dig through old cords. It also comes with a wrist strap that you can clip to a bag or swing around like a lanyard when you’re on the move. As far as sound quality goes, it's decent on its own, but the True Wireless Stereo feature allows you to pair it with a second unit for true stereo separation. You can also use Skullcandy’s Multi-Link to chain together up to 99 of these. Realistically, you’ll probably never do that, but the option’s there if you ever want to DJ a flash mob.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this speaker doesn’t punch far above its size. It’s built more for casual, portable listening than booming bass or high-volume precision. The fabric mesh helps with durability and sound clarity, but it won't replace your home speaker setup. If you’re in the market for a rugged little speaker that’s waterproof, rechargeable, and easy to toss in a bag, the Skullcandy Terrain Mini fits.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

You download the apps you want to use, log into your accounts, and presto: You can stream anything with a few clicks of your remote. But smart TV apps aren't the only way people watch shows and movies on platforms like Netflix. Among other methods, like plugging a laptop directly into the TV, many people still enjoying casting their content from small screens to big screens. For years, this has been a reliable way to switch from watching Netflix on your smartphone or tablet to watching on your TV—you just tap the cast button, select your TV, and in a few moments, your content is beamed to the proper place. Your device becomes its own remote, with search built right-in, and it avoids the need to sign into Netflix on TVs outside your home, such as when staying in hotels. At least it did, but Netflix no longer wants to let you do it.\nNetflix no longer supports casting on most devicesWhile you can still cast to your TV from other streaming platforms, there's bad news for Netflix fans: The company has abruptly dropped casting support for most devices. Android Authority was the first to report on the change, though you might have stumbled upon the development yourself when looking for the cast button in the Netflix app. In fact, Netflix has prepared for your confusion, as you can see from this Netflix Help Center page titled \"Can't find 'Cast' button in Netflix app.\" This page might offer a glimmer of hope at first, as you think \"Oh good, Netflix has a solution if the Cast button is missing.\" Unfortunately, the response isn't going to make you happy: \"Netflix no longer supports casting shows from a mobile device to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. You’ll need to use the remote that came with your TV or TV-streaming device to navigate Netflix.\"The exception here is for \"older\" Chromecast devices or TVs that work with Google Cast—but only if you pay for an ad-free Netflix plan. If you took Netflix up on its lower-cost subscription offer, those ads not only cost you extra watch time, but also your ability to cast—assuming you even have the older hardware to cast to. While Android Authority was the first major publication to report on the issue, some Netflix casters have been living with the change over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 14, this user posted on the Chromecast subreddit voicing their complaints about the change. They were particularly frustrated with the lack of communication from Netflix, as the Cast button was removed \"with zero warning.\" Other users in the thread noted their frustrations, too, with some threatening to cancel their subscriptions over the issue.  Why is Netflix removing support for casting?Netflix doesn't explain why it's making the change, so I can only speculate. First, it's totally possible this is simply a tech obsolescence issue. Many companies drop support for older or underused technologies, and perhaps Netflix sees now as the time to largely drop support for casting. Streamlining the tech the app has to support means less work for Netflix developers, and it wouldn't be the first time the company dropped support for older platforms. However, that doesn't really explain why the company still supports some devices for casting. Maybe it took a look at its user base, and made the calculation that enough subscribers relied on Google Cast devices for casting, but not enough relies on newer hardware for casting. We might not really know unless Netflix decides to issue a statement.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, I can't help but feel like this is related to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing. The company clearly doesn't want you using its services unless you have your own paid account—or have another user pay extra to have you on their account. Casting, however, makes it easy to continue using someone else's account without paying for it. Since Netflix only requires mobile users to log into the account owner's home wifi once a month to continue watching on a device, you could theoretically cast Netflix from your smartphone to your TV to continue enjoying your shows and movies \"for free.\" By removing casting as an option for most users, those users will either need to connect a device to the TV by wire—like a laptop connected via HDMI—or log into the smart TV app. And if those users don't actually have permission to access that account via that app, they won't be able to stream. If this really is the company's intention, it's doing so at the inconvenience of paying users, too. If you're traveling, you now need to bother with signing into your account on a TV you don't own. If you don't like using your smart TV apps, you're kind of out of luck, unless you want to deal with connecting a computer to your TV whenever you want to catch up on Stranger Things. How to fix Netflix casting issues with compatible hardware If you do meet the new requirements for casting on Netflix, and the cast button still isn't appearing, Netflix does have some troubleshooting steps you can take on its Help Center page. It's device-dependent, but generally, here's what you should do:Check your Chromecast's wifi network: You can ensure your Chromecast is actively connected to your wifi network from the Google Home app on your iPhone or Android device. Turn your device off and on again: If you're casting from your phone or tablet, power it off completely, then turn it back on again. Turn your Chromecast off and on again: If your device boots back up but the Cast button is still missing, power off and unplug your Chromecast for at least 15 seconds before turning it back on again. Sign out of Netflix: Log out of Netflix on the device you're trying to cast from. Turn off Chrome extensions: If you're using Chrome on a Mac or PC for casting, Netflix recommends turning off your browser extensions. (This seems like an extreme step in my opinion, especially if you're someone who relies on Chrome extension—but if it works, it works.)    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

With electronics in particular, that fresh price tag might mean getting tricked into buying a cheaper model of the thing you actually want. Or, you could be buying last year's model that has actually been on sale since the summer—maybe even at a better price a few months ago. Here’s how to avoid impulse buying a misleading Black Friday “deal” and make sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. Why you shouldn't impulse buy electronics on Black Friday or Cyber MondayWhen you see products like food, clothes, or home goods with a big ol’ \"Black Friday\" or \"Cyber Monday\" tag slapped on them, it's probable safe to take advantage of that deal. Chances are it's the same exact product you'd find on other days of the year. The same can’t be said for a TV. Many electronics sold during Black Friday are special \"doorbusters\" or retailer-exclusive models produced specifically for the holiday shopping season. These versions often feature cheaper components, fewer features, or lower specifications than their regular counterparts. A 55-inch TV from a reputable brand might look identical to the year-round model, but it could have a lower refresh rate, inferior panel technology, or fewer HDMI ports. So sure, you can go with the cheaper TV on Black Friday, but think about the value of what you’re buying.In the same vein, that \"amazing deal\" on a laptop might be on last year's processor or a smartphone that's about to be replaced. Retailers clear out aging inventory during Black Friday, and while the discount looks impressive, you're buying technology that's already outdated. The issue isn't that the tech is an older model, but that it has actually been at this low a price—or lower!—since the summer.Alternatively, some deeply discounted electronics are refurbished units or open-box returns that have been repackaged. Again, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, impulse buyers may not fully realize what they're buying.How to tell if a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale is a good dealThe key phrasing here is impulse buying. Black Friday is psychologically engineered to trigger impulse purchases. Limited-time offers, countdown clocks, and \"while supplies last\" warnings create artificial urgency that short-circuits rational decision-making. When you're caught up in the moment, it's easy to convince yourself you need a new tablet, smartwatch, or gaming console, even if you hadn't considered buying one before.To avoid a low-key scam, do your research. The easiest way to tell that you’re getting the correct product is by checking the model or serial number. And with online shopping, finding and double-checking those numbers is quick and easy.Seriously, don't just compare prices—compare specs. Look at processor speeds, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, refresh rates, and connectivity options. A $300 laptop isn't a deal if a slightly more expensive model offers significantly better performance that will last you years longer.If you do see a deal that catches your eye, it could pay to wait. Cyber Monday, post-Christmas sales, and even January clearances often feature electronics deals that rival or beat Black Friday prices, all without the famous chaos and pressure. Then again, you risk more “out-of-stock” results if you wait, so the risk is up to you, depending on the popularity of the item you’re eyeing (and how badly you want it). \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe bottom line: Don’t fall victim to a falsely-advertised lower-quality product, and make the most of holiday deals by doing a little research ahead of time. How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

You can now pick this versatile, reliable streaming box for $74.99 on Amazon, down from its original price of $99.99.\nLifehacker's review of the device highlights the smoothness of the user interface, the wealth of onboard storage, the bonus of having an Ethernet port (for steady internet access), and the benefits of the improved remote control—which you can actually make sound an alarm if you lose it. (Invaluable!)I've been using and loving Google TV for years, and the Google Streamer is a great way to access it. I like its broad support for multiple streaming apps, and the way it combines all those apps together—making it easy to see what you're currently watching. You can add to your watchlist from all across Google apps and services too, including Google Search.The streaming box and its associated remote are available in either Porcelain or Haze, so you can pick whichever matches your personal taste and internal decor. This 25% Black Friday discount may not last, so if you're interested, I'd recommend getting this bought as soon as possible.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Black Friday deals?Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

And here's the smart play: buying it now means you'll be ready to get ahead of the heat when spring training season rolls around.\nWhat the Core 2 doesThe Core 2 is a small plastic sensor that attaches to your heart rate monitor chest strap and tracks your body temperature during workouts. It's designed to help you understand how heat is affecting your performance, and guide you through heat-training protocols so you can adapt faster and more efficiently.My colleague Beth Skwarecki reviewed the Core 2 and found it a little fussy to set up, but easy to use and understand once you're up and running. What really impressed her was the big-picture view it provides: tracking how your body adapts to heat over time.Train hot, race coolThe data from the Core 2 serves two main purposes. First, it can guide your heat acclimation training—helping you adapt to hot conditions more strategically. Second, you can use it during races to monitor your core temperature and avoid overheating when it counts.As Beth points out, there's a legitimate debate about whether heat training makes sense for every athlete. You could argue that most runners would benefit more from longer or faster runs rather than adding heat stress to their training. But if you are training in the heat—whether because you live somewhere hot, you're preparing for a warm-weather race, or you're intentionally pursuing heat adaptation—the Core 2 seems to be an incredibly useful tool.Worth it for the right runnerAt nearly $300, this isn't an impulse purchase. But at $236, it's more accessible for serious athletes who want to take their heat training to the next level. Getting it now during Cyber Monday means you'll have months to familiarize yourself with the device before temperatures climb in spring and summer. By the time race season heats up, you'll already know exactly how your body responds to thermal stress—and how to manage it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Black Friday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. You can get the same Black Friday sales early, and we expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025. Are Black Friday deals worth it?In short, yes, Black Friday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech.

Since their release in 2022, the AirPods Pro 2 have received multiple software updates to add features such as controlling Siri with head movements, reduced latency, improved call quality, and more. Even today, they remain a fantastic pair of earbuds, especially now that the Cyber Monday 2025 sale has dropped the price to a record low.\nDuring Amazon-owned Woot's Cyber Monday 2025 sale, the AirPods Pro 2 are going for $135, which is 46% off the list price of $250. Sure, some of you are going to want the latest and greatest product in the lineup, the AirPods Pro 3 ($220, 12% off, during Cyber Monday 2025), but for most people, the AirPods Pro 2 are an amazing choice at this price.Every time I've used the AirPods Pro 2, I've been impressed by their comfort and noise cancellation features. The ANC cuts out a lot of noise in loud places, including concert venues, and for me, they've been a great companion on long flights.The AirPods Pro 2 work best with Apple products, but they're also compatible with other Bluetooth devices such as a Windows PC or an Android phone. Having said that, if you want to make the most of the AirPods Pro 2, you should pair them with your Apple devices for the seamless device switching, instant pairing, and host of software features that don't work with other platforms.I've used the AirPods Pro 2 during workouts at the gym, for cycling, and while running half-marathons. They've have never disappointed me through all these situations. I love recommending slightly older products when they're heavily discounted, and with the AirPods Pro 2 getting such a good deal during Cyber Monday 2025, you're basically getting a current-gen product at last-gen prices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Cyber Monday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

I stumbled upon this older one by Epicka and bought it almost without thinking, something I rarely do. That turned out to be one of my best purchase decisions ever, because that travel adapter is still going strong. I've taken it to multiple countries and have used it extensively while traveling to remote locations in India, where you don't always have a reliable power supply. Last year, I gave it away to a friend I met during a meditation retreat, and she's been happily using it since then.This is the first time I've had a travel adapter for that long. I'd bought a few crappy ones before, and they couldn't always reliably charge multiple devices or last very long. This Epicka unit was quite impressive in that regard, but it did have a couple of limitations. It was a fairly slow charger, and it had only one USB-C port. I've been looking to upgrade to a better travel adapter for about a year now, and I think I'm going to do it this time. Epicka has another model with three USB-C ports and support for up to 75W charging, which makes it ideal for me. That one is now down to its lowest ever price in a Cyber Monday deal.\nEven at the deal price of $45 (15% off), it is a bit pricey, but I think the premium is worth paying for a fast charger from a brand with a good track record. I will say that this product is a bit bulky, and some people will prefer to travel with a more compact charging adapter, but its size never bothered me much. You also get two USB-A ports (one on each side) in this adapter, which is good for those with older charging cables.This Epicka universal travel adapter has a 4.8 rating on Amazon, with a total of 336 reviews at time of writing. The general consensus among Amazon reviewers is that this is a great product. One review says that if you charge multiple devices, this adapter splits power evenly across the devices, which means that all devices will be charged reasonably quickly. It has plugs for the US, UK, Australia, and EU, and a nice locking mechanism to keep the plugs in place.Note, though, that if you're planning to use high-wattage electronics such as hair dryers with this adapter, then it's not for you. This adapter is also not a voltage converter, so be sure to check if your electronics ship with a built-in converter when using the Epicka adapter in other countries. Most phone and laptop chargers are dual voltage, so you probably won't have to worry about it much, but safety first.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

If I hadn’t bought my M4 Pro MacBook Pro last year, this is what I would probably get right now. The M5 chip is a substantial upgrade over the M4, especially in the AI department. And for Cyber Monday, Amazon is discounting the already fresh M5 MacBook Pro down to $1,349. That’s down from the sticker price of $1,599, a savings of $250.\nAt that rate, the M5 MacBook Pro becomes attractive for anyone who wants a Mac laptop that is going to last for ages. The M5 MacBook Pro is a sizable upgrade over the MacBook Air, too, thanks to its superior 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display (after using this, going back to my 4K monitor is really tough, I’ll tell you that). This XDR display has Mini-LED backlighting, a ProMotion 120Hz display, and 1,600 nits peak HDR brightness.The M5, meanwhile, is a new 10-core CPU that Apple says is 15% faster than the M4. The real gains are in graphics and AI. The new 10-core GPU comes with a neural accelerator integrated into each core. This boosts on-device AI workflows by up to 3.5 times. It’s a sizable jump if you’re running third-party on-device AI models as well. Graphics are better by up to 30%, too, with Apple’s third-gen ray tracing tech. Gaming on the Mac might finally be a no-compromise affair (although compatibility is still limited depending on the title).Along with 16GB RAM, there’s a 512GB SSD and a massive 24-hour battery life. The battery on my M4 Pro MacBook Pro isn’t as great as I’d want it to be. The M5 is more efficient, lasts longer and runs cooler as well. You can also use it for intense workflows like photo editing and video editing, and it can handle sustained thermal loads thanks to its built-in fan cooling. There’s also a nice 12MP Center Stage webcam up top, and a six-speaker sound system with Spacial audio. The speakers are genuinely amazing. When my wife and I watch something in bed, we no longer need to connect to Bluetooth speakers (like we do when using my wife’s MacBook Air).If you’re looking for something cheaper, or lighter, take a look at the M4 MacBook Air, which is deeply discounted to just $738 for Cyber Monday, another staggering deal.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Apple do Cyber Monday?Yes, Apple participates in Cyber Monday, though you may want to compare their sales with other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Apple is offering an exclusive $250 gift card for eligible purchases, but so far, the best Cyber Monday sale on an Apple product is the M4 MacBook on sale for cheaper than ever.Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, the distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

This is the lowest price ever, according to price-tracking tools. The other colors, including black, pink, and blue, are listed for $129 at Walmart and $129.95 on Amazon, which is also a decent deal at 35% off. \nThe Beats Solo 4 offer well-balanced sound and are particularly high-value for those in the Apple ecosystem. This is because Apple-owned Beats by Dre integrated features like hands-free Siri and personalized spatial audio into this iteration of the Beats Solo. The headphones also have one-touch pairing with most Apple devices, automatic pairing via iCloud, audio sharing, and simultaneous connection with your iPhone and Apple Watch. PCMag gives the Beats Solo 4 a \"good\" review. The headphones don't have Active Noise Cancellation, an adjustable EQ option, or an Android-friendly codec. Beats headphones, in general, are a decent affordable alternative to premium headphones from Apple and Sony. Its over-ear Studio Pro headphones are also on sale for Cyber Monday, as are the Apple AirPods Max and the Sony WH-1000XM6. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Black Friday and Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything. Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?Black Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online.

That's according to Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt . And I agree. I’ve used the Pixel 9a as my secondary phone for months now. For Cyber Monday, Amazon is discounting the Pixel 9a to just $349. That’s $150 off the original price, and it’s the lowest price we’ve seen yet.The Pixel 9a is a great phone for most people because of all the things that it has, and all that it doesn’t. It only has two cameras, and it doesn't have the Pixel 10’s fancy new AI features. But all that doesn’t matter, and you may actually prefer your phone without them.\nInstead, what you have here is a solid little dependable smartphone. It’s still got the same Tensor G4 processor as the regular Pixel 9, and you still get a 120Hz refresh rate display with the latest Android 16 OS. This thing is still as fast and smooth as the day it was launched. There’s 8GB RAM, which is enough to run some Gemini tasks locally, and fast enough for day to day use. At 5,100 mAh, it has quite a large battery backup as well. Not to mention Google's new 7-year software update promise, which also applies to the 9a. Because it uses smaller and older sensors, the camera is admittedly just okay. Don’t expect Pixel Pro level photos here. But for regular, everyday use, the camera will be more than adequate.The Pixel 9a has everything that a regular user would want from a smartphone, and could be a perfect gift for your parents or grandparents this holiday season. As Michelle puts it in her review, “But outside of being a good A-series phone, I also think it’s just a plain good phone.“\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow long do Cyber Monday deals really last?Black Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025.

You can now pick it up from Amazon for $549, its lowest price yet.\nThat \"lowest price yet\" label does depend on the color and storage option you choose, but whichever one you pick, there are big discounts being applied for Cyber Monday. For the biggest discount, pick the 128GB lemongrass model.I've been reviewing phones for decades at this point, and I've always loved the Pixel series (and the Nexus phones before that). They put photography and AI front and center—both high priorities for me—and they're perfect if you spend a lot of time in Google's various apps (from Gmail to Google Maps), which I do.These phones are also well-built, durable, and distinctive-looking. I find them easy on the eye, though you do need to get past that camera bar (it at least ensures your phone doesn't wobble when laid down on its back). Add in the on-board smarts of Gemini, and there's a lot to like here.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Cyber Monday deals?Yes, Amazon has Cyber Monday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem.

If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech. Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The deal runs through Cyber Monday. The standout here is that you’re not just getting a license for Visual Studio, which is already a powerhouse development environment, but also lifetime access to more than 60 hours of beginner-to-advanced coding instruction.Visual Studio Pro 2022 itself is widely used in professional environments, built for serious dev work—think C#, Python, .NET, and more. You get tools like IntelliCode for AI-assisted coding suggestions, built-in Git support, debugging, and advanced testing features, all of which are useful whether you're building a small app or working on enterprise-level projects. Normally, licenses for just the IDE can get expensive, so getting it bundled with a full curriculum covering JavaScript, React, Python, CSS, and more is the kind of package that feels designed for someone starting out with ambition or a side hustle in mind.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat said, this is a Microsoft-centric deal. If you’re aiming to become a Mac-based developer or work heavily with Xcode and iOS projects, this probably won’t be your best fit. The same goes if you’re already deep into development and just looking for a few advanced certifications, as some of the coursework may feel too foundational. But if you’ve been stuck in tutorial limbo, this bundle provides structure, software, and real-world tools at a reasonable price. For under $40, it’s hard to beat the value, especially for learners who want both a development platform and a guided roadmap in one place.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

The Oura Ring 4 remains one of the top holistic health trackers on the market, and right now it’s up to 30% off on Amazon (29% off for certain colors) for Cyber Monday, marking its lowest price ever. \nUnlike rings with an often boxy or bulky design (and even previous models of the Oura), this thin, rounded smart ring looks like a regular piece of jewelry and is comfortable to wear (even while you sleep). It lasts around a week off a single charge (a full day longer than the Samsung Galaxy Ring) and takes around 80 minutes to fully recharge.The ring provides accurate activity and sleep data (though it’s not as precise as wearables like the Apple Watch Ultra 2) along with personalized health guidance. For fitness enthusiasts, it also allows for the ability to track multiple workouts. The detailed metrics it provides help users get a better understanding of their holistic health, which is why it earned an Editors’ Choice award from PCMag for smart rings.It lets you track 40 different kinds of workouts, daily movement, sleep metrics, and stress levels, as well as health stats like heart and respiratory rate, blood oxygen, and skin temperature using red and green infrared LEDs. The app then delivers custom-tailored recommendations based on the results. That said, you’ll still need a membership to access some of the app’s deeper insights and features, unlike competitors like the Samsung Galaxy Ring, which costs more upfront but doesn’t have a monthly fee. If you don’t mind a subscription fee to unlock certain features and are seeking a long-lasting, comfortable wearable alternative to a smart watch that health and fitness tracker that provides a variety of around-the-clock metrics (and optimization tips via the app), the Oura Ring 4 has a wide breadth of features and is a sleek, unobtrusive option—especially at up to $150 off. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nDoes Amazon have Cyber Monday deals?Yes, Amazon has Cyber Monday sales, but prices aren’t always what they seem. Use a price tracker to make sure you’re getting the best deal, or refer to guides like our live blog that use price trackers for you. And if you have an Amazon Prime membership, make the most of it.What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?Nowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers that can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers on our live blog. Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?In short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially tech sales, home improvement supplies, and fitness tech.

The sale ends after Cyber Monday. Once you've purchased, the redemption code and setup instructions will be sent to your inbox. Just make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (like a 1GHz processor, 4GB RAM, TPM 2.0, and UEFI firmware, among others). This isn’t an upgrade path for unsupported PCs—it’s a fresh install for machines that meet the full list of Windows 11 Pro requirements.The Windows 11 Pro layout is cleaner, Snap Layouts and virtual desktops make multitasking smoother, and redocking windows actually works like you'd expect. If you’re into voice typing or just want better search across apps and docs, it delivers. Windows 11 Pro also includes some solid professional tools, such as BitLocker for encryption, Hyper-V for virtualization, and even a sandbox mode for testing apps safely. You’re also getting DirectX 12 Ultimate, so your hardware can shine during gaming or graphics-intensive tasks, assuming your machine is sufficiently powerful.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWindows 11 Pro also doubles down with biometric login, Smart App Control, and TPM 2.0 requirements, which makes it a tougher nut to crack. It also includes the new AI-powered Copilot and baked-in Microsoft Teams support, which might appeal to remote workers. Just a heads up, you won’t get an Office upgrade bundled in with this deal—this is strictly a Windows license. It will work alongside Office if you have a separate license, though (if you’re on a Mac using Parallels Pro).

Babbel makes it easier with practical, bite-sized lessons designed for real-life use, focusing on conversations you’d actually have—ordering food, chatting with the locals, asking for directions (read PCMag's in-depth review of Babbel to learn more)—and right now, its lifetime subscription is on sale for a huge discount: For Black Friday, a lifetime subscription to Babbel is on sale for $129 with promo code LEARN. The sale runs through Cyber Monday. It's a one-time payment—no recurring fees, no monthly charges—for lifetime access to all 14 languages (including French, German, Italian, and Spanish), making it cheaper than Babbel’s regular one-year plan at $300.Babbel’s lessons take just 10 to 15 minutes, so you can squeeze your practice into a commute or coffee break. And, unlike other language-learning apps that rely on repetitive vocabulary drills or random gamified exercises, Babbel follows a structured, linguist-designed curriculum that progressively increases in difficulty, so you don't plateau after the basics (earning itself a place in PCMag's \"The Best Language Learning Apps for 2025\" roundup). Plus, it’s not just passive learning—you get writing, speaking, and listening exercises with speech recognition technology to fine-tune your pronunciation, creating a far more immersive experience. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOf course, dedication is still key, and no app will make you fluent, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, this Babbel Black Friday deal gives you a lifetime subscription with the tools to succeed without the burden of ongoing costs.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Cyber Monday Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n\n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money\n        \n        \n            Daniel Oropeza\n            \n        \n        Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n    \n    \n        Add to Cart Newsletter\n            Shop smarter, save more money.

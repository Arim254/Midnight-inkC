NexShield pitched itself as a privacy-focused ad blocker from the developer of well-established and highly trusted uBlock Origin. However, as security firm Huntress found, the extension initiates a variation of the ClickFix attack that has been dubbed \"CrashFix\"—a reference to the browser crash that precedes the fake security warning and malicious command prompt. How NexShield's 'CrashFix' attacks your deviceAs BleepingComputer describes, the NexShield extension creates a denial-of-service (DoS) loop that exhausts your device's memory, ultimately freezing Chrome or Edge and causing it to crash. When the browser restarts, the extension displays a pop-up with a \"Run Scan\" button to identify \"potential security threats that may compromise your browsing data,\" leading users to believe that the crash resulted from a security issue. \nIf you follow through, you'll see another fake window with instructions for executing commands in the Windows command prompt. This is the ClickFix attack: a form of social engineering that relies on fake error messages, CAPTCHAs, and command prompts to trick users into deploying malware onto their own devices. In this case, the extension copies a command to the clipboard, and if users enter the keystrokes in the fake pop-up, downloads and executes a malicious script. After a 60-minute delay to avoid detection, NexShield delivers the payload that can run commands, fingerprint systems, and elevate privileges. Note that as of this writing, NexShield has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. How to protect your system from malwareIf you've installed NexShield, you should uninstall it and perform a full system cleanup to clear its payloads from your device. (We've got step-by-step guides to removing malware from your Mac and your PC.) \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs general protection against similar attacks, only install browser extensions from trusted sources. This isn't a guarantee that you'll never encounter a malicious add-on in the Chrome Web Store or in other browsers, as hackers occasionally manage to sneak through the approval process and even get their extensions labeled as trusted or verified. Some extensions are only later injected with malicious code, essentially \"waking up\" their ability to attack. Before installing a new extension, carefully check the creation date, reviews and ratings, and even the name, as malicious add-ons will often impersonate trusted ones (or, as in the case of NexShield, piggyback on legitimate brands like uBlock Origin). Watch for suspicious permissions—if the extension requests access to data or actions that seem excessive or are unrelated to its core function, it might be malware. Finally, never run codes or commands on your machine copied from websites or communication that you don't understand, and always verify instructions with an independent, trusted source. For this specific campaign, Huntress has other indicators of compromise you can look for on your system. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The bot generates a playlist for you based on your request.\n                                            These playlists take your entire Spotify listening history into account, as well.\n                                    \n            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Last month, Spotify announced \"Prompted Playlist,\" a new feature the company claimed let users \"steer the algorithm.\" This was a bold—if not vague—claim, to be sure, but it was backed by everyone's favorite tech trend of the last three years: AI. The pitch was that Spotify would let subscribers use the company's AI models to better control their listening experience, so long as they lived in the country of New Zealand. That's a very small slice of Spotify's very large user base. Luckily for those of us in the United States and Canada, Prompted Playlist is expanding to our side of North America. Spotify announced the move today, Jan. 21: Now, Premium subscribers in any of these three countries can access the feature, if they want to hand over the playlist reigns to Spotify's machine learning models.Prompted Playlist is Spotify's AI-powered tool that lets you use natural language to create custom playlists. The idea is, rather than look for songs to add to a playlist, you tell Spotify's AI what you're in the mood to listen to, and it adds songs automatically for you. That can include genres and existing songs, but also ideas, deeper descriptions, and, for lack of a better word, vibes. \nTo understand what I mean, here are some of the suggested prompts Spotify suggests you try: \"Make me a playlist of songs I’ve saved to my Library (playlists or Liked Songs) that I either haven’t played yet or have only listened to once. The goal is to round up those songs I found, saved, and then totally forgot to revisit. Give me a chance to finally hear what I’ve been missing.\"\"What are the first tracks I ever listened to on Spotify? Order them by the very first track I ever streamed - with date and time - and keep going.\"\"Knowing what I listen to today, make me a playlist of songs from 2016 that match my current taste, mixing the biggest tracks from that year with songs that feel timeless now.\"\"Make me a playlist to help me learn Spanish, with clear vocals and easy-to-follow lyrics. Mix popular Spanish-language songs with slower tracks that make it easier to catch the words, and include music that reflects different Spanish-speaking cultures to keep it engaging.\"Spotify says that Prompted Playlist takes your existing listening history into account as well. While you and a friend might give Spotify's AI the same prompt, in theory, you should each receive different playlists, since the AI will make adjustments based on the music you like and don't like. You also don't have to wonder why the AI put a specific song in the playlist: Each track starts with a \"quick one-liner\" that explains why Spotify chose it in the first place. I could see that being either insightful, or extremely annoying.The thing is, Spotify has rolled out a feature like this before, appropriately dubbed \"AI Playlist.\" Lifehacker's David Nield covered it in September of 2024, and catching up on that feature, it sounds pretty similar to Prompted Playlist. AI Playlist isn't actually going away now that Prompted Playlist is here: Spotify tells me that these are two separate features, and that the major differences are that Prompted Playlist factors in your entire Spotify listening history, going back to your first song, as well as real-time information about \"trends, charts, culture, and history\" in the industry today. You can also schedule playlists if you like, so the mix refreshes every day or week, something you can't do with AI Playlist.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFrom my seat, it also seems like Prompted Playlist is designed to handle more complex prompts, as well. While the company advertised AI Playlist as a way to build playlists from prompts like \"upbeat pop music for my road trip,\" the company's suggested Prompted Playlist prompts are much more intricate, and include multiple levels of instruction for the AI. Perhaps part of that is the result of improvements in the technology over the past year and half.  How to try Spotify's Prompted PlaylistPrompted Playlist is launching as a Premium-only feature, so if you don't pay for Spotify, you unfortunately can't access it. If you do have a Premium account, you'll need to head to Spotify, tap \"Create,\" then choose \"Prompted Playlist.\"As explained above, from here, you can describe what kind of playlist you want the tool to make. From here, you'll be able to set how often it refreshes (if it refreshes at all). If you're not happy with the results, you can choose \"Edit Prompt\" to adjust it. You can share the playlist with friends, but know that Spotify will adjust the playlist to match their listening histories instead. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

Discovery, it seems the company is actually adding new features to its subscription service. Netflix is always adding new shows and movies, which is what most users are looking for in the platform, but that's not all you can expect from your account. In fact, Netflix is now rolling out an interactive experience for its live competition shows, allowing subscribers to cast votes in real-time. Live voting comes to Star SearchNetflix announced the change in a press release on Tuesday, and also revealed the first show to officially run with real-time voting: Star Search. Netflix is bringing back the American Idol precursor tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT), and will allow viewers to choose which contestant they like best alongside \"millions of others.\"  Netflix says it first tested the feature with the show Dinner Time Live with David Chang, and \"learned firsthand how members appreciated the seamless and integrated ways they could participate in the series.\" I don't think you need a focus group to know that people like sharing their opinions on things, but then, I'm not a Netflix exec. \nThe company clarified in its press release that only live events will work with real-time voting. If you watch a show after it airs, you won't be able to cast your vote—which, obviously, makes sense. The show doesn't really need to know who you'd pick as a winner after the winner has already been chosen—though Netflix could always use the extra user data, I'm sure. Star Search is the only show at this time that supports this feature, but Netflix says more real-time voting shows are on the way.  \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to vote in live Netflix events\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Netflix\n                    \n    \nNetflix says that when you watch a live event, you'll be able to vote when watching on TV or a streaming device. You won't be able to vote if you're watching in a web browser, nor will you be able to vote if you rewind, pause, or tune-in late. When you join a live program, make sure you do so on a smart TV, supported streaming device (such as Apple TV, Fire TV, or Roku), or the Netflix mobile app. If you want to watch in a web browser, you can still vote on your phone at the same time. Netflix will prompt you when it's time to vote. You'll see a 1–5 star rating appear on the screen. Click on tap on the star level you want for each performer. Note that each profile only has one chance to vote per performance, so you can't issue another vote after you cast one—you'll just need to wait until the next performance. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.  As reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.Scammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended. \nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices. If you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.  As always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages. \n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

JustTheBrowser is a free and open source tool from developer and tech blogger Corbin Davenport that removes AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Basically, you can run this once and never think about these features again.To get started, head to the JustTheBrowser homepage. There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.Either way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing. On macOS, I needed to follow a few instructions to enable a configuration policy in the Settings app, something that only took a couple of clicks. After that, Chrome was free of any and all references to AI.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nA number of other features were also gone, including those annoying prompts to switch my default browser.The way this works is kind of interesting: it uses features intended for large organizations. Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.It's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing. The issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Big-budget titles, console-quality ports, and cloud streaming have turned phones into credible gaming machines. The problem is still input. Touch controls work until they don’t, especially once games demand precise movement, aiming, or long sessions. The Razer Kishi Ultra is built to fix that gap. And it’s currently $79.99 on Amazon, which online price trackers confirm is its lowest price to date. It fits most phones, even with cases, and can expand wide enough to hold an iPad mini, which gives it more range than controllers built only for phones.\nIn use, the Kishi Ultra feels closer to a traditional console controller than a typical snap-on accessory. It’s large and deliberately so, with thick grips that distribute the weight of your phone instead of cramping your hands. The triggers use Hall Effect sensors, which provide smoother movement and more consistent input than standard triggers, especially noticeable in racing games and shooters where partial pulls matter. The face buttons are mechanical and clicky, and the eight-way D-pad handles precise inputs well for fighting games and older titles. Razer also includes two extra programmable bumpers that can be mapped through its app, which helps in games that benefit from quick-access controls.That said, there are some trade-offs worth noting. The controller connects over USB-C, so it won’t work with older iPhones that still rely on Lightning. The wired connection does bring one upside: You can plug it into a PC and use it like a standard controller, which adds value if you move between platforms. On iOS, cloud gaming support can feel inconsistent with services like Xbox Game Pass, while Android tends to be smoother overall, notes this PCMag review. Still, if you want mobile gaming to feel closer to a console session, the Kishi Ultra makes a convincing case at this price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe Razer Kishi Ultra is a full-size mobile gaming controller that brings console-style controls to phones and tablets. It’s now $79.99 on Amazon, the lowest price it has hit so far, making it easier to justify if you want more precise controls for mobile or cloud gaming.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

    "body": "\n        \n        A workout habit has a way of building momentum: Once you’re doing something, anything, it’s easy to build on that. Video workouts are a simple way to get started, but if you're having trouble following along, I'm here to help. Below are some ways to make common exercises more accessible, and what to do if you can't get through a whole video yet.If you can’t squatLots of “easy” bodyweight programs ask you to perform a squatting motion without any added weight. But if that’s already more than you can do, try one of these instead: Sit in a chair, and stand back up. Lean your back against a wall and slide down until you’re in a sitting position (this is called a wall squat). Hold onto a countertop or the back of a chair while you do a squat. For any of these, it’s okay to squat as low as you can, even if that’s not all the way to parallel. You can work on going lower over time. \nIf you can’t do pushupsPushups are another move you’ll find in simple beginner workouts, but not everyone can do a pushup on their first day. Pushups get easier the higher your hands are, and harder the higher your feet are. So for the easiest beginner version, put your hands on a wall around shoulder height. Lean into the wall, then push yourself back to a standing position. Once those become easy, choose a lower surface, like a table or countertop. Then move to a chair, and so on. This progression is arguably better than doing pushups on your knees, because no matter which level you’re on, you are practicing holding your entire body straight in a plank position. If you aren’t ready to pick up weightsDumbbells come in all sizes—and fortunately for beginners, the smallest ones are also the cheapest. If your gym doesn’t have dumbbells small enough, any store with a sporting goods section will likely have some one- and two-pound dumbbells you can pick up and add to your gym bag. But if you’re not even ready for dumbbells, that’s okay. A half-liter water bottle weighs about a pound. Same with a can of soup. Larger water bottles, wine bottles, and milk jugs can take you up a bit further in weight; we did the math for you here. You can also hold books, roller skates, or tote bags full of literally anything. (Two water bottles in a grocery bag? That’s a two-pound weight.)Need to start even lighter? It’s okay to do weight workouts using literally nothing. Make your hands into fists and go through the motions. If you’re following a video that does a million reps of bicep curls or tricep extensions, your arms will get tired even if they’re empty. Just move up to the water bottles as soon as you’re ready. If you can't keep up with the pace of the videoWith these substitutions, you may feel ready to start following along with beginner level workout videos. But what if you can’t handle exactly what’s on the screen? Remember, your goal should be to do a workout at your current level of fitness, not to complete a certain number of reps that you theoretically could do if you were in better shape. So if the video asks for 30 seconds of pushups but you can only manage a few reps, do as many as you can and rest for the remainder of the time. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt’s fine to bounce from video to video until you find something at your level. Keep an eye out for one that seems like fun but is just out of your reach. Do it anyway, modifying it or resting as needed, and then bookmark it and come back to it next week. Chances are good you’ll be able to keep up a little bit better—and if you keep coming back to that same workout week after week, you’ll eventually master it. Consistency breeds momentum. If cycling workouts are too hardLet’s say you want to do a workout from a Peloton-like cycling instructor. You’ve got your bike, you can pedal, but pretty quickly you’re out of breath and feel like you can’t keep going.These workouts are easy to adjust: All you have to do is pay attention to the instructor’s voice and facial expressions and ignore any specific numbers. It doesn’t matter if she’s asking you for a “20” or a “50.” If the instructor looks and talks like she’s on an easy bike ride, adjust your resistance so you are on an easy bike ride. If she looks like she’s working hard but not dying, adjust your resistance so you are working hard but not dying.If you can’t decide where to startStart literally anywhere. There isn’t a wrong answer. Maybe you start doing cardio dance videos, but it turns out you hate dancing. Well, you’re already moving your body a couple times a week, so you can swap out the dancing for something else. Or maybe you start doing pushups every day, but after a while your wrists are aching. You can choose to address that problem and continue your pushups, or you can look back on how far you’ve come, congratulate yourself, and pick a different thing to try for the next chapter of your fitness journey. After all, you’ve already started, so why not keep going? \n            ",

Right now, it’s available at an all-time low price on Amazon: $509.99, 28% off the original $709.99 asking price.\nThe S25 FE comes in four colors and features a large 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2,340 x 1,080 pixels, a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, and a peak brightness of 1,900 nits. Unlike the higher-end Galaxy S25 Ultra, it doesn’t have an anti-reflective coating, though it still performs decently in moderately bright conditions. Rather than the Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, this model runs on a Samsung Exynos 2400 chip with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.The phone is lighter and more compact than the S24 SE. It has an under-display fingerprint sensor for biometrics as well as a face unlock option. According to PCMag’s tester, the 4,900 mAh battery lasts up to 17 hours (about two hours longer than its predecessor, but less than competitors like the Pixel 9a) and fast-charges in as little as an hour and fifteen minutes. While the cameras can’t compare to the line’s more expensive models, it does share two of its three rear cameras with the S25 and S25+, and will definitely deliver sharp images. It’s also a future-proof device, with Samsung promising up to seven years of updates and security fixes. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you’re looking for most of the flagship-style features as pricier S25 phones—including integrated AI tools, strong battery life, and quick performance—without paying flagship prices, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE checks all those boxes. And discounted to around $500, it’s more affordable than ever. It's a strong pick if you're upgrading from an older phone or making the switch to Android.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Microsoft's flagship work suite, which includes tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook, is currently experiencing issues impacting users. It's not yet clear exactly why these problems are occurring, but according to Downdetector (owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis) thousands of users are reporting issues.There are any number of causes that could trigger a widespread outage like this, and in all likelihood, Microsoft will have the issue isolated and fixed soon—especially considering how many companies and users rely on Microsoft 365 to function. But it does follow a number of high-profile outages this week. Yesterday, Yahoo! and AOL were both down. Last week, X experienced an outage, as did Verizon—quite famously, I might add. And this morning, Instagram was also down.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut joining that list as well is none other than Microsoft itself. These services were all down yesterday, too, making this the second day in a row. Again, it's not clear why Microsoft is experiencing these issues, but while we wait for a fix, there's not much you can do on your end. If your Microsoft apps are acting up, you can try to work with any of the offline tools you have access to. If you have other means of communication other than Teams, run with that. There's nothing short of Microsoft issuing a patch on its end that will bring back online functionality here.     \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

In a Reddit post, Strava said this feature builds upon Runna's already successful Instant Workouts feature. Instant Workouts uses your activity history to generate personalized workouts across four intents (\"Maintain,\" \"Build,\" \"Explore,\" or \"Recover\"). The idea is that the more you upload, the more personalized your recommendations become. Another major selling point is the automatic route generation feature, which draws on Strava's massive database of billions of historical activities to suggest optimal paths for each workout. The timing of this rollout seems deliberate as the company positions itself for its anticipated IPO. And on paper, it sounds like exactly the kind of innovation that would indeed justify a Strava subscription. In practice, however, the execution leaves a good bit to be desired.\nA half-baked launchUnfortunately, the feature's current implementation falls far short of its potential. The most glaring issue: You cannot actually view your workout details once you've started the activity in the app. Strava generates solid, complex, multi-interval workouts—but provides no way to reference them on your watch during your run or ride. You'd have to screenshot the workout beforehand or print it out.For the majority of us athletes who rely on our devices to guide interval training, pace targets, and recovery periods, this renders the feature practically useless. Strava has acknowledged this limitation in a Reddit post, promising that device integration for Garmin and Apple watches is \"coming soon.\" But the timeline for that \"soon\" is questionable at best.The relationship between Strava and Garmin has reportedly grown frosty following a lawsuit last fall, and there's little incentive for Garmin to prioritize features that primarily benefit Strava's subscription revenue and investor appeal. Without Garmin's cooperation and swift implementation, a significant portion of Strava's serious athlete user base remains locked out of the feature's full utility.Solid workout designOn the bright side, in my opinion, the workouts themselves show promise—though others disagree. The training plans generated appear to take into account individual fitness levels reasonably well. From my testing, the prescribed intervals, pacing, and progression made sense given my current training status and recent activity history. \n    \n            \n            These all make sense for me.\n                                        Credit: Meredith Dietz\n                    \n    \nThat said, user experiences vary considerably. Some athletes report receiving workouts that seem disconnected from their actual fitness or goals, while others note that the workout descriptions use non-standard terminology that doesn't align with how most training plans communicate intervals and pacing.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThen there's the route generation. In a well-traveled area with dense activity heat maps like New York City, my suggested routes tend to be solid and sensible enough. As always, my personal preferences are to avoid extra crowded streets or sketchy areas, which Strava never seems to take into account. Ultimately, the algorithm benefits from years of crowdsourced data showing which streets, paths, and loops are actually popular with runners and cyclists.However, users in less densely populated areas or regions with sparser Strava usage report wildly inconsistent results. Some routes make no logical sense, sending athletes on inefficient paths or suggesting roads that aren't suitable for the prescribed workout type. The feature's quality appears directly tied to the richness of local Strava data, creating a drastic two-tier experience.And once again: Until I can push the workout and corresponding map to my watch, this feature doesn't mean much to me.The bottom lineIf you ask me, Strava's Instant Workouts feature feels rushed to market, likely timed to generate positive press ahead of the IPO rather than to actually serve athletes. Basic functionality that should have been present at launch—like being able to see your workout in the app or send it to your watch—is mysteriously absent. The wonky workout descriptions and inconsistent route quality only compound the sense that this needed more time in development.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    ",

One of their award-winning models is the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 power station, which is currently available at a 46% discount, bringing it down to an all-time low of $1,999 (originally $3,699).\nCompared to Anker’s most powerful model, the SOLIX C2000 with a 2,048Wh capacity, EcoFlow’s Delta Pro 3 nearly doubles that at 4,096Wh and is expandable to up to 48000Wh. It supports 120V/240V voltage and can be recharged in a variety of ways, including solar panels, AC outlets, gas generators, and EV charging stations. It’s powered by a lithium iron phosphate battery, which is longer-lasting, safer, and tolerates more cycles than many competing power stations on the market.Compared to a gas generator, it operates quietly and doesn’t give off dangerous exhaust fumes, so it’s suitable for indoor use. It can be controlled and monitored via a companion app that tracks generation and power usage history and calculates the estimated time until empty. Although PCMag, which gave it an Editor’s Choice Award, calls it “elegant-looking,” it’s an undeniably heavy device at over 100 lbs due to its massive output, so it’s not as portable as many competitors. This makes it better for vehicles or semi-permanent setups rather than camping trips or hiking. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you want a serious backup power solution for your home and your priorities are a high power capacity with expandability, versatile recharging options, and a quiet, indoor-friendly alternative to a gas generator, the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 power station is your best bet, especially at nearly half off. However, if you only need to power small devices or use it for travel, it will most likely be overkill, and a cheaper model from the Anker SOLIX line (or the Ecoflow River 2) might be better for your needs.\n            \n                    Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n                \n            Deals are selected by our commerce team\n                            \n        \n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

This included the ability to use navigation apps in your car, send work emails or messages, or make calls outside of SOS mode, which basically limited you to emergency services. Worse, some users are still experiencing issues this morning following Verizon's official resolution, though there's likely a quick fix for that.I don't have Verizon, but if I did, I'd be a bit ticked off. Outages happen, but this one was massive, and the company still hasn't offered much of an explanation for what actually happened. In spite of this (or perhaps because of it), the company seems keen to smooth the whole thing over. When Verizon announced it had resolved the outage, it also said it would reach out to affected customers directly to issue account credits. It's a pain to deal with interruptions to services as important as your wireless network, but at least Verizon wants to compensate you for the problem, right? Just don't expect much.Verizon's account credits might seem a bit lowVerizon made a post on X, once again apologizing for the outage and revealing what each affected account can expect to receive as compensation: $20. \n\n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nVerizon says this number represents \"multiple days of service\" on average, and that no credit can make up for what happened. That might be true, but in my humble opinion, a larger credit could perhaps get a bit closer. Maybe this is greater than the on-paper dollar value of losing a day of service, but it's not like customers think of their bills as paying for their usage. They pay Verizon quite a bit, expecting that their smartphones to be connected at all times within Verizon's coverage map. Considering the upheaval a day of disconnection no doubt caused, I'm not sure $20 is going to cut it.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut I digress: $20 is the number, and $20 is what affected customers can expect to receive. If you're among them, Verizon says they will text you when the credit is available. When it is, you can log into the myVerizon app to claim your recompense.        \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

I grew up in the era of headphones, and never quite liked the idea of sticking something into my ears on the regular. If that sounds like you, Sony's got your back. Its newest earbuds, the Linkbuds Clip, are clip-ons.Sony's not the first brand to take this idea to market—Anker's Soundcore brand has a number of more affordable options. But for premium clip-on earbuds, it's pretty much this, the slightly more expensive Bose, and the slightly sportier Shokz.Compared to that competition, Sony's new model is looking like a solid choice. These earbuds fit snugly around your ear with an adjustable ear cushion, and include the niceties that Sony's Linkbuds have become known for. That means an optional built-in voice boost mode to help you hear vocals better; adaptive audio that can raise or lower your volume based on your environment; a motion sensor for tapping gestures (which you can actually perform near your ear instead of on the earbuds themselves); and—new with this model—a bone-conduction sensor.\nSony's pitching that last bit as being especially good for calls, as the bone conduction sensor will be able to detect specifically when you are speaking, and, working alongside some \"AI noise reduction,\" should be able to reduce background noise.Battery life has also been improved over Sony's last Linkbuds, the Linkbuds Open. There, you got 22 hours of battery life with the case, but here, Sony is promising up to 37. The buds themselves should provide up to nine hours of battery life.Speaking of the Linkbuds Open, that model also had a unique design, as the bulk of the earbud was designed to sit in your upper ear, while a ring that actually produced the sound sat just outside your ear canal. It was a design that aimed for an experience akin to \"open-back\" headphones, meaning you'd be able to completely hear your surroundings with the earbuds in without needing a transparency mode. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sony\n                    \n    \nThe Linkbuds Clip want to keep that same open-back experience, while allowing for greater comfort and flexibility. Sony told me that the Linkbuds Open do sit closer to the eardrum if worn correctly, which can provide a better listening experience, but that differing ear shapes made it hard for some customers to use as intended. I was sent a pair of Linkbuds Clip for review, and while I haven't had much time to test them yet, I can confirm that they fit pretty snugly on my ears right out of the box.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nOver the next week, I'm excited to try the Linkbuds Clip both while out and about in New York City, and while exercising. Aside from enhanced comfort over in-ear earbuds, you'll be fully aware of your surroundings while wearing these, which should help with safety or any spur-of-the-moment conversations you might need to have (Sony is also marketing these towards parents who might need to constantly keep an ear out for their kids). I also sometimes feel like my in-ear earbuds can block airflow while I'm doing cardio, which I worry makes it harder for me to cool off, so I'm curious to see if these can help with that.The one downside is that, as is the case with open-back headphones, there can be some sound leakage, which means others might be able to hear whatever you're listening to. That's something I'll need to test over time, although Sony does say it has an optional sound leakage reduction mode.There's also no noise canceling, but that's to be expected when the idea is to stay aware of your surroundings.I've been a big fan of Sony's audio products over the years, especially its software and listening modes. My full review of the Linkbuds Clip will be coming soon, but if you're already convinced, you can snag your own pair for $230 over at Sony's website, or through stores like Amazon. The case comes in four colors, but you can also grab a silicone case cover, which covers half of the case, to help you mix and match over on Sony's website for $12.50. Extra air cushions of any color are also available alongside upper case covers, while bottom case covers come with a keychain.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).It sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.In Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to set up App Pairs with 90:10 split screen multitaskingTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Khamosh Pathak\n                    \n    \nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

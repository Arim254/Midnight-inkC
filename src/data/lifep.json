If you've ever searched online for a specific tech problem you've read Justin's work, because he's been doing it for a long time. Since 2009, he has written tutorials and essays about technology for outlets including WIRED, The Atlantic, PCMag, Popular Science, How-to Geek, and The Wall Street Journal. For Lifehacker, he mostly writes about software, with a particular focus on open source programs and indie apps. Justin has a bachelor's degree in Communications and International Relations. He once worked in marketing for a software company and hated it, but it did teach him a lot about why software tends to get worse over time in large companies. He lives in Oregon with his cat (and his wife). He enjoys brewing beer, exploring nature, and spending time with friends.

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications. Maybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.The application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).The whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.It's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.I don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.RCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.To check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.Go to Messages > RCS MessagingEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.And that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default. Still, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make. Despite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.  Parents can still supervise their 13 year olds' Google Accounts Luckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\") \nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nSpeaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhat does this mean for my child's Google Account?As I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.But now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end. It's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same. \n            \n    ",

Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great. Microsoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless. Microsoft's \"Handoff\" moment is coming   As spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps. \nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board. \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nAs Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.  It's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability. How to enable Resume on WindowsThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.  \n            \n    ",

For example, that seemingly endless time spent shivering in the shower while you wait for the water to heat up. Or that painful moment when you go to wash your hands and water that feels like it’s being pumped directly from the Arctic splashes you.Waiting for the water to heat up is an age-old problem caused by simple laws of physics: Your water heater is far away from the tap or shower head, and it takes time to flush out the cold water in the pipes. But there are ways to speed up your hot water delivery. The easiest is to install a tankless water heater, but those can cost thousands of dollars to install, and require a lot of space your house may not have. If you want to speed up your hot water without taking on that much of an expense, you have a few more affordable choices.Install a recirculating pumpOne reason it takes a while for hot water to arrive is time: When you turn off the faucet, the hot water sitting in the pipes starts to cool off. The next time you turn on the tap, that cooled water has to be pushed out of the hot water pipes before the hot water can arrive.\n\n            Never miss a story\n                Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n            \n        \nTo solve this, you can have a recirculating pump installed at a cost typically under $1,000. These pumps are installed on your existing water heater, and work by continuously circulating the water in the pipes so it never sits there, cooling off. Because it’s installed at the water heater, it speeds up hot water to your appliances, as well, including washing machines and dishwashers, which can help them operate more efficiently.Point-of-use tankless heatersWhile a whole-house tankless water heater can be a big and expensive project, what’s known as a “point-of-use” tankless water heater can be a more manageable and affordable solution. These are small enough to install under a sink, and are designed to provide hot water on demand just at that point of use. The heaters themselves typically run a few hundred bucks, with installation typically running less than $1,000. Because of their small size, it’s feasible to install one of these yourself if you’re comfortable with plumbing and electrical work, but they can require careful calibration, so hiring a professional plumber is probably your best move.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nInsulateSince part of the problem with slow hot water is heat loss as the water sits in the pipes, you can sometimes improve the situation just by insulating your hot water pipes thoroughly. This is definitely a DIY job if you can identify and access your hot water pipes, and it’s not a terribly expensive job to hire out, costing as little as $350 on average. It’s just a matter of wrapping the pipes with insulating cuffs, then taping everything off so it’s sealed up nicely. This can help keep water hot while it sits, so the next time you turn on the faucet, you get the hot water you expect.Adjust restrictorsCold water has to drain out of your pipes for the hot water to hit your faucet or showerhead, so one possible way to speed things up is to remove any flow regulators/restrictors that have been installed. These simple devices do exactly what it sounds like: They restrict the flow of water, conserving energy and water and keeping your utility bills lower. But since they restrict flow, they also mean it can take longer for cold water to drain off and hot water to arrive, so removing or adjusting them can reduce the time it takes for that hot water to get to you.\n            \n    ",

While some users love the new Liquid Glass design across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, others decidedly do not—which is likely what led Apple to introduce a dedicated setting to control the intensity of the effect. I'm partial to it, but I understand for some users, it's a tad too much, especially if it makes certain UI elements more difficult to see. But Liquid Glass isn't the only thing Apple users have complained about, especially with regards to macOS Tahoe. Mac users reported various problems with performance and stability across macOS 26.0 and macOS 26.1, and have criticized design choices like overly rounded corners. Myself, I held out on updating my M3 Pro Mac until macOS 26.2, where many of these issues appeared to be fixed, but my M1 iMac is still on macOS Sequoia for the time being. All that to say, macOS 26 hasn't had the smoothest start compared to some of Apple's previous Mac updates. If you've been noticing, for example, that your Mac's window management isn't as cooperative as it's been in the past, you're not alone. In fact, there seems to be a clear explanation for what's behind the issues. The issue with windows on macOS TahoeAs with other versions of macOS, you can resize and adjust your Mac apps' windows by clicking and dragging from the bottom corners. The issue, however, is that as of Apple's newest update, it can be fairly difficult to grab the corner of the window. You might, instead, find you click on the bottom corner of the app or website instead, leading to unintended actions. Clicking the top right corner of Chrome, for example, will drag the whole app window, rather than resize it. Clicking the bottom left corner and dragging will start to highlight everything in the app window instead, perhaps sending you all around the screen as well. \nIf you slowly hover your cursor over the corner of the window, eventually you'll find a spot that turns your cursor into a resize icon, and you'll know you're good to click and drag to resize. But why is this so much more difficult to do quickly than it was in macOS Sequoia or beyond?\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nNorbert Heger, a software developer, seemingly has an answer. In a blog post on Sunday, Heger explains that those rounded corners Apple designed for Tahoe are having a negative impact on the clickable area of the window. With a square corner, most of the clickable area—Heger says 62% of it—lies within the corner of the window itself. That gives users a relatively large area to click within the corner in order to grab onto the window, and a little bit of room outside the window to click, as well. But these new rounded corners don't seem to take that into consideration. Instead, they're relying on the same click area as before, but because there's less corner to work with now, the actual clickable area of the window is far less. Heger says about 75% of the clickable area now exists outside the window itself, giving users just 25% to work with in the actual corner of the window. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're running macOS Tahoe, you can try this out for yourself right now: Move your cursor to the corner of the window, and wait for it to change into the resize icon. If you're hovering within the window itself, it won't change until you're just about to move outside the window. You can keep going a bit, and see you can get pretty darn far outside the window before the cursor changes back. \n    \n            \n            Why am I able to resize the window from outside the window, Apple?\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThis seems like a relatively easy fix on Apple's part, assuming they're aware of the issue. Maybe a patch will even make it into macOS 26.3. That said, the company has not publicly acknowledged the quirk, so it's anyone's guess. Until a potential fix, those of us on macOS Tahoe will just need to retrain our muscle memories around window resizing. For anyone who hasn't upgraded yet, you can simply carry on as usual. \n            \n    ",

But previous models were held back because of its Tizen OS—while marketed as a monitor, Odyssey was really a TV in disguise. With the new G81SF model, Samsung has finally fixed it, returning the G8 to a proper monitor setup. And Woot is currently offering the 32-inch model at a deep discount: $769.99, $540 off the $1299.99 retail price.The removal of the Tizen OS means no software bloat, and no waiting for the TV menu to boot up before shifting to your desktop. You do lose out on the built-in speakers, but it's a worthy sacrifice.The monitor features an RGB ring at the back, with its CoreSync feature creating an ambient lighting effect by projecting the on-screen colors onto the wall behind the monitor. There's also fan-less cooling via a pulsating heat pump, which allows it to run completely silently and without a fan, while reducing burn-in risk. These are critical features in high-end QD-OLED displays. (You also get a large array of ports. Two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, USB-A hub, and a headphone jack.)\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIn its review of the earlier model with the Tizen OS, PCMag gave it a 4-star \"Excellent\" rating, and the display panel and specs remain the same in the model currently on sale. According to PCMag's expert review, \"Rocking a full 4K resolution (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) at a maximum 240Hz refresh rate, the monitor looks fantastic and plays even better... [It] excels for gaming and does everything else to a very high standard too.\" It's a good buy, especially at this price.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching. YouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one. If you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search. \nHow to remove YouTube Shorts from searchTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nUnfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.Other changes to YouTube filtersIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.    Finally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters. \n            \n    ",

Some devices are more bloated than others: Google Pixels have a relatively \"clean\" build compared to Samsung phones, for example, and don't typically come with third-party apps and games. But you may still want to eliminate apps and features that clutter your home screen, take up valuable space, and create a drag on performance, especially if you have alternatives you like more. On Android, that likely means uninstalling what you easily can and disabling everything else. What you can (and can't) uninstall on AndroidUnfortunately, many preinstalled first-party apps can't be easily removed. This varies by manufacturer and device—for example, Pixel users can uninstall Google Play Games and Books but are stuck with Chrome, Drive, Maps, and Calculator. As HowToGeek points out, you can delete other pre-selected Google apps added during initial setup, such as the Pixel Watch app and NotebookLM. \nOn Samsung Galaxy phones, again, some preinstalled bloatware is locked in, but ZDNET calls out five native apps that most users should delete right away: Global Goals, Samsung Free, Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Shop, and Samsung Kids. To uninstall an app on your Pixel, go to the Google Play Store and tap the Profile icon. Tap Manage apps & devices > Manage, select the app you want to remove, and tap Uninstall. On Samsung, go to Settings > Apps, tap the app name, and tap Uninstall > OK. You can also touch and hold the app icon on your home screen and tap or drag to uninstall. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf you're absolutely set on removing preinstalled apps that can't be deleted using the above steps, you can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), but these methods are more advanced. How to disable preinstalled appsBuilt-in apps that aren't in use can be disabled, which hides the icon from your app drawer. They'll still take up space, but at least they'll be out of sight. Most preinstalled apps can be disabled if you don't need them, with the exception of critical system apps. On your Pixel, go to Settings > Apps > See all apps to select individual apps, and tap Disable at the top of the screen. You can hide preinstalled Samsung apps from your home screen settings: tap Hide apps and tap the icon of the apps you want to disable, the press Done. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.The good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.Keep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Determining what goes on that list and in what order, though, is a task all its own. I've covered a lot of ways to do that, but if you're stuck with a high volume of important responsibilities, you need an approach that matches the complexity of what you're trying to do—and that's where the RICE method comes into play.What is the RICE method of prioritization?RICE, as you probably guessed, is an acronym. Here's what it stands for: Reach: How many people or parts of your life or project this task will impactImpact: How meaningful that impact will be if and when it's done correctlyConfidence: How sure you are about your estimates of the other three factorsEffort: The time, energy, knowledge, and resources requiredA unique combination of those factors is going to give you guidance on which tasks are the most crucial to prioritize, which is helpful when you're overloaded by information and dread, unable to think about when or where to get started. \nHow and when to use RICEI won't lie to you: This method is more convoluted than some of the others I've covered in the past. I might even recommend trying a simpler prioritization technique, like the Eisenhower matrix, before you try this one and only whip this out if Eisenhower or its peers aren't given you solid results. RICE takes a little time—and that's because you need to do some math. \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \nStart by writing down all your tasks. Under each, you're assigning numbers. The Reach score will be the number of people or parts of your life or project that the task will impact and the Impact score is a 3 (massive impact), 2 (high), 1 (medium), .5 (low), or .25 (minimal impact). Confidence should be a 100, 80, or 50, to represent the percentage of confidence you feel in your estimates and abilities. You can use any number between 0 and 100, but falling back on those three just makes it easier. Most adherents of this method use a complicated math equation (determining \"person-months\") for Effort, but I'm going to simplify that for you. Score it the same way you scored Impact, with a 3 for multiple days or resources, 2 for a day, 1 for half a day, .5 for an hour, and .25 for a half an hour or less. You can also score Reach that way if you're working on a personal project and your results won't necessarily reach a big number of people. In that case, think about the different areas of your life or personal goals it will affect and use that 3-to-.25 scale. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThat part is all subjective, similar to using the ABCDE method to assign grades to your to-dos. It can't be avoided—you won't know the true resources required or reach of the project until it's done—but you can quantify it a bit. Next, you do math. It's R x I x C divided by E. You'll end up with a numerical score for each task. Rank the tasks in descending order, with the biggest numbers first. Obviously, you may find that some can't be completed until others are done, so use your discretion there, but for the most part, you've just created a clear outline of which things will have the biggest impact and reach and you can at least know where to start. Add each into your calendar using time boxing and time blocking, then get after it. Knowing you have a plan of attack is half the motivational battle.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        There are many good reasons to get a VPN (Virtual Private Network) app installed on your phone or laptop: They make it harder for anyone else to track your browsing, they keep your data safe when you're on public wifi networks, and they even let you spoof your location so you can access geolocation-locked content.You'll also find plenty of choice when it comes to VPNs. Our own guides to the best paid VPNs and the best free VPNs show the wealth of impressive apps out there, and even when you narrow down the criteria, you've still got lots of options to pick from—see our recommendations for the best free VPNs for Android.So what exactly should you be looking for when it comes to choosing the right VPN for you? These are the features and selling points that you'll see mentioned when you're browsing VPN comparisons, and what they mean (and once you've built up a shortlist from these criteria, then you can look at the prices and extras).\nBrowsing speedOne of the downsides of loading up a VPN is that your browsing speed can suffer, while your data gets pinged around multiple servers across the globe. Ideally, you want all the protection that a VPN offers, without too much of a hit on download and upload rates (no matter how many other people are using the same VPN).Unfortunately, this isn't really something you can gauge just by looking at VPN listings and ads, as most VPNs will claim to be the fastest. Either read benchmark tests put together by publications and authors you trust (watch out for sponsored content), or make use of as many free trials as you can and do some testing yourself.Server locations\n    \n            \n            Even VPN service will tell you how many servers it has, and where they are.\n                                        Credit: ExpressVPN\n                    \n    \nYour VPN of choice needs to reroute your internet traffic somewhere, and how many servers a particular VPN has around the world can make a substantial difference to speed and availability. It's also going to determine where in the world you can pretend to be of course, if you want to jump to another country virtually.Broadly speaking, the more servers the better, though as with VPN speeds you may have to do some testing of your own to check reliability and transfer rates. Look for server locations close to you (for speed), and outside of heavily censored or surveilled countries (for privacy), and check any technical specs that are given for them.Split tunneling and kill switchesSomething else to look out for is split tunneling, or the ability to send only some of your internet traffic through a VPN. This means you get better speeds (and less security and privacy) on data that's not so important, if you're just reading the news or learning a language. It's a feature that many of the best VPNs now offer.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nAnother feature worth checking for is a kill switch. It sounds rather dramatic, but it's simply a feature that shuts down your internet connection if the data encryption somehow fails—cutting you off from the internet, but preventing your connection and data from being exposed. Again, this is now fairly common, but not every VPN offers it.No logs or zero logs\n    \n            \n            Mullvad VPN lets you pay by cash, if you don't want to enter payment info.\n                                        Credit: Mullvad VPN\n                    \n    \nYou should only consider VPNs that have clear no-logs policies (no browsing data is permanently retained) or zero-logs policies (supposedly even stricter, covering more data). Don't take the VPN's word for it. though: Look for third-party audits from independent security companies, carried out regularly, to verify these claims.If these logs are retained, they might be sold to data brokers, or pulled by law enforcement agencies—so check the individual privacy policies for details of what happens when you're connected to your VPN. Some VPNs go above and beyond when it comes to letting you stay anonymous: Mullvad VPN lets you pay by cash through the post, for example.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nVPN protocolA VPN protocol is the way that the VPN connects to the internet at large: It makes a major difference to speed and security, and you'll often see it mentioned in VPN listings. However, as important as it is, it's not something that's easy to compare across different VPN services—most VPNs will simply say their protocol of choice is the best.Once you've got a shortlist of VPNs together, do some background reading on the protocols they use: Look for independent assessments of their security and transparency, technical benchmarks, and protocols that have been open sourced so they can be analyzed. OpenVPN and WireGuard are two well-regarded protocols, for example.Location and reputation\n    \n            \n            Where a VPN is based is important, as well as where it connects to.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nVPN companies are bound by the laws and regulations of the country that they're based in—so it's a good idea to look for ones based in places where surveillance regulation and government monitoring is less strict. If necessary, check the VPN's policies on how it deals with data requests from the authorities and law enforcement in its local region.It's also worth weighinga VPN company's reputation: How does it make money? What other services does it offer? What's its record with data breaches? This is much more important with a VPN than it is with your streaming music provider, for example, because you're trusting it with all of your online data while you're connected.Trials and money backGenerally speaking, it's worth paying for a VPN, as you're giving it so much responsibility in terms of your online access and security. The paid options are almost always going to give you a faster and more reliable service, and if you regularly make use of a VPN then the monthly fee is well worth the investment.It is, however, worth looking for services that offer free trials and your money back if you're not satisfied (usually after 30 days). Not only does it reflect well on the VPN company, it means you can see if the VPN suits your needs—and check how fast its servers are—before signing up for any kind of payment plan.\n            ",

Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face. You wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.Taken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.The ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.\n            \n    ",

Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.Hardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.I suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field). \n            \n    ",

As a dog owner, I know I don't. But fires do happen, and pets can't follow your family fire plan. Rescue Retriever wants to change that. I spoke with the company during CES' Pepcom event, and learned how it's working to make it easier for firefighters to find your pets in the event of a fire. (Rescue Retriever first launched back in March of 2024. The company was started by two brothers—one of whom is a former firefighter.)During a fire, pets tend to run to where they feel safe—maybe that's under the bed, or somewhere tucked away in a room. That makes it difficult for firefighters to locate pets during an emergency: In a situation where seconds count, they don't have the ability to search every corner of a burning home. Unfortunately, as a result, pets sometimes don't make it out. Rescue Retriever wants to change that.Rescue Retriever's smoke detector is installed near your pet's safe spaceIn an attempt to solve that problem, Rescue Retriever's smoke detector works a bit differently. It isn't supposed to be placed where your current smoke detector is; rather, the idea is to place it where your pet is most likely to go when scared. If you know they like to hide under your bed, for example, you can place the detector there. Once the device detects smoke during a fire, a bright light begins to strobe inside, spread out by a mix of holes placed throughout the device. (Even under the bright lights of Pepcom, the strobe looked intense to me.) That way, firefighters can look out for the strobing lights when trying to locate pets in your home. There's even an accompanying sticker you can place on your home's window, so firefighters know you have a pet to look out for.\n\n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \nThe device is silent, so as to not scare your pets away from their hiding space. It wouldn't do any good to have a beacon for firefighters to locate your pet, only to have them scurry off because of an alarm. The Rescue Retriever Fire Tag lights up in an emergency\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nNew from the company this year is the Fire Tag, which brings the strobe light from the main unit to a small tag you can place on your pet's collar. The tag syncs up to the main unit using RFID. When the main unit detect smoke and starts strobing, the Fire Tag will pick up the signal and follow suit. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIt's great that the main unit doesn't make a noise to scare your dog, but that doesn't guarantee they will go to the spot where the smoke alarm is installed—maybe the house smoke alarm scares them again or they don't follow their usual pattern and hide somewhere away from where you placed the main unit. Having a Fire Tag on their collar would give firefighters a better shot at locating the pet, wherever they may be in the home. Rescue Retriever tells me these tags have a range of up to a quarter mile, so if your dog runs away from your house, their collar might still light up. Even still, the Fire Tag opens up, allowing you to place a tracker like an AirTag inside, so if your dog runs out of that quarter mile range, you can still track them if they come within Bluetooth range of a device within the Find My network.  Rescue Retriever says the Fire Tag is ready for production, and, when available, can be purchased either individually ($29.99), or as part of a larger bundle with the main Rescue Retriever unit ($89.99). The main unit can be purchased now for $39.99, but it also comes in bundles with accessories for varying prices.\n            \n    ",

/><p>To take the best notes in class, you need a system. There are a lot of great <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/back-to-basics-perfect-your-note-taking-techniques-484879924\" target=\"_blank\">note-taking techniques</a> that can help you identify the key elements of any lesson and organize them in a way that will help you study—but one of the best ways to actually learn and retain what the notes say is by color-coding. It's easy and even kind of fun to work this technique into your existing study structure, so here's what to do.</p><h2 id=\"how-color-coding-your-notes-helps-you-study\">How color-coding your notes helps you study</h2><p>Using color can improve the performance of your memory. This isn’t just a throwaway observation: Research has backed it up. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6794354/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">One study from 2019</a> asserted that color, a perceptual stimulus, has “significant impact on improving human emotion and memory” and found “colored multimedia learning materials induced positive emotional experiences during learning and influenced the brain’s information processing.” Positive emotion increased motivation to learn there, but other studies have even more directly linked color to memory, skipping the emotional part altogether. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743993/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">this literature review from 2013</a> noted that “there appears to be a basis for associating color and its significant effect on memory abilities.”</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Other studies, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9674548/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">like this one from 2022</a>, have pointed to how vital the use of color is for students’ self-expression, too, finding it “a key to their being satisfied with the learning process and its success, as well as with their future career growth.” The study found that color-coding important text was most important for students, who could control their color-coding and enhance their own self-study process.</p><p>As with a lot of studying and learning techniques, we see this applied a lot in the early years of school, but it phases out as learners get older—though it shouldn't. Even though it was further back than high school, your memories of elementary school may be more vivid and you may even remember learning specific things. I remember a lot of educational art projects I did as a kid, for instance, especially when I got to choose the colors and designs I used. Applying that same mix of self-determination, active decision-making, and whimsy to more advanced studies can't hurt.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-color-code-your-notes\">How to color-code your notes</h2><p>As made clear in the research on the topic, color-coding is as much about self-driven study and expression as it is about memory and retention, which means there’s no right or wrong way to color-code your own notes.</p><p>You can use different colors of pen as you take the notes, for instance using red to write out key points and black to fill in supplemental information. This works well when you're using a critical reading framework, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/kwl-study-method\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a>, too. Say you're using KWL, where you split your page into three columns and label them <strong>Know</strong>, <strong>Want to know</strong>, and <strong>Learn</strong>. The \"learn\" column is where you write the answers to the questions you posit in \"want to know,\" so you could consider writing those in a different color so they really stick out. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Or, you could use highlighters to code certain kinds of info. For instance, yellow can signify key points, blue can indicate things you’re not sure about, green could be vocabulary words, and so forth. The key is to create a system that is uniform and can be used across all your notes so you start associating the different colors with certain ideas or concepts. </p><p>You can do this in class as you take notes so even from the start, you're actively identifying key concepts, vocab words, and the like, or you can do it while you revise and review your notes to help you organize them better. Color-coding is especially helpful in review, as you can quickly scan a page to identify, say, all the important dates in a history lesson—provided you took a few seconds to highlight them in a certain color beforehand.</p><p>In the front of each notebook, make a color-coded directory to remind yourself what each pen or highlighter hue represents, then stick to it. You can, of course, do this if you're typing your notes in a word processing document, too, but bear in mind that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">research suggests you'll remember hand-written materials</a> better. </p><p>Once you create a color-coding structure, stick to it in all areas of your studying. When <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">making flashcards</a>, make sure to keep your key points yellow, your vocab words green, or whatever makes sense with the structure you're using. The same goes if you're <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/these-are-my-favorite-mind-mapping-templates-for-studyi-1850843156\" target=\"_blank\">creating mind maps</a> (which you should be) to help you visualize your notes and course materials. Make your bubble or text colors align with the hues you've assigned to different elements of your content. To make that even easier, use an app. My <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">favorite for mind maps is Xmind</a>, which allows for plenty of color-picking options.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

/><p>Do you want to learn the material you’re studying—like, <em>really </em>learn it? I'm not talking about learning enough to pass a test, but rather, learning enough that you know it for life. Then what you need to do is <em>overlearn</em> it. One learning theory suggests that if you overlearn, you’ll attain automaticity, or the ability to do something without having to think about it, and ultimately retain more knowledge. Here’s what overlearning is and how to do it.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-overlearning\">What is overlearning?</h2><p>You know something is serious when the <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/overlearning\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">American Psychological Association has a definition for it</a>, and that’s the case here: Per the APA, overlearning is “practice that is continued beyond the point at which the individual knows or performs the task as well as can be expected.” The APA says the benefits here can include “increased persistence of the learning over time or better retention and memory.” The terminology makes sense; once you've learned something <em>over</em> the extent you need to, it becomes second nature. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Simply put, overlearning involves studying something even once you’re sure you know it, which is why this technique is overlooked and, if I'm being honest, a little annoying. It makes sense that once you get information down, you don't want to seemingly waste time going over it, but according to this theory, that is, unfortunately, when the magic happens. Don’t stop reviewing or studying just because you succeeded in memorizing something. Instead, keep going, digging it deeper and deeper into your brain.</p><p>Hermann Ebbinghaus, the researcher who brought us the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-beat-the-forgetting-curve-while-studyi-1850791645\" target=\"_blank\">Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</a>, studied memory in the 1890s, figuring out that as time passed, memories decreased. (That’s basically what the forgetting curve is all about and a pretty common-sense phenomenon you have certainly experienced in your own life.) According to him, overlearning happens when you keep repeating what you’re going over well past the point at which you can recall it with 100% accuracy. Think about a story you've told numerous times over your lifetime. If you hadn't started reciting it at parties and on first dates, the details may have gotten fuzzy, but since you did, it's practically a well-rehearsed performance at this point. </p><p>See, <em>recalling </em>it is something that takes effort. The goal of overlearning is to reach automaticity, <a href=\"https://cirl.etoncollege.com/dont-just-learn-emoverlearn-em/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">pulling the information from your longterm memory</a> with no effort and freeing up space in your working memory.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-overlearn\">How do you overlearn?</h2><p>The next time you’re studying, review material you already know front to back. For instance, when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">using the Leitner method</a> (which involves spaced repetition of flash cards, the frequency of review of each depending on how well you did the last time you quizzed yourself on it), always review all the flashcards you’re assigned on a particular day, even if you feel like skipping them because you got them right last time. Repeatedly going over material you know well is the key to overlearning and eventual automatic recall.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Flashcards, in general, are a great way to study and they're perfect for this, especially if you're following the Leitner technique. Just because a flashcard has been moved into the section you study less frequently doesn't mean you should never go back to it. In fact, if you're trying to overlearn, it's one of the only times I'd recommend not using Leitner—at least not right away. For the first few days of reviewing your cards, go through all of them and don't sort them by whether you get the answers right or wrong. Just keep drilling the same information over and over again.</p><p>Another useful tool here is the practice of blurting, which is what we call it when you write down or say everything you can remember about a topic. That <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">forces active recall</a>—or the act of consciously yanking information out of your long-term memory—and trains you to quickly identify key details in your brain. At the end of every week, do a round of blurting, even if you nailed all the details last time around.</p><p>Schedule blocks of time in your week for reviewing materials you’ve already mastered when you're <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">pre-planning your distributed practice</a>. This can be as easy as re-reading a chapter or your notes, or as complex as taking practice quizzes or using flashcards. Continually reintroducing familiar ideas to yourself will dig them deeper into your longterm memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

than AirPods. AirPods sync between all your Apple devices, sound great, and ship with features like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a> and even a heart rate monitor. The problem comes, however, if something happens to your buds—especially when your battery starts to lose its capacity to hold a charge. Unlike your iPhone, whose battery is easily replaceable, AirPods aren't simple to repair. As it happens, they might not be repairable at all.  </p><p>It seems that hasn't changed with Apple's latest earbuds, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/airpods-pro-3-are-more-forgiving-for-the-tine-eared\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 3</a>. iFixit put the newest AirPods Pro through a teardown test to see how repairable they might be. The result? A whopping zero out of 10: totally unrepairable. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"airpods-pro-3-cant-be-fixed\">AirPods Pro 3 can't be fixed</h2><p>There are a number of issues in the AirPods Pro 3's design that lead to iFixit's declaration here. Chief among them is that Apple chooses to seal the entire casing with strong glue. In order to open up the buds, you need to heat them to loosen that glue, then pry the buds open with sharp tools. You need to both avoid melting the plastic of the earbuds themselves, while also trying hard not to disfigure the case while slicing it open. It's a tough balancing act. </p><p>Once inside, however, the trouble only continues. The battery is also held down with strong glue, so, once again, you need to apply heat without melting the earbud itself. Even if you successfully remove the battery, it's extremely difficult to reassemble all of the elements here—or to, god forbid, attempt to <em>replace</em> one of those elements should they break. Apple has designed these earbuds to pack a ton of tech into a <em>tiny</em> package, with both glue and soldering, which means you run the risk of destroying crucial components when moving them around. It's all too easy to accidentally ruin the microphones or noise cancelling tech here.</p><p>The same goes for the stem of the buds, and even the AirPods Pro 3 case: Both are all glued up, and are too easy to destroy while attempting to open or fix a component. In fact, iFixit says these \"repairs\" are so difficult, many repair shops don't even bother. Between the need for special tools and the risk for failure, they simply forgo AirPods repair attempts.</p><p>This nothing new for AirPods. According to iFixit, all of Apple's previous Bluetooth earbuds have the same problem. As it happens, all AirPods models—save for the AirPods Max—have achieved a zero out of 10 on iFixit's scale. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"are-there-repairable-earbuds\">Are there repairable earbuds?</h2><p>While many other earbud brands score better on the repairability scale, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/wireless-earbud-repairability-scores\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">many also don't fare much<em> </em>better</a> than AirPods. Scroll through iFixit's list, and you'll find other scores ranging from zero to three out of 10. It seems a lot of companies follow Apple's lead here and solder their batteries and components together with glue. </p><p>Still, there are some winners here, according to iFixit. The undeniable champ comes are the Fairphone Fairbuds, which scored a perfect 10 out of 10. The batteries in the earbuds are easy to replace, the case is modular and easy to disassemble, and Fairphone offers replacement parts and instructions. Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live are the runner-up with an eight out of 10: They're similarly repairable to the Fairbuds, but they don't have official repair instructions or parts, other than the batteries for the earbuds. Sony's WF-1000XM4 scored a respectable seven out of 10, as they also have easy to replace batteries with a modular case—though they don't include official parts or instructions.  </p><p>If your primary goal when buying earbuds is repairability, you do have options out there. If you want the best possible experience when using your Apple devices, AirPods are still where it's at. Just know that when something fails, such as the battery or another component, your Apple earbuds are kind of toast. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-on-your-iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Notification Summaries</a>. With Apple Intelligence, your iPhone can truncate lengthy messages and alerts into succinct summaries that are meant to be read at a glance. The idea is, rather than sift through a sea of notifications, you can simply scan your missed alerts and get up to speed quickly. </p><p>In execution, however, it's been a bit of a disaster. While Apple's AI could offer accurate summaries, some of its outputs were quite inaccurate. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apples-latest-ios-beta-quietly-kills-ai-news-notifications\" target=\"_blank\">The most infamous example</a> was when Apple Intelligence incorrectly summarized a BBC news alert, saying that the suspected UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione had committed suicide in prison. Following that incident, Apple pulled Notification Summaries for news and entertainment alerts, until the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">release of iOS 26</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But even when summaries are accurate, they aren't always ideal. When Apple first released the feature, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-breakup-text\" target=\"_blank\">one user went viral</a> after sharing how Notification Summaries summed up two breakup texts from their partner: \"No longer in a relationship; wants belongings from apartment.\" In theory, it might be nice to see a summary of a long series of alerts; in practice, it might be better for you to read your messages yourself. </p><p>It is against this backdrop that this latest AI summary news comes to us: Samsung is currently working on its own version of Notification Summaries for Galaxy devices.  </p><h2 id=\"notification-summaries-on-one-ui-85\">Notification summaries on One UI 8.5</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-5-ai-notification-summaries-galaxy-devices/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by SamMobile</a>, Samsung is actively working on a new AI notification summary feature for Galaxy devices. The outlet unearthed the feature within Samsung's latest One UI 8.5 firmware update, which is now online for the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>SamMobile has this firmware running, but, at this time, the feature itself is not actually working. What <em>is</em> working, however, is a pop-up explaining how the feature works. When pulling down the notification panel on a Galaxy running One UI 8.5, you'll see the following message: \"Your longer conversations can now be summarized to give you quick recaps.\" </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can also find a new settings menu for \"Notification summaries\" that, while not currently active, explains the feature in more detail: \"Summarize long messages and group conversations to get quick recaps. Summaries use AI on your device, which may sometimes make mistakes. Your messages are never sent to Google.\" From here, you're now able to choose apps to exclude from these summaries, though, again, the summaries themselves are not live as of this article. </p><p>Still, it's an interesting first look at how Samsung plans to roll out AI notifications. As we can see from the current explainer, the feature will tap into an AI model to summarize alerts, which SamMobile guesses will most likely be <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/difference-between-google-gemini-apps-and-models\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini Nano</a>. Nano is Google's fast, lightweight model that's designed to run on-device. That tracks with what we can see here, as the feature claims no data is ever sent to Google when summarizing notifications.  </p><p>If you're going to use AI, on-device processing is certainly better than sending your data over the internet. Still, it'll be interesting to see how Samsung's version fares compared to Apple's. Will the former come up with a more reliable way to summarize alerts, or will it feel about the same as it does on iOS? For what it's worth, I had to turn off Notification Summaries on my iPhone. I just found it largely unhelpful, even when it was accurate. If I had a Galaxy, I wouldn't be shocked if I felt compelled to do the same. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

officially announced a number of smart home initiatives</a>. <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-nest-cams-home-speaker-walmart/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Alongside new devices</a>—including Nest cameras, doorbells, and a new Google Home Speaker—the company rolled out a <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/google-home-app-gemini-redesign/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">redesigned Google Home app</a>. As you might expect in 2025, Google's new smart home strategy is powered by the company's AI, Gemini, with a new branding to boot: <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/gemini-for-home-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Gemini for Home</a>. </p><p>The company is making a lot of claims for how its next-generation tech will improve your <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/series/a-guide-to-automating-your-entire-home\" target=\"_blank\">smart home</a>. We'll need to wait for the reviewers to put Gemini and the new Google Home app through their paces, not to mention all of Google's new devices, but until then, we can take a peek at the future Google is selling us on: </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"gemini-for-home\">Gemini for Home</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1128.v1759334369.webp\" alt=\"screenshots of gemini for home\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_800x451.v1759334369.webp 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_1400x790.v1759334369.webp 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1128.v1759334369.webp 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Google Assistant is nothing new, but even Google seems to think there's been room for improvement. The company says the experience was \"functional, not intuitive or natural,\" which seems to be informing Google's newest smart home assistant: Gemini for Home.</p><p>As you might expect, Gemini is replacing Google Assistant across all Google smart home products. The company's argument here is that the new experience is much more natural than before: Previously, you might have needed to ensure your commands were succinct and to the point for the assistant to understand them. Going forward, Google says you can take advantage of the AI's contextual awareness for more casual requests. </p><p>If you're asking for help fixing your dishwasher, for example, you don't need to preface each request with the problem at hand. You can begin with a question like \"Hey Google, my dishwasher is having trouble draining. Where should I start?\" If it suggests you check the filter, you don't need to say \"Hey Google, I'm trying to get my dishwasher to drain, but the filter seems fine. What's the next step?\" Instead, you can simply follow up with \"Hey Google, the filter seems fine. What's next?\" Google says Gemini will understand the context, and continue to help. </p><p>If you want to bypass the the constant \"Hey Googles,\" you can say \"Hey Google, let's chat.\" This kicks on Gemini Live, the AI's voice mode, which let's you have a back and forth with Gemini. </p><p>The company says you can do the same when asking questions about things like songs and movies. If you want to look up a song from a movie, but you don't remember the name of either, you can share vague details about the movie and Gemini supposedly can put the pieces together.    </p><p>Perhaps most importantly for the smart home itself, Google says Gemini can handle more complex requests. For example, you can ask it to turn off all lights except for a specific room, or trust that the AI will understand the context of the room you're asking about, e.g., \"Can you turn on the lights by the oven\" will mean turning on the lights in the kitchen. My favorite of Google's promised features, however, is that you can ask Gemini to add items to your grocery lists from recipes, rather than individual items. You can simply request a shopping list for Pad Thai, and, according to Google, Gemini will add all the ingredients necessary to your shopping list.</p><h2 id=\"gemini-with-smart-cameras\">Gemini with smart cameras</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334447.png\" alt=\"google smart cameras\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_800x434.v1759334447.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_1400x759.v1759334447.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334447.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Google says Gemini for Home can also upgrade smart cameras connected to Google Home. The company argues that most smart camera alerts are \"low context,\" pinging you with things like \"motion detected\" or \"person detected,\" but leaving the rest on you to figure out what's really going on. </p><p>With Gemini for Home, Google says it is using AI to make your smart camera experience more contextual. Alerts will offer a \"full narrative of what's happening,\" so you can learn from the notification itself whether you have a USPS delivery, or simply a shadow moving in front of the camera. Gemini will also  organize and summarize all of the day's video clips—you can choose whether to review all the videos taken, or simply scan the summary for any updates the AI thought important. Google says you can ask Gemini questions about your clips, as well. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Speaking of which, you can ask Gemini to find specific video clips using natural language. Google says you can ask questions like \"When did the kids get home,\" or \"Did I leave the car door open today?\"</p><h2 id=\"the-new-google-home-app\">The new Google Home app</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334506.png\" alt=\"google home app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_800x434.v1759334506.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_1400x759.v1759334506.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334506.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Tying all these updates together is the overhauled Google Home app, which reportedly has over 100 new features and performance improvements. Google says there were three goals in mind with this particular update: \"Make it faster, more reliable, and complete.\"</p><p>To that first point, the app should perform quite well, if the company is to be believed. Google claims its new Home app is over 70% faster on some Android devices than before, with crashes down by almost 80%, while smart camera live views supposedly load 30% faster with 40% fewer playback failures. </p><p>The new design comes with three main tabs: There's the Home tab, which is where you see all of the controls for your smart home devices. Within this tab, there are swipeable menus for things like Favorites and devices. Next, there's the Activity tab, which contains your home's activity history. You can see when a routine was started, when motion was detected on a camera, and when a light was turned off. Finally, there's the Automations tab: You can see which automations are coming up, access your entire automations collection, and create new automations as well.  </p><p>Google has also integrated \"the best\" of the Nest app into the new Home app. While the dedicated Nest app is still available, Google clearly intends for Nest functionality to live here long-term. That includes support for Nest Thermostats from 2015 on, as well as Nest Protect smoke and CO emergency alerts and Nest x Yale Lock passcode management. Google says the experience of controlling previous Nest devices is also enhanced in the new app, with higher frame rates and faster loading times.</p><p>Finally, there's \"Ask Home,\" a new Gemini-powered feature that aims to make it easy to find any element of your smart home. For example, Google says you can type things like \"lights\" or \"living room\" to find deices and automations related to those queries. You can look up clips from your smart cameras, stack multiple smart home commands together, or create an automation with natural language.  </p><p>Google says all of these changes are rolling out today, Wednesday, Oct. 1 around the globe. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

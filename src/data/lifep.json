The thing is, it actually matters quite a bit, especially if you care about charging speeds. But even knowing that, you might take a look at <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zJrY5p?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20newest%20power%20adapter&short_url=zJrY5p&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fapples-newest-iphone-charger-is-pretty-versatile&event_label=Apple%27s%20newest%20power%20adapter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Apple's newest power adapter</a> and think \"$40? Without a <em>cable</em>? No way.\" </p><p>It's certainly a steep price for a power adapter, especially as you can find other options for <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aeKLgw?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=literally%20half%20the%20price&short_url=aeKLgw&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fapples-newest-iphone-charger-is-pretty-versatile&event_label=literally%20half%20the%20price\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">literally half the price</a>. But there's something interesting about this particular charger. It might not necessarily be <em>worth</em> $40, but there's a reason it's not cheap: This thing might be the only power adapter you need in your tech tool box.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"dynamic-power-output\">Dynamic power output</h2><p>As you can see from the product listing, Apple's power adapter is advertised as a 40W charger. However, it is <em>also</em> advertised as being able to deliver up to 60W. You don't typically see that from a power adapter, as the wattage you see is the wattage you usually get. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/heres-what-makes-apples-new-40-watt-power-adapter-unique/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As CNET's Bridget Carey explains</a>, this is made possible through some clever engineering. The power adapter will start by offering the maximum charging output your device in question can take in, up to 60W. iPhones can't accept 60W of charging, for example, but MacBooks can: So this 40W power adapter can actually deliver 60W of power when connected to something like your MacBook—at first. Since the power adapter isn't actually a true 60W charger, it can't sustain that power output for long periods of time. As such, it pulls back the power draw over time. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>In practical terms, it means you can get an initial 60W charge on a device that can accept it, which can help charge your larger devices faster at the start. Rather than bring a power adapter for your iPhone, and a larger one for your MacBook, or tote a huge power adapter for both, you get a compact power adapter that can offer the best of both worlds.</p><p>There's also a reason Apple chose 40W for this power adapter's \"standard\" output. The new iPhone 17 series <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-i-will-probably-upgrade-to-base-iphone-17\" target=\"_blank\">has the quickest charging speeds of any iPhone device so far</a>, charging up to 50% in just 20 minutes. (The exception is the iPhone 17 Air, which can charge to 50% in 30 minutes.) However, you need the right power adapter to take advantage of these charging speeds—at least 40W. (Again, the iPhone 17 Air is the exception, as it can charge to 50% in 30 minutes with 20W or higher.)</p><p>That's really the perk of this dynamic power adapter. It's powerful enough to offer the fastest charging speeds for your iPhone 17, while also offering a power boost to give something like a MacBook a faster charge, at least for a little while.

No matter what power adapter you end up going with, just keep two things in mind: the maximum power output of the adapter itself, but also your charging cable.

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Cleaning is one of those necessary chores that most of us don't have much enthusiasm for. It's often demanding and tedious work, and while you're taking care of it, you do so with the knowledge that you're going to have to do it all again next week.</p><p>There's some good news, though, for the cleaning-averse: Modern day tech can handle a lot of these jobs on your behalf, as smart cleaning gadgets continue to get better and better. In recent years, they've become more reliable and more effective, and you've got a host of different models to choose from.</p><p>This introduction to smart cleaning technology will bring you up to date on the products that are available, and what they can do for you. Yes, you can have a home that's neater and cleaner—with just a few button presses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pros-and-cons-of-cleaning-tech\">The pros and cons of cleaning tech</h2><p>The big positive from investing in smart cleaning gadgets is, of course, that you won't have to do these jobs yourself, so the hours you save can be put towards doing something you actually enjoy.</p><p>These gadgets don't get tired, sick, or irritable, and will work at any time of the day or night—though you don't necessarily want a robot vacuum humming away at 4 a.m.. In many cases they can be operated remotely and work autonomously, so they can be taking care of the chores while you're out at work or on vacation.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Ecovacs Winbot W2 Pro Omni\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can get smart devices to wash your windows for you.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Ecovacs</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You <em>are </em>going to have to make an initial investment in the technology, and, for some devices, a rather sizable one. The argument can be made that hiring someone to do your cleaning is a better option than getting robots to do it: They might do a more thorough job, depending on the person and the gadget you're comparing them to, and you can give them more specific instructions. However, getting cleaners in does involve giving someone else access to your home, and finding a mutually convenient time. It will also be an ongoing expense.</p><p>There are a few more cons to consider. One is that a certain amount of tidying up and preparation work is often required before the robots can take over. You may have to pick up toys and clothes, for example, so the robot vacuum can vacuum. By the time you've done that, you might think it makes more sense to just do the whole job yourself.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roomba app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Many smart devices can be controlled via an app.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: iRobot</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>What's more, these gadgets require a certain level of maintenance: Depending on the device, you need to empty them out, supply them with power, water, and cleaning products, and perhaps even clean parts of them yourself. Like any piece of hardware, they will experience wear and tear, and will eventually need to be replaced.</p><p>There's one other consideration to think about, which is that manual cleaning is a great way to exercise. <a href=\"https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-023-04039-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Studies have shown</a> that domestic duties can give you enough of a workout to extend your lifespan and improve a host of different health markers, so you might want to use some of the time that these gadgets are saving you to head out for a run or for a session at the gym.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-cleaning-gadgets-you-can-buy\">The best smart cleaning gadgets you can buy</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to transform your home into one that cleans itself, you can automate a number of different processes using a number of different devices. There's plenty of choice out there, so the usual rules apply: Take your time to research the various options and the features they're offering versus their price, and find as many reviews as you can from people who've used them.</p><h3>Robot vacuums and mops</h3><p>This is the obvious place to start, as these are the gadgets that usually come to mind when you think of smart cleaning tech. You can find single-purpose devices that only vacuum or only mop, or devices that combine both functions.</p><p>While early models had their issues with reliability and cleaning power, the robot vacuums you can buy today are generally more impressive in terms of how clean they can get your carpets and floors. You'll find features like LiDAR and camera-powered mapping and obstacle avoidance, self-emptying capabilities, and auto-adjustments depending on what surface is being cleaned. </p><p>Often, everything these machines do can be organized through a companion app, so you can set the cleaners to work on a specific schedule, as well as set zones or rooms that are off limits. We're even starting to see robot vacuums that can <a href=\"https://vacuumwars.com/eufy-marswalker-omni-s2-ifa-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">climb up the stairs</a>, so they really can get your whole house vacuumed and mopped without an assist.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roborock Saros 10R\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>The Roborock Saros 10R comes with its own docking station.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Roborock</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>These cleaners can be a significant investment.

These pieces of hardware elevate clothes cleaning with a variety of useful and intelligent tricks, including the ability to adjust cleaning and drying cycles to the type and size of load, remote control via mobile apps, and a number of self-maintaining mechanisms.</p><p>A good example is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMkVn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20WM6700HBA&short_url=9YMkVn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=LG%20WM6700HBA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">LG WM6700HBA</a>, which will set you back $1,250. There's on-board AI assistance to work out the best cycles for the clothes you're washing, an automatic dispenser for just the right amount of detergent and fabric softener to cut down on waste, and remote operations and monitoring via the LG ThinQ app.</p><h3>Smart dishwashers</h3><p>Finally we have <strong>smart dishwashers</strong>, which use automated technology to give your crockery and cutlery a better clean than standard appliances might. The features are similar to those you'll find on smart washers and dryers: Sensing technology for understanding what's been loaded in and adjusting the cleaning accordingly, remote app control and smart home integration, and as much automated maintenance and self-cleaning as possible.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PJqd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bosch%20500%20Series&short_url=98PJqd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=Bosch%20500%20Series\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bosch 500 Series</a>, which is priced at $1,250 at the time of writing. It has intelligent sensors to check cleaning progress, an AutoAir feature that automatically pops the dishwasher door open when cleaning is finished to let air circulate, and the option of operating cleaning cycles and other dishwasher features from an app on your phone.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HHFDBG3H1VSXE5XSDZ06W91C/image.fill.size_150x150.v1706808034.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of David Nield\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>David Nield</p>\n                                <div>\n                                            <p>David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. </p>\n                                    </div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/david-nield\">Read David's full bio</a>\n                            </p></div>\n        </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by David</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-smart-tech-cool-heat-home\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K59Q1VPXAQSK010BFW6ASQZT/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759157072.jpg\" alt=\"person using smart thermostat\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-watch-pornhub-even-if-its-blocked-in-your-state\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1749051765.jpg\" alt=\"Pornhub goes dark\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>",

/><p>Do you want to learn the material you’re studying—like, <em>really </em>learn it? I'm not talking about learning enough to pass a test, but rather, learning enough that you know it for life. Then what you need to do is <em>overlearn</em> it. One learning theory suggests that if you overlearn, you’ll attain automaticity, or the ability to do something without having to think about it, and ultimately retain more knowledge. Here’s what overlearning is and how to do it.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-overlearning\">What is overlearning?</h2><p>You know something is serious when the <a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/overlearning\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">American Psychological Association has a definition for it</a>, and that’s the case here: Per the APA, overlearning is “practice that is continued beyond the point at which the individual knows or performs the task as well as can be expected.” The APA says the benefits here can include “increased persistence of the learning over time or better retention and memory.” The terminology makes sense; once you've learned something <em>over</em> the extent you need to, it becomes second nature. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Simply put, overlearning involves studying something even once you’re sure you know it, which is why this technique is overlooked and, if I'm being honest, a little annoying. It makes sense that once you get information down, you don't want to seemingly waste time going over it, but according to this theory, that is, unfortunately, when the magic happens. Don’t stop reviewing or studying just because you succeeded in memorizing something. Instead, keep going, digging it deeper and deeper into your brain.</p><p>Hermann Ebbinghaus, the researcher who brought us the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-beat-the-forgetting-curve-while-studyi-1850791645\" target=\"_blank\">Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</a>, studied memory in the 1890s, figuring out that as time passed, memories decreased. (That’s basically what the forgetting curve is all about and a pretty common-sense phenomenon you have certainly experienced in your own life.) According to him, overlearning happens when you keep repeating what you’re going over well past the point at which you can recall it with 100% accuracy. Think about a story you've told numerous times over your lifetime. If you hadn't started reciting it at parties and on first dates, the details may have gotten fuzzy, but since you did, it's practically a well-rehearsed performance at this point. </p><p>See, <em>recalling </em>it is something that takes effort. The goal of overlearning is to reach automaticity, <a href=\"https://cirl.etoncollege.com/dont-just-learn-emoverlearn-em/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">pulling the information from your longterm memory</a> with no effort and freeing up space in your working memory.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-overlearn\">How do you overlearn?</h2><p>The next time you’re studying, review material you already know front to back. For instance, when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">using the Leitner method</a> (which involves spaced repetition of flash cards, the frequency of review of each depending on how well you did the last time you quizzed yourself on it), always review all the flashcards you’re assigned on a particular day, even if you feel like skipping them because you got them right last time. Repeatedly going over material you know well is the key to overlearning and eventual automatic recall.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Flashcards, in general, are a great way to study and they're perfect for this, especially if you're following the Leitner technique. Just because a flashcard has been moved into the section you study less frequently doesn't mean you should never go back to it. In fact, if you're trying to overlearn, it's one of the only times I'd recommend not using Leitner—at least not right away. For the first few days of reviewing your cards, go through all of them and don't sort them by whether you get the answers right or wrong. Just keep drilling the same information over and over again.</p><p>Another useful tool here is the practice of blurting, which is what we call it when you write down or say everything you can remember about a topic. That <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">forces active recall</a>—or the act of consciously yanking information out of your long-term memory—and trains you to quickly identify key details in your brain. At the end of every week, do a round of blurting, even if you nailed all the details last time around.</p><p>Schedule blocks of time in your week for reviewing materials you’ve already mastered when you're <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">pre-planning your distributed practice</a>. This can be as easy as re-reading a chapter or your notes, or as complex as taking practice quizzes or using flashcards. Continually reintroducing familiar ideas to yourself will dig them deeper into your longterm memory. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

It's a signifier of my progression through Club Peloton, a new member recognition program that comes with some solid rewards.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-club-peloton\">What is Club Peloton?</h2><p>Club Peloton is a new ranking system that's meant to reflect a person's efforts and participation with Peloton workouts. Progress is applied retroactively (good news for my 201-day streak) which means I've achieved the rank of Silver III. The ranks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Silver (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Gold (I, II, and III)</p></li><li><p>Champion</p></li><li><p>Legend</p></li></ul><p>Within each of the first three ranks, there are three tiers, and Champion and Legend each stand alone, so there are 11 levels to work through overall. </p><p>Importantly, you can never be demoted on Club Peloton; you can only move up. If you miss a week's worth of workouts while you're in Bronze III, you won't log in to find that you've been bumped down to Bronze II. It's meant to encourage you, not shame you. </p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-earn-points\">How do you earn points?</h2><p>The purpose of this new ranking system is to encourage members, make people try new things, and give recognition and rewards to participants. The methods of earning points demonstrate that. Here's what you can do to rise the ranks:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Earn two points for each day you work out with Peloton, whether using the company's equipment, its app, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strength+.</a></p></li><li><p>Earn points corresponding to your weekly streaks, so three points for a three-week streak, etc. If you work out two weeks in a row, you'll get two points. If you work out 40 weeks in a row, that week is going to end with a 40-point boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for yearly streaks, too. If you work out 52 weeks in a row, you end up with a year-long streak, which earns you double points. Instead of 52 points at the end of that year, you get 104. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for milestones. Milestones can be found on your Peloton profile and include things like taking 10 or 25 of a certain kind of class. When you achieve a milestone in a second activity beyond one you've already got one in, you get a 10% boost. Milestones in three or more give you a 20% boost. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for participating in programs. Every week you are actively involved in one, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton's FTP program</a>, you get two points. You get one point for every class you complete in your new, AI-generated personal plan and 10 points any time you undertake a Peloton challenge. </p></li><li><p>Earn points for being a team player. Every week, you can earn up to one point each for giving someone a virtual high five during class, taking a live class, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a Team</a>. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-are-the-ranks-calculated\">How are the ranks calculated?</h2><p>Want to know how many points are required to raise your rank? Here's the breakdown:</p><ul><li><p>Bronze is your level if you have zero to 99 points.</p></li><li><p>Silver is for 100 to 1,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Gold covers 2,000 points to 14,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Champion is 15,000 to 29,999 points.</p></li><li><p>Legend is for anyone with over 30,000 points.</p></li></ul><p>Like I said, I'm on a daily streak that stretches almost two-thirds of a year and I'm only in Silver III with just 1,205 points and 795 to go until I hit Gold I. You can tap into your point history to see a breakdown of how you got to where you are. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-all-this\">What is the point of all this?</h2><p>To me, this is awesome, but I am a well-known lover of all manner of streak-based app gimmicks. I will do anything for the pleasure of a digital badge, like go to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">Dunkin' Donuts every day</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/finch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">keep track of my to-do list</a> on an app that forces me to report my progress to a little cartoon bird. Simply put, I find it motivating to compete for something, even if I'm just competing with myself to earn what amounts to little more than pixels. </p><p>Club Peloton, however, amounts to more than that: The company promises that as you work through ranks, you'll unlock \"surprises.\" Future surprises notwithstanding, some of the rewards are already known. You can get early access to new classes or challenges, discounts on apparel or other retail goods, instructor shoutouts during class, and invitations to exclusive in-person events. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

There are now three levels of membership to go along with the two current hardware devices. I'll explain what they are, and how to decide which one makes the most sense for you. </p><p>Whoop is the screenless fitness tracker that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-40-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>earned four stars in my review of the 4.0 model</u></a> for its integrated fitness and recovery tracking and its handling of strength training. It’s only available by subscription, with the hardware being sort of a bonus that comes with membership. (That said, if you're interested in a screenless wristband that doesn't have the subscription-worthy software, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/amazfit-helio-strap-review\" target=\"_blank\">Amazfit Helio strap</a> is a strong alternative. I have a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/amazfit-helio-strap-vs-whoop\" target=\"_blank\">comparison of the two here</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-in-the-whoop-50-versus-the-mg\">What’s in the Whoop 5.0 versus the MG</h2><p>Whoop's 5.0 device is the current one that comes along with the budget and middle-of-the-road memberships. If you remember the older Whoop 4.0, it's very similar (but a smidge smaller and has more than double the battery life). The 5.0 is the device you get with One ($199/year) and Peak ($239/year) memberships.</p><p>The MG is the \"medical grade\" version of the hardware. It's the same size and shape as the 5.0, with the same sensors, except that it has a metal clasp so it can take ECG readings. (When you take ECG readings, you touch the clasp with one hand while wearing the device on your other wrist, much like the Apple Watch and other ECG-capable wearables.) The MG comes with the $359/year Life membership.</p><p>Both devices charge with a wireless power pack; you charge the power pack over USB-C at your convenience, and then when you want to top up your Whoop's battery, you slide the pack onto the Whoop as you're wearing it. Only members of the Peak and Life tiers get the wireless power pack; the lowest tier membership comes with a wired charger. </p><h2 id=\"what-you-get-with-each-of-the-three-membership-tiers\">What you get with each of the three membership tiers</h2><p>The three new membership tiers are One ($199/year), Peak ($239/year), and Life ($359/year). One is a stripped-down membership, Peak is similar to what Whoop users have right now, and Life is a new offering with extra health features. Here’s the breakdown: </p><h3>Whoop One ($199/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWEREn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=One&short_url=QWEREn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=One\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>One</u></a> is the budget membership. You get a wired charger instead of the wireless power pack, and a “CoreKnit” band, which seems to be a new material that isn’t as nice as the SuperKnit bands offered with the higher tiers.</p><p>If you downgrade to this level, you’ll lose a few features that Whoop members currently all get: the Health Monitor (with its readings of HRV, respiratory rate, resting heart rate, and skin temperature) and the Stress Monitor, which tells you in real time how much stress you seem to be under.</p><h3>Whoop Peak ($239/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9l30vP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Peak&short_url=9l30vP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=Peak\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Peak</a> is the most similar to the single subscription level that was offered with the 4.0, both in price and features. If your subscription renews without you choosing a tier, you’ll end up on Peak. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You’ll also get the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoops-healthspan-feature-expanding-support\" target=\"_blank\">Healthspan feature</a> that tells you your “Whoop age” and your “pace of aging,” and gives recommendations to improve those metrics. </p><h3>Whoop Life ($359/year)</h3><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDgONb?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Life&short_url=aDgONb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhoop-launches-its-50-and-mg-hardware-and-adds-pricing-tiers&event_label=Life\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Life</u></a> is the top tier membership, and comes with the MG rather than 5.0 hardware. It includes everything in Peak, including the Healthspan feature. </p><p>With the MG you can take ECG readings, and this tier also has a feature that claims to estimate your blood pressure. You’ll need to calibrate it with readings from a blood pressure cuff to start using it. This is controversial, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fda-says-whoops-blood-pressure-feature-is-illegal\" target=\"_blank\">the FDA has told Whoop the feature is illegal</a>, but it remains available in the app for now.</p><h2 id=\"what-if-i-have-an-older-device\">What if I have an older device? </h2><p>Whoop memberships still work with the old 4.0 device, and members with a 4.0 still get access to everything the Peak membership offers, including the Healthspan feature. If your membership renews without you choosing a tier, you’ll be rolled into the Peak membership. </p><p>If you don't already own a Whoop device, don't bother getting a 4.0. Sometimes people will try to sell or give away used versions as if they're doing you a favor by giving you a discount. There's nothing wrong with using a 4.0 if you'd like to keep another device out of the landfill, but it won't save you any money personally. To use a Whoop device is to pay Whoop for a membership, and you get a 5.0 (or MG) device free when you start or renew a membership. </p>\n            </article>",

was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-on-your-iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Notification Summaries</a>. With Apple Intelligence, your iPhone can truncate lengthy messages and alerts into succinct summaries that are meant to be read at a glance. The idea is, rather than sift through a sea of notifications, you can simply scan your missed alerts and get up to speed quickly. </p><p>In execution, however, it's been a bit of a disaster. While Apple's AI could offer accurate summaries, some of its outputs were quite inaccurate. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apples-latest-ios-beta-quietly-kills-ai-news-notifications\" target=\"_blank\">The most infamous example</a> was when Apple Intelligence incorrectly summarized a BBC news alert, saying that the suspected UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione had committed suicide in prison. Following that incident, Apple pulled Notification Summaries for news and entertainment alerts, until the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">release of iOS 26</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But even when summaries are accurate, they aren't always ideal. When Apple first released the feature, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-breakup-text\" target=\"_blank\">one user went viral</a> after sharing how Notification Summaries summed up two breakup texts from their partner: \"No longer in a relationship; wants belongings from apartment.\" In theory, it might be nice to see a summary of a long series of alerts; in practice, it might be better for you to read your messages yourself. </p><p>It is against this backdrop that this latest AI summary news comes to us: Samsung is currently working on its own version of Notification Summaries for Galaxy devices.  </p><h2 id=\"notification-summaries-on-one-ui-85\">Notification summaries on One UI 8.5</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-5-ai-notification-summaries-galaxy-devices/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by SamMobile</a>, Samsung is actively working on a new AI notification summary feature for Galaxy devices. The outlet unearthed the feature within Samsung's latest One UI 8.5 firmware update, which is now online for the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>SamMobile has this firmware running, but, at this time, the feature itself is not actually working. What <em>is</em> working, however, is a pop-up explaining how the feature works. When pulling down the notification panel on a Galaxy running One UI 8.5, you'll see the following message: \"Your longer conversations can now be summarized to give you quick recaps.\" </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can also find a new settings menu for \"Notification summaries\" that, while not currently active, explains the feature in more detail: \"Summarize long messages and group conversations to get quick recaps. Summaries use AI on your device, which may sometimes make mistakes. Your messages are never sent to Google.\" From here, you're now able to choose apps to exclude from these summaries, though, again, the summaries themselves are not live as of this article. </p><p>Still, it's an interesting first look at how Samsung plans to roll out AI notifications. As we can see from the current explainer, the feature will tap into an AI model to summarize alerts, which SamMobile guesses will most likely be <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/difference-between-google-gemini-apps-and-models\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini Nano</a>. Nano is Google's fast, lightweight model that's designed to run on-device. That tracks with what we can see here, as the feature claims no data is ever sent to Google when summarizing notifications.  </p><p>If you're going to use AI, on-device processing is certainly better than sending your data over the internet. Still, it'll be interesting to see how Samsung's version fares compared to Apple's. Will the former come up with a more reliable way to summarize alerts, or will it feel about the same as it does on iOS? For what it's worth, I had to turn off Notification Summaries on my iPhone. I just found it largely unhelpful, even when it was accurate. If I had a Galaxy, I wouldn't be shocked if I felt compelled to do the same. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

Back in April, the company <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">began testing end-to-end encrypted email messaging</a> for enterprise users. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/send-gmail-end-to-end-encrypted-emails-in-gmail.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">it officially rolled out the feature</a>. If you have a Google Workspace through work, you should now be able to send emails protected by E2EE, even if you're sending the email outside of Gmail. That should make it possible to send emails that only you, the recipient, and the IT department that manages your account can access. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/texts-may-not-be-secure-says-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">E2EE is essential</a> for anyone who wants to ensure that their communications are totally private. To simplify a complex technology, encrypting something like an email essentially means scrambling all of the code into something completely unrecognizable. In order to unscramble it, you need a \"key.\" In the case of Gmail's E2EE, you have a key, the recipient has a key, and whoever manages your Google Workspace account has a key. The keys to decrypt these emails aren't saved on Google's servers, so even Google should have no way to access your encrypted emails. You can send things like sensitive company information or medical information protected by HIPAA without worrying about prying eyes intercepting the message.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The only bummer here is that E2EE in Gmail is restricted to business accounts at this time. That said, there is a way to send more secure messages over a standard Gmail account—just don't expect E2EE-level protections.</p><h2 id=\"e2ee-for-enterprise-gmail-users\">E2EE for enterprise Gmail users</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg\" alt=\"google e2ee messaging\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759517385.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1759517385.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6NMBHY6GXXB4QMX9A29S8GY/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759517385.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>In order to send E2EE emails through your enterprise Gmail account, you need to ensure your Workspace admin turns it on. Once they do, you'll need to tell Gmail you want to send your email with E2EE. To do so, open Gmail, and choose \"Compose\" to start a new email. Choose \"Message security,\" then, under \"Additional encryption,\" choose \"Turn on.\" From here, you can compose your message as you normally would, adding your recipients to the list. </p><p>If your recipient is another Google Workspace user, the message will automatically be decrypted when it reaches their inbox. If they aren't a Gmail user, they won't be able to decrypt the email in their client. Instead, they'll receive a link that opens a \"restricted\" version of Gmail. Once they sign in, the message will decrypt, and they'll be able to read and respond to it from this restricted window. Note that IT departments can choose to have all E2EE messages open in restricted Gmail windows, even if the recipients are Google Workspace users.</p><h2 id=\"use-confidential-mode-to-send-secure-messages-for-free\">Use confidential mode to send \"secure\" messages for free</h2><p>If you don't have an enterprise account, there really isn't any way to send E2EE emails through Gmail. For that, you'd need a dedicated encrypted email service, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/proton-unlimited-review-worth-it-vpn-password-manager-secure-email\" target=\"_blank\">like Proton</a>. However, you can add an extra layer of security to your messages before you send them out. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>To do so, start a new email in Gmail, then choose \"Confidential mode\" from the options. This mode blocks recipients from forwarding, copying, printing, or downloading the email. You can also choose to have the message expire after a set period of time—including one day, one week, one month, three months, or five years—as well as password protect the email. If you choose the latter, Gmail will automatically generate a password and send it to the recipients via SMS. </p><p>These added protections are certainly helpful when sending sensitive information over Gmail, but they're imperfect. Again, this is not end-to-end encryption, which means it's possible to intercept and read messages sent this way. More practically, there's nothing stopping users from taking photos of the message with another device—though the same could be said with E2EE messages.</p><p>Unless you have an enterprise account, I'd avoid sending anything too important via Gmail at this time. You're better off using a dedicated E2EE platform, like Signal, WhatsApp, or iMessage.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

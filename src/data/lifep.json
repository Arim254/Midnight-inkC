That means when it comes to tasks that don't quite require that level of involvement, your productivity method can actually manage to stress you out. If you're tired of your to-do list feeling like such a heavy lift, you can  make simplifying things, well, simpler by prioritizing your tasks with the \"must, should, want\" technique. What is the “must, should, want” technique  This technique was developed by Jay Shirley about a decade ago. The blogger set out to enhance not only people’s productivity, but their daily enjoyability, too, This is important, as if you're miserable and unmotivated, you're not going to be especially productive. With this system, instead of prioritizing tasks only based on productivity or results, you also incorporate some of what you want to do, which helps round out your day without grinding you down.Similar to systems like Agile Results, “must, should, want” requires you to spend a little time every morning planning out your day. Setting aside a few dedicated minutes to figuring out the day’s plan is a good way to get in the zone and stay on track, but you have to remember to write down your goals to stay motivated and organized. In your planner (or in an app like Notion, if you want), create three columns: must, should, and want. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nUnder “Must,” write down what you must do on a given day, whether it’s a smaller piece of a larger, long-term project or an item that is due in a few hours. (If you need help figuring out those pieces and when they need to be done on time to best serve your larger goals, try incorporating the kanban method.) “Should” tasks are those you ought to do for the future, but aren’t down to the wire on yet—or those that won’t be earth-shattering if you don’t get them done right away. Finally, “want” tasks are those that you’d simply like to do, whether they have to do with your immediate responsibilities or not. \"Want\" is where this method differs from all others—plenty of methods out there ask you to prioritize your to-dos by level of \"must\" or \"should\" level urgency, but only this one leaves room for enjoyment.You complete each list in order. Getting through the things you must and should do leaves room for the things you want to do, and that pending reward can motivate you through the more rigid stuff.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhen and how to use the “must, should, want” methodThis works well for an overall day plan, incorporating work and responsibilities with after-hours hobbies. But it’s also helpful for specific projects, as it changes every morning. Today’s “should” tasks might be tomorrow’s “must” tasks, so there’s room for variability and a more fluid approach, as long as you stick with the habit of redoing your lists every morning. Getting a \"should\" done early can be motivating, but even identifying what is a \"must\" and what is a \"should\" can alleviate some of your stress and keep you engaged.It’s also helpful for budgeting. Before you get paid or go shopping, make a list of what you must buy, what you should buy, and what you want to buy. Even seeing it written out like that will help you make better purchasing decisions.To keep it all doable and manageable, challenge yourself to only put three to four things in every list on a given day. You’ll never get to the “want” column if you have nine “must” activities and seven “should” tasks, which defeats the point of the technique. Be discerning and if something isn’t a “must,” don’t pressure yourself; just make it a “should.” This approach is designed to inject some fun and reduce the stress from your typical to-do list, but it won’t work if you treat every task like an end-of-the-world necessity. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

The popularity of Pomodoro has also inspired offshoots that iterate on its philosophies, and one of them might hold particular appeal if you like to relax after completing a task by watching TV. It's called \"animedoro,\" and if the name reminds you of Japanese cartoons, there's a reason for that.What is the animedoro productivity method?Animedoro was created by a med student named Josh Chen, who four years ago uploaded a video explaining how, over the course of four months, he was able to study for 600 hours and still watch 300 hours of anime. In simple terms, his technique is a variation on the Pomodoro method, which involves working for 25 minutes, breaking for five minutes, and working for another 25 minutes, and so on. The original Pomodoro schedule provides a longer break after the fourth work session—but following animedoro, you’ll switch things up a bit. Using Chen’s model, you’ll work for 40 to 60 minutes at a time, then give yourself a 20-minute break to watch an episode of a TV show (or whatever else you want to do to reset). \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIn this way, animedoro is similar to flowtime, which is a technique where you spend time determining exactly what work-to-break ratio works for you. While Pomodoro is widely seen as the best option, since you get small breaks and a solid amount of time to focus and work, no method is one-size-fits-all. It may be that to achieve a state of deep work, you need to put in more than 25 minutes of effort. It may also be the case that five minutes of downtime to scroll your phone or refill your drink just isn’t enough to motivate you. Animedoro is a good option in either case, since it gives you longer periods to study or grind, plus more involved break periods. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut like I said, this method was conceptualized by a regular student, someone no different than you or me. Pomodoro, too, was founded by a student named Francisco Cirillo. You, like Chen and Cirillo, can mess with the timing of your work sessions and breaks until you find exactly what works for you. I recommend using a productivity timer app, like FocusPomo, because you can set different lengths of work sessions. If the times suggested here aren't working for you, do your own thing. Scheduling and committing to your work and your breaks is valuable, so don't give up if 25 on and five off aren't cutting it. How to try out the animedoro methodAs with the traditional Pomodoro technique, the real key to success is making effective use of your work periods. Knowing you have 20 minutes with your favorite show on the horizon can be a nice motivator, provided you can stick to the plan of working without distractions for the 40 or 60 minutes of focus time. Put your phone aside, don’t check any other tasks or notifications, and immerse yourself fully in the one thing you need to do. (This is where an app like FocusPomo shines, as it will block you from using other apps as soon as you start a focus session.) This isn’t a time for multitasking: Pick one activity and singularly focus on it for the entire work period. After an episode of Blue Eye Samurai, you can select a different task in your next 40- to 60-minute chunk.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Apple's distinct new design language has been met with praise and criticism, with some users enjoying the refreshed look, and others bemoaning the UI's issues with visibility and consistency.  It seems Apple was similarly of two minds on the update, having toyed around with the exact look of Liquid Glass throughout the iOS 26 beta testing period. The company seemed to be having trouble settling on a specific balance between the design's glassy effect, which can look really cool, and its overall readability. If buttons are too clear, for example, they'll let in more of the background elements, which can make it more difficult to see them. But by reducing the glass effect too much by adding a tint to the icon and menu backgrounds, Apple risks loses the charm of the design entirely. (Some critics have dubbed it \"Frosted Glass\" by comparison.)While Apple is seemingly still continuing to tweak Liquid Glass, it appears the company has decided that part of the problem is down to user preference. So rather than stick with one look for the design, Apple now lets you choose whether Liquid Glass looks more clear, or more tinted.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nTo be clear, or not to be clearThis new setting came as a bit of a surprise. Apple did not roll it out until the fourth beta for iOS 26.1 and macOS 26.1, only two weeks before the updates' official release. The toggle, which you can find in Settings > Display and Brightness (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings > Appearance on the Mac (macOS), gives users a simple choice in how Liquid Glass looks across their particular system: \"Clear,\" which is more transparent, and is in-line with Liquid Glass' original intent; or \"Tinted,\" which increases the opacity of menus and windows. You'll likely be able to read these elements better, but you won't see as much of the background shining through. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \"Clear\" (left) vs. \"Tinted\" (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGiving users what they asked for (sort of)During the pre-release beta testing period, some users called on Apple to add a Liquid Glass \"slider\" to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The idea was to allow users to fine-tune how Liquid Glass looks. Apple seems to have taken a different approach, offering only two levels of transparency with the new control. While a slider (or more transparency options, at least) would be great, what we're getting is better than nothing for users who prefer a more opaque Liquid Glass appearance.Before Apple added this dedicated settings page, there was a workaround you can use to \"undo\" Liquid Glass: By kicking on the \"Reduce Transparency\" feature in Accessibility settings, you could achieve a similar look to choosing the new \"Tinted\" option. I think you'll find that \"Tinted\" will achieve a more visually pleasing look, however, as it is something Apple deliberately implemented to work with the design of Liquid Glass, while reduce Transparency is simply a blanket effect that turns down transparency effects across iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

When you don’t get all your tasks done, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and disappointed in yourself, which doesn’t help you push through to finish those tasks, let alone feel like you’re thriving.You should be happy. You need to be productive. Reaching a state of zen can help you accomplish both—or so goes the theory behind the “Zen to Done” method, which aims to help you get more good and feel good about it. Unlike some other productivity approaches, this one has less to do with strict deadlines and weedy details than it does with pushing through and feeling good about a job well done. This makes it well suited to those who don't exactly blossom under pressure.What is Zen to Done?Zen to Done is a productivity system conceptualized by Zen Habits’ Leo Babauta. It’s structured around building simple habits that enable you to get your work done and feel good at the same time. Other methods, like the once ubiquitous “Getting Things Done” system, get a bad rap for expecting you to build all your new habits at once, jumping immediately into a whole new lifestyle. That sort of all-or-nothing change can work for some people, but it might not be for you. But ZTD is focused on building them incrementally and more peacefully. There's room to adjust and grow, which can be soothing—especially if you have a lot of habits to change or you're particularly stuck in your ways.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThe habit changes come in a series, but one at a time, allowing you to focus on the actual work you need to get done. In the original version of ZTD, there are 10 habits, but you should only try to incorporate two to three of them at one time before moving on to others.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCollect by always taking notes about what you need to do, ideas you have, or changes to a task or project.Process by making quick decisions on tasks that are in front of you right now, like emails that could soon pile up. Plan by setting goals for your week every Monday, and tackling larger tasks earlier in the week.Do by selecting a task and focusing on it without thinking about or doing anything else. Create a simple trusted system that works for you, like doing certain tasks at the same time every day or tapping into an email system like the 4Ds with consistenc.Organize by giving everything a place—and putting it there every time. This goes for emails, tools on your desk, and anything else that’s cluttering your mind or space. Review your weekly goals at the end of the week, but also keep tabs on your longer-term quarterly or annual goals to keep them fresh in your mind and see how your daily work plays into them. Simplify by using your review time to slash your goals and tasks into only what’s most essential at any given time. Make a routine that works for you, whether it’s a calmer morning routine, or  more structured evenings—and absolutely stick to it. Find your passion and make sure it’s guiding your work. This is where ZTD differs from other productivity methods: You should always strive to keep the things you care about at the center of what you’re doing, as a reminder of why you’re working so hard or a check on whether a project is really worth it all.Over the past year, I've adopted a few of these changes: collect (and, by extension, plan), plus process and organize. I've been dedicated to growing financially and becoming more organized, but I knew neither of those things would happen overnight, so I started writing down \"to-dos\" whenever they popped into my head. I stick them in a note in my phone, reorganize the note every Monday, and check it every morning to see what I can do—then jump straight into the things that are attainable in that moment. The other day, I noticed my fan was dirty but I didn't have time to clean it write then, so I wrote a note—clean the fan—in my phone, and was able to follow up on it the next day without stressing. Making changes and getting things done bit by bit in this way has resulted in major financial wins and a significantly cleaner, more organized home. It's a far cry from how things went in the past, when I put too much pressure on myself to change instantly. Get started with “Minimalist ZTD”All of that sounds like a lot—and it is, even though you’re only supposed to start rolling in the habits one at a time. So pull back a bit: Babauta considers the first four (collect, process, plan, and do) the core of a “Minimalist ZTD” program, and advises picking one of them and focusing on it for 30 days. After a month, you’ll be in the habit of using that approach to your work and can move on to one of the other three. And once the four big are securely ingrained in your habits, you can move on to the full list.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

When you click a function, that function is supposed to do what it says it does. So, when you click \"Update and shut down\" on your PC, you assume your PC will install any available updates, then shut down. Simple.As you might expect from this headline, that isn't actually the case. For some reason, when you choose \"Update and shut down,\" Windows only listens to the first half of the command. Sure, your updates will download and install, but if you watch your computer, you'll see that it doesn't shut down, but restarts instead. That might come as a surprise, especially if you walked away from your PC under the assumption that it would power down completely. After all, that's what Microsoft, and the rest of the computing industry, usually means by \"shut down.\"The implications can range from annoying to detrimental. If you don't want your computer running, you'll likely be frustrated to find your PC still on when you return to it. But if you have a Windows laptop, perhaps this quirk ends up draining your battery. You assumed your PC would shut down, and your battery would be about the same as when you left it. But now, you have a dead or dying PC, and you have to worry about how to get it charged—all because you trusted a function when it said it would shut down your computer. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nA bug long in the makingInterestingly, this is an issue that Microsoft has avoided fixing for quite a while now. According to Windows Latest, the problem is caused by is a bug that originated with Windows 10. Microsoft just never fixed the glitch, and, as such, it carried over to Windows 11. If you're a long-time Windows user, you might have been dealing with this odd situation for years.Luckily, this is changing. Microsoft added a fix for this bug as part of the October 2025 optional update (KB5067036). For the rest of us, the company is including the patch as part of Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday update. That update is set to arrive on Nov. 11, as Patch Tuesday updates drop on the second Tuesday of each month. \n    \n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    \n\nWindows Latest asked Microsoft what exactly caused this bug, but didn't receive an answer. The outlet theorizes that the issue is probably related the Windows' servicing stack, the part of the OS responsible for installing Windows updates. For some reason, the \"power off\" task doesn't carry over after Windows finishes installing updates.If you want to fix this problem now, install either the October update, or wait for the Nov. 11 update. Either way, you can install the updates from Start > Settings > Windows Update—or, of course, use the \"Update and shut down\" function. With any luck, that should be the last time your PC restarts when it's supposed to shut down.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

We should listen to them.\n    \n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        November 10, 2025\n    \n            Credit: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Your personal productivity may be dependent on your unique needs, personality, and circumstances, but there are still general “laws” governing time management and potential output that apply to pretty much everyone—like, actual \"laws\" named after the people who came up with them. Economists, philosophers, and scientists have spent a lot of their own time researching what practices make a person more productive. Here’s an overview of the rules all that research has given us. The Yerkes-Dodson LawThe Yerkes-Dodson Law says a person is most productive when they have just the right amount of stress pushing them—not too much and not too little. It models the relationship between stress levels and performance, resulting in an upside-down, U-shaped curve on a quadrant. Across the X axis, you have your low-stress moments on the left, high-stress moments on the right, and a peak of productivity in the middle. The Y axis shows your peak performance at the top, which is aligned with times when you have just a the right amount of stress behind your work. This means that you shouldn’t give yourself too much time to do a task, but should definitely not wait until the last minute. The way to do this is to create airtight to-do lists. Try the 1-3-5 method, which has you structure your day around one major task, three medium-sized ones, and five little ones. By breaking your day down and timing it just right, you can make sure everything gets done when it needs to, optimizing your stress in honor of psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nParkinson’s LawParkinson’s Law is another one that governs how long you should spend on any given task. In fact, it goes hand-in-hand with Yerkes-Dodson, because it says that the longer you give yourself to do something, the longer you'll naturally take to get it done. C. Northcote Parkinson popularized it in a 1955 essay for The Economist, concluding that you’ll ultimately procrastinate or over-complicate the task, dragging it out by not working on it enough or working on it way too long. Here, it helps to prioritize your to-dos and schedule your days and weeks thoroughly. Having a smaller window in which to work on pressing tasks will up the urgency, aligning you more with the peak of Yerkes-Dodson. Pre-plan your weeks using prioritization techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix and task batching, thinking about when you'll have just the right amount of urgency to motivate you to do each task.Once you've pre-plannned, try shaving the amount of time you give yourself to do things. If a project is due a week from now, don’t give yourself a whole week to get it done. Instead, Give yourself a personal deadline of five or even four days from now. Setting private deadlines ahead of your real ones is a good way to give your work some urgency while leaving a little wiggle room in case you don’t finish up in time for your personal deadline. It stops you from procrastinating or getting too in the weeds on busywork at the end. Illich’s LawThe third law here is cautioning against the same thing as the first two: You shouldn’t have too much time to work on any one thing. The reasons behind all three laws are different, though, which means the solutions to overcoming them are unique, too. Illich’s Law, or the Law of Diminishing Returns, says that after working for a while, your productivity decreases. Eventually, it goes negative, meaning your work isn’t even good anymore. At best, you're churning out something less than ideal. At worst, you'll waste more time in the future having to redo it.To defeat it, don’t just cut your deadlines down to combat Parkinson's Law; cut down how long you have to work on each task on your to-do list. Use time-tracking software or a simple spreadsheet for two weeks to track how long your usual duties typically take you, as well as when you start feeling bored or unproductive. After two weeks, cut the time you give yourself to do each task, ideally down to exactly how long it takes you to get bored or unproductive. In the gaps that appear in your schedule, make sure you take breaks. What Yerkes-Dodson and Parkinson’s Law don’t fully account for is the value of breaks to productivity. Giving yourself set times to work and set times to chill is foundational to all kinds of productivity methods because burnout is an output killer. You can (and should) always get back to work once you’re done with a little personal time. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCarlson’s LawFinally, the fourth law, Carlson’s Law, is all about how you work, not how much you work. Swedish economist Sune Carlson’s assertion was that interrupted work is always less effective and more time-consuming than uninterrupted work. If you’re distracted, your work will be of a poorer quality and take longer—and as you can tell, work that takes longer is no good, for all kinds of reasons. Like the other laws, the trick to nailing this one is to schedule carefully every day. Not only do you need to schedule your day based on what needs to be done and how long it will take, but on when you can reasonably do it all without distraction. Time boxing, or the practice of scheduling every minute of your day in your calendar, blocking it all out down to the minute, is central to basically every productivity tip. In line with both Illich's and Carlson's Laws, not only should you keep in mind that you should give yourself less time to work than you think you need, but you should reflect that cut-down in your time boxes. When you do that, you'll see gaps or breaks start to appear in your daily calendar. Embrace those. Breaks are elemental to productivity, so you should be scheduling those as seriously as you do your work. Finally, when you’re aiming to defeat Carlson’s Law, you should take the extra step of making sure your now-thorough calendar is viewable by others in your organization or anyone who might interrupt you. If you’re likely to be distracted at a given time, don’t try to work on anything important then; wait until you can give it your full attention. In addition, never multitask. You can’t do two things at once. That’s just another form of distraction. Move from chore to chore, one at a time, to make sure you’re being efficient at all of them. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

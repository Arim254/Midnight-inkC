Users have spent that time generating hyper-realistic vertical videos that, despite their watermarks, might already be fooling people on the internet. I, for one, see nothing good about a tool that can make these types of videos from simple prompts, perhaps outside the sheer novelty alone. But the app is undeniably popular, and, as expected, OpenAI is continuing to \"improve\" it. On Wednesday, the head of Sora, Bill Peebles, shared a roadmap of updates coming to the app, from cameos for your pets to video editing tools. Sora will soon let you make cameos of anything you wantPeebles says that \"character cameos\" are on their way in the coming days. When this feature drops, you'll be able to make cameos of just about anything you want, including your pets (Peebles suggests your dog or guinea pig), stuffed toys, as well as AI-generated characters Sora may have produced in your past videos.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nCameos are a defining, and controversial, Sora feature. It lets you scan your likeness into the app so you can create videos featuring yourself. Not only that, you can remix videos with cameos of anyone else who has scanned themself into Sora—assuming their permissions allow you to use their cameos. It's impressive tech, but it raises major ethical concerns, considering you can make someone else do or say things they never signed off on. Now, apparently, you'll also be able to do the same with the family cat or your childhood stuffed animal. Following these additional cameo options, Peebles says you'll be able to see \"the latest trending cameos in real time.\" I'm guessing the idea is to browse the most popular cameos on the platform, and, if you want to, add them to your own videos. Sora is also getting basic video editing tools. According to Peebles, this starts with the ability to stitch multiple clips together, though other \"powerful new features\" will follow. Peebles says the Sora team is also working on reducing \"excessive moderation,\" which he acknowledges is \"super annoying\" to users, as well as improving the app's performance.Speaking of apps, Android users will soon have their chance to try Sora. Right now, the app is iOS-only, but Sora's Android version is \"actually coming soon,\" Peebles says.  A reminder to be wary of what you see on the internetAs critical and cynical as I am about Sora and services like it, I can see the utility here. I imagine people will get a kick out of being able to put their pets in any situation they want. And if they want to make fried eggs sing a song, or a stuffed animal say \"hello,\" more power to them. But my main concerns with this app are not assuaged by any of these updates: Sora still lets you generate convincing videos with a simple prompt, with the only safeguard a watermark that's easy to remove if you know where to look. People were already falling for fake videos on the internet before these tools came along; now, it's becoming way too difficult to know whether what you're watching is actually real or not. If you ask me, you're better off assuming all of it is fake.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

But some users who opted for the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are claiming that the color they picked isn't the color they see today. According to these users, their iPhones have changed color over the short period of time they've owned them. Obviously, the internet has dubbed the issue \"colorgate.\" Apple is no stranger to \"gates,\" of course, especially when it comes to the iPhone: There was \"antennagate,\" when the iPhone 4's redesigned antennas reported caused cellular connection issues; \"bendgate,\" when the iPhone 6 Plus was prone to physically bending; and most recently, \"scratchgate,\" where the aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro Max appeared susceptible to scratching easily.Now, colorgate is here to further draw criticism to the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. Customers such as DakAttack316 on Reddit are claiming their Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pros are turning pink—or, if you want to give it an \"Apple label,\" rose gold. It's tough not to see the reason this would bother people: Apple's advertisements for the Cosmic Orange iPhones highlight a vibrant and striking orange. The iPhone in the photos from DakAttack316 looks more sunburnt than anything else. The wireless charging pad remains a somewhat bright orange, but the aluminum has taken on a salmon hue. The orange accents throughout the phone also seem to have been affected, with some looking faded or dirty. Maybe if the entire iPhone was all one pinkish hue, it wouldn't look so bad, but the variety of colors visible in the photo make it look damaged.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDakAttack316's might be among the most viral accounts of the issue, but they aren't alone. Take this post for instance: The issue isn't quite as pronounced, but you can clearly see how faded the orange metal is, especially when directly compared to another Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro Max. Meanwhile, this viral TikTok shows some more selective discoloration on different elements of an iPhone 17 Pro. \nIt's not clear what is causing these issues, or how many Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pros are affected. Some theories suggest that using the wrong type of solvent to clean your iPhone, such as bleach or hydrogen peroxide, could be causing or contributing to the discoloration, since Apple says these chemicals shouldn't be used on iPhones. (Even if that isn't the case, it's always good practice to abstain from treating your devices with cleaning solutions unless the manufacturer has officially approved those chemicals.)Should people stop buying the iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange?No. We don't know why this is happening yet, or how widespread the issue is, but if a statistically significant number of Cosmic Orange iPhones were having this issue, you'd likely be seeing a lot more complaints than you are at the moment—especially considering the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are selling better than expected.Maybe these users were treating their iPhones with harsh chemical cleaners; perhaps a small number of Cosmic Orange iPhones have a manufacturing defect. Whatever the cause turns out to be, it doesn't appear to be something afflicting the majority of the devices. Compare these two Reddit posts showing off pink Cosmic Orange iPhones, with this thread of users who are happy with their color choice. It's all anecdotal evidence, of course, but for the moment, I'm just not seeing very many users complaining about sunburnt iPhones.If you do buy a Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro, and it does turn pink, take it to Apple or your carrier. So long as you didn't clean it with bleach, the company will almost assuredly swap it out for you—hopefully for a device that won't fade with age.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

I usually see red light therapy advertised for \"younger-looking skin,\" but I'm not interested in these devices as a means to slow down aging—I'm interested in them as a recovery-obsessed athlete with very sore muscles.These gadgets promise to boost athletic performance, speed muscle recovery, and reduce inflammation, all by bathing your body in specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light. But do these trendy tools live up to the hype, especially for muscle recovery?What red light therapy advocates claimRed light therapy devices typically emit light in the red (620-670 nanometers) and near-infrared (800-850 nanometers) spectrum. Manufacturers claim these wavelengths penetrate the skin to stimulate cellular activity, specifically targeting the mitochondria (the energy-producing powerhouses inside our cells). The purported benefits include enhanced muscle recovery, reduced inflammation, improved circulation, decreased muscle soreness, and even performance gains.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIt all sounds scientific enough: the light supposedly helps mitochondria produce more ATP (cellular energy) and triggers the release of beneficial compounds like nitric oxide, which improves blood flow and activates repair processes throughout the body. But let's dig into what these gadgets can actually do.What the science actually saysSurprise, surprise: The science is more nuanced than marketing materials suggest. According to Dr. Wesley Buckle, a licensed naturopathic doctor, \"the data on red light therapy is not definitive. Some studies show that it can help with delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle recovery. However, the evidence is mixed. Most of the studies that have found a positive benefit are small, short-term ones.\"While the research shows potential, there's a significant gap between what manufacturers claim and what the evidence actually supports, Buckle says he's seen \"claims of enhanced performance, improved circulation, and muscle recovery\" that are ultimately overblown. \"The evidence supports mild improvements in muscle fatigue. It doesn't support dramatic claims of large gains and strength or performance boosts.\"This is a crucial distinction. If you're expecting red light therapy to transform your performance or replace proper training, you'll be disappointed. The benefits appear to be modest and supportive rather than revolutionary.Another critical factor is device quality. McCall McPherson, a physician associate and founder at Modern Thyroid Clinic and Modern Weight Loss, says that \"not all devices are created equal. The effectiveness depends heavily on the wavelengths used, power output, and build quality of the device.\" It's important to distinguish between medical-grade panels built with specific, researched wavelengths and all the cheaper consumer devices that may not deliver the necessary light intensity or correct wavelengths to produce biological effects.There's certainly promising research, but this research is based on specific wavelengths (typically 620-670 nm for red light and 800-850 nm for near-infrared) and specific energy doses. Many budget-friendly devices don't meet these parameters, which means they're unlikely to produce the results seen in clinical studies.Should you consider red light therapy?For the average athlete, red light therapy could be a useful addition to a recovery routine—but with important caveats. Buckle advises prioritizing the fundamentals: \"Sleep, nutrition, and proper training are all extremely important. Without these things, red light therapy won't help. It can't replace these practices...Red light therapy could be a good supportive recovery tool for most people. However, it's best to focus on the basics first, such as proper training.\"McPherson is more enthusiastic, saying, \"I really do think red light therapy can be a great recovery tool for casual athletes when used correctly.\" She notes that for best results, athletes should look for quality medical-grade devices and use them consistently right before or after workouts on the specific muscles trained. \"It's not magic,\" says McPherson, \"but it's one of the most well-researched, noninvasive tools we have for reducing soreness and speeding up recovery between workouts.\"The bottom lineRed light therapy for muscle recovery isn't pure snake oil; there's legitimate science supporting its use as a supportive recovery tool. However, the benefits appear to be modest improvements in muscle soreness and recovery rather than dramatic performance enhancements. The evidence is still evolving, with many studies being small and short-term.If you're considering adding red light therapy to your recovery arsenal, remember these key points: First, nail the basics. No amount of red light will compensate for poor sleep, inadequate nutrition, or improper training. Second, invest in quality. If you decide to try red light therapy, choose a medical-grade device with the correct wavelengths and power output rather than the cheapest option on Amazon. Third, be consistent. The research shows benefits with regular use, not occasional experimentation.Finally, manage your expectations. Think of red light therapy as a potentially helpful tool for reducing soreness and supporting recovery—not a miracle device that will dramatically transform your athletic performance. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Scroll through social media and you'll find countless influencers touting weighted vests as the secret to building unbreakable bones and sculpted muscles. Many videos have gained hundreds of thousands of views with claims that weighted vests will \"transform your body\"—a claim that, to be fair, is par for the course in any fitness trend. \"Weighted vest walks\" are popular enough to be parodied, and even if I find those videos a little mean-spirited, they do point to an important question: Does this trendy fitness accessory actually deliver on its promises?Let's dig into what science really says about weighted vests—and what they can (and can't) do for your body.The claim: Weighted vests can build bone density or stop bone lossI can see how this theory sounds legit. Bones respond to mechanical stress by becoming stronger—it's why astronauts lose bone density in zero gravity, and why weight-bearing exercise is recommended for osteoporosis prevention. So logically, strapping on extra weight should signal your bones to bulk up, right? Not exactly.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccording to Dr. Leah Verebes, a professor at the Touro School of Health Science's DPT program, the reality is more nuanced. \"Some research, particularly among elderly persons and postmenopausal women, suggests that the use of a weighted vest while exercising, or plain walking, can slow bone loss or improve bone density modestly—especially in the legs and hips,\" she says.However, the gains are far from dramatic. Verebes notes that \"results are variable and gains are minimal.\" Traditional resistance training like weightlifting and higher-impact activities like jogging or jumping produce significantly better results. A 2023 review found that while weighted vests may help maintain bone mineral density, the overall quality of evidence supporting this benefit remains low to moderate.Weighted vests can help maintain bone strength, particularly for people who can't tolerate high-impact exercise due to joint issues or other limitations. But they're not a substitute for proper resistance training or impact activities.The claim: Wearing a weighted vest builds muscle and increases strength.Here's where expectations need serious adjustment. Yes, adding weight to your body does increase the resistance during bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and step-ups. And yes, this can contribute to improvements in muscular endurance and modest strength gains. But there's a catch.\"Vest walking also increases caloric expenditure and activates muscles more than regular walking, but the weight is typically too low to induce significant muscle growth,\" Verebes says. Most weighted vests are designed to be 5-15% of your body weight—enough to make your workout harder, but not enough to trigger substantial muscle building.Think of it this way: If you weigh 150 pounds, a 10% weighted vest adds just 15 pounds. That's less resistance than you'd use for a basic strength training exercise. \"Significant muscle growth continues to require progressive resistance training with more substantial weights,\" Verebes says.So, weighted vests can intensify your workout and improve muscular endurance, but they won't replace a proper strength training program if your goal is building significant muscle mass.The risks nobody's posting aboutWhile social media showcases people effortlessly crushing workouts in weighted vests, the reality is that adding load to your body comes with real risks. Verebes says that \"too much excess weight can cause strain on joints, especially the knees, hips, and lower back.\" The increased load can also impair balance and increase fall risk, a particular concern for older adults who might be using vests specifically to improve bone health.Perhaps most concerning is the risk of overuse injuries when people add weight too quickly. \"Professionals recommend starting with a light vest—roughly 5–10% body weight—and adding to it gradually as strength and tolerance improve,\" Verebes says.What actually works for building strong bones and musclesIf you're serious about improving your musculoskeletal health, Verebes offers evidence-based recommendations:Prioritize resistance training. Weightlifting or using resistance bands remain the most effective methods for keeping bones and muscles strong. Progressive overload—gradually increasing the weight you lift—is key to continued improvement.Include impact and weight-bearing exercise. Walking, hiking, stair climbing, and jumping all provide bone stimulation. Activities that involve impact force your bones to adapt and strengthen.Support exercise with proper nutrition. You can't out-train a poor diet. Adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D are essential for maintaining bone and muscle health. Without proper nutrition, even the best exercise program will fall short.So, should you use a weighted vest?Look, weighted vests aren't worthless. They can add challenge to bodyweight exercises and walking routines, providing modest improvements in muscle endurance and bone maintenance, particularly for older adults or those unable to do high-impact activities.But as Verebes says, \"they are not a shortcut to get to stronger bones and bigger muscles overnight. For significant improvements, regular resistance training and impact exercise remain the gold standard.\"The bottom line? Weighted vests are a tool, not a miracle solution. If you do decide to try a weighted vest, start conservatively with 5-10% of your body weight, add load gradually, and pay attention to how your joints respond. And crucially: Always speak with your doctor first, especially if you have existing joint problems, balance issues, or bone density concerns.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

While it's supposed to show me what the next big game is ahead of time, the truth is, there are just too many games and too many types of players out there for it to keep up anymore. My tastes probably aren't the same as yours, and limiting the highlights to a small selection of popular picks could bury smaller titles some players might be more interested in. That's why I'm so excited about Steam's new Personal Calendar page.Released last night, it's technically an experiment, but it's already looking great. Essentially, rather than showing you a generic list of ten games like the Popular Upcoming tab (I have no idea how Valve picks those games, by the way), this instead shows you a personally curated selection of recently released and upcoming games, organized on a daily calendar, and up through the next eight weeks. The specifics depend on how you customize it, but already, it's far more useful for me than the Popular Upcoming tab.To check it out, either click here for the web version or open your Steam desktop client, and next to the search bar, navigate to Special Sections > Steam Labs > 016 Personal Calendar.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhen you first open the calendar, you'll see 100 games, split across titles released last month, titles released in the last seven days, and titles that aren't out yet. At time of writing, I currently see suggested games through Dec. 12, which gives me a pretty good window of what to look forward to. If you're eagle-eyed, you might notice that the Personal Calendar excludes weekends, which Valve says is because most games don't release on weekends. If a game Valve wants to suggest does release on a weekend, it'll instead show up on the following Monday.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nAs for the curation, I'm satisfied. Unlike the Popular Upcoming tab, the Personal Calendar uses a combination of your wishlist and your playtime in certain games to decide what to show you, making for a list that's catered to your tastes. Lately, I've been playing a lot of platformers and RPGs, and low and behold, my Personal Calendar opened right up to suggestions like Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles and Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake. These are bigger titles, but there are smaller choices I might have otherwise overlooked peppered in, and it already seems like a great way to make sure I don't miss out on a game I'd like. I even appreciate the heads-up about recently released games, which are easy to think about once and then forget.The one criticism I have is that the default of 100 games looks a little overstuffed to me. Luckily, you can slim down your suggestions to anywhere from ten to fifty games (at the top of the page, under Game Count), which also has the benefit of narrowing down the algorithm to only show you what it thinks you'd enjoy most. Or, if you want to see as many options as possible, you can also have the calendar display 250 or 500 games. There are also controls to only show games with specific tags, and also to exclude games you've wishlisted or already own.Essentially, the Personal Calendar feels like a personalized and easy-to-check version of those \"Biggest Game Releases of the Month\" videos, except you don't need to constantly rewind or pull up the video again whenever you're looking for what to play next. Valve says your Calendar's algorithm gets re-trained daily, though, so don't expect to always see the same games on it every time you check it. If you see a game you're interested in but aren't ready to pull the trigger on yet, wishlisting it is still your best bet.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Over the past 24 hours, multiple users on Reddit have complained about being unable to call 911, while the Bell carrier in Canada issued a warning that the Pixel 6 and up was also having problems contacting emergency services on its network.According to user Fabulous_Disaster730, who posted yesterday about difficulties contacting emergency services during a gas leak, her Pixel 9 Pro repeatedly prompted her to turn on wifi calling or turn off airplane mode before she could call 911, despite her having full signal on both 5G and wifi. The phone would then freeze and restart. After multiple attempts, she resorted to asking a friend to place the call for her instead.Multiple replies mentioned facing similar problems yesterday as well, across multiple networks and models of Pixel. Bell, however, was the only carrier to issue an official notice.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAside from the obvious danger, the problem with this bug is that it's not consistent. Despite seemingly having had a surge yesterday, it's been a known issue as far back as 2021. However, it doesn't affect all users, nor is it entirely predictable when or how it will pop up. While recent reports are of calls simply not going through, one user posted two months ago that their call did go through, but they only heard screeching and static on the other end of the line. These recent reports are only the latest in an ever-evolving concern.It's also not clear what's causing the problem. In 2021, the problem was attributed to Microsoft Teams, but even with that error patched up, users are still facing problems. To Google's credit, Bell said it reached out to the company shortly after it learned about yesterday's uptick in cases, and afterwards said that a fix had been issued. However, no other carriers have issued similar notices, and I wouldn't be surprised to see other users making their own complaints in the future.It's worth noting that Bell mentioned that Pixel 6 users and up were the ones affected this time around, and that the Pixel 6 also happened to release in 2021, which is when the bug first started making news. Whatever is at the core of the problem here, I wouldn't be surprised if it worked its way in on the Pixel 6 and just hasn't yet been addressed.However, given the severity of the issue, it's something that needs looking at sooner rather than later. I've reached out to Google for comment on this issue, and will update if I hear back. In the meantime, it's best to be prepared in case the worst happens. If you're on a Pixel phone, here's what you can do to contact 911 in an emergency:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFirst, try to place a 911 callIf you have time and the danger is not immediate, it's worth trying to call 911 on your Pixel despite the issues. While users reporting problems have increased as of late, it's still not an everyone or every time problem. It's possible your call will still go through without issue.You can also text 911If, however, you are unable to call 911, it's worth remembering that in certain jurisdictions (check this regularly updated list to see if where you live is supported), you can also contact 911 via text. This is a slower method of reaching out for help, but is still better than nothing. To text 911, open your texting app, put in 911 as the recipient, and write a concise message with your issue, your location, and any necessary specifics, like cross streets, landmarks, a specific hiding location, or whether you're able to talk.Use a backup phoneWhile I don't expect someone who isn't constantly reviewing tech to have multiple phones on hand, the surest method to ensure you'll be able to call 911 if you're on a Pixel is to keep a backup phone that isn't a Pixel handy. This could be a landline or another cell phone. Crucially, it can be an old cell phone, even one that isn't actively attached to a phone plan. So long as your phone is able to connect to a network, it's legally required to be able to call 911, so if you have an old phone you've upgraded from and haven't traded in laying around, it may be smart to keep it charged up in case you need it in an emergency.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Last week, the company announced ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration. At the moment, it's Mac-only, but I wouldn't recommend even my Apple friends jumping on board immediately—at least not without understanding the underlying risks. Atlas' AI web browsing\nIf you've already used other AI browsers, like Perplexity's Comet, Atlas is going to feel familiar. In fact, that's also likely true if you've used any web browser before: Atlas is built on Chromium, the engine that powers browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. That means the core mechanics of Atlas are fairly standard; there's nothing particularly revolutionary happening here when it comes to sorting tabs or the browsing experience itself. The same is true when it comes to some ChatGPT interactions. As with other AI browsers, ChatGPT is assigned to the sidebar of the browser window. You can call it up by clicking on the \"Ask ChatGPT\" button, where you can ask it questions about the content you're currently browsing. You can also ask ChatGPT for writing assistance any time you enter an open text field in the browser. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nLike Comet, Atlas has an agent mode, but the latter's is built off the existing ChatGPT agent. The idea is that you can task Atlas with performing functions on your behalf. So, rather than pulling up DoorDash's website and ordering yourself dinner, you could ask Atlas to order dinner for you. You can even watch Atlas get to work, and see its thinking behind each decision. OpenAI has other ideas for how to use Atlas' agent mode, including giving the browser a recipe to shop for, or asking the bot to run through team documents at work to generate a brief. Deeper ChatGPT integration is what might set Atlas apart from the competition. If you're a regular ChatGPT user, you'll probably appreciate it having that contextual awareness of your past conversations—if you've already asked ChatGPT about a topic, and you're currently researching it in a browser window, you can pick up the conversation and assume ChatGPT will remember what you've already talked about.        \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAi\n                    \n    \nSimilarly, Atlas will track your browsing and activity history and call upon it in future sessions. Perhaps you'll open your browser to find personalized suggestions on which sites and topics to explore next. Does that sound creepy? Absolutely. But if you're someone who doesn't mind the privacy trade-off, there could be some benefits there. In OpenAI's announcement, it suggested asking Atlas to pull up all the job postings you looked at last week, and produce a summary of industry trends to use in interview prep. If you find that these memories are a bit too much for you, you can disable them from the browser settings. (OpenAI says deleting your browsing history also deletes associated browser memories, and the browser's incognito window logs you out of ChatGPT.)The company includes a setting called \"ChatGPT page visibility,\" which lets you control whether ChatGPT can actually see the webpage you're visiting. If you choose \"Not Allowed,\" you can block the bot from seeing what you're doing, which is good. But then again, doing that defeats the purpose of Atlas a bit. If you don't want ChatGPT seeing what you're doing, you might as well use a browser that doesn't have ChatGPT built right into it. (The company does promise it won't train ChatGPT on your browsing data unless you opt into it, but why would you do that?)Is Atlas safe to use?\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nI'm of the opinion that if the safety of a browser is in question, it's best not to bother with. That's the case with Atlas, as well as other AI browsers, which is why I'm making it a bit of a personal rule from here on out to not download or use them on my personal computers.The main issue with browsers that incorporate AI agents is that they are susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks. Brave has done a lot of research on this subject, particularly with Comet. In short, bad actors can potentially hide malicious instructions on websites that the AI agents see as no different from a typical user request. Because the browser is designed to act on your behalf, these malicious instructions can command the AI to do things you definitely don't want it to do. You might ask Atlas to summarize a webpage, but because a bad actor hid a command to do something involving your email, bank account, or corporate intranet on the site, it does that instead. To OpenAI's credit, the company has compiled a list of safeguards to mitigate risks with Atlas. Atlas cannot run code directly in the browser, nor can it download files or install extensions. The browser has no way to access other apps on your Mac, nor its file system. If agent mode needs to access sensitive sites, like your bank, it'll pause to make sure \"you're watching.\" To that point, you can use Atlas' agent in logged out mode, which limits its ability to access sensitive data or take actions \"as you\" on websites. But even OpenAI admits that after thousands of hours of testing, their safeguards \"will not stop every attack that emerges as AI agents grow in popularity.\" The company says it'll patch new vulnerabilities as it finds them, but if bad actors find them first, they might trick these AI agents into doing some terrible things.That assertion has already been proven right. Within Atlas' first few days available to the public, one researcher discovered the browser is susceptible to clipboard injection attacks, in which bad actors can lace elements of their website with code that would add malicious links to your clipboard when clicked. Since Atlas can act on your behalf, you might not even realize if it clicks on such a button, and, as such, you may accidentally paste the malicious link into your browser yourself. To me, the risks currently far outweigh the benefits. I don't yet see much reason to have a bot in my browser do things on my behalf, but even if I did, I wouldn't use it just yet. The risk that someone injects a website with a malicious command and derails my AI agent—and my digital life—is too great, especially when I can book those flights or order that delivery on my own without issue.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        I broke one of the biggest rules in the running book and lived to tell about it. Everybody knows you need to replace your running shoes after 300 to 500 miles to avoid injury (or 200 to 400, or whatever running companies are saying these days). Well, I put over 1,000 miles on mine, and I’m not sorry. I know it’s been over 1,000 miles because I’ve been tracking my shoes’ mileage in the Garmin Connect app. My watch logs the mileage, and I make sure the credit goes to the appropriate shoe in the app. I carefully ported my shoe miles to and from the Coros app when I switched ecosystems for a bit this past summer. Some of my runs are in a trail shoe, some in a water-resistant shoe, and the rest are in my Nike Downshifters. That four-digit number in the app is real, and I’m sure of it. What are these magic shoes? \n    \n            \n            Some rips in the upper, but honestly looking pretty good for their age.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nMeet the honored pair. These are the Nike Downshifter 12, in a women’s U.S. size 8.5. I bought them from Amazon in 2024 and paid $66.94 including tax. As I’m writing this, my records show I’ve worn them for 294 activities since June 25 of last year, and they’ve logged a total of 1,024 miles in running workouts. (That’s 6.5 cents per mile, surely a personal record.) For context I run about 20-30 miles most weeks, often but not always in these shoes. \nThe Downshifter is a beginner-level running shoe from Nike, but I’m a lifelong runner, not a beginner. I bought my first pair of them out of frustration with other shoes. See, I always bought Nike Frees, but Nike kept changing the Free from year to year. Some I liked, some I didn’t. Over time, it seemed like the Frees were getting more expensive every year, and wearing out sooner. Often within a few months of purchase, the foam underfoot would wear unevenly and I’d be running on uncomfortable lumps.So one day in 2023, I decided I needed to find a shoe that would either last longer, or would be cheap enough that I wouldn’t care. (I ended up with a shoe that checked both boxes.) I browsed sales and bought two pairs, including a purple pair of Downshifter 12’s. I didn’t love them right out of the box, but over the season, they became my favorites. I ran in them all spring and summer, and then ran a half-marathon in them that fall. Afterward, I looked up some reviews of the Downshifters, just for fun. One said that the Downshifter is “not the shoe for runners regularly going over four miles.” I laughed. I replaced those purple Downshifters with a new (black) pair in 2024, just because it had been a while and they were probably close to the oft-advised 500-mile limit. That’s what you’re supposed to do, right? Why did I put 1,000 miles on these shoes? Fate had something different in mind for these new Downshifters. I was curious how long they would last, so I entered them into the gear logging section of my Garmin app. When you add a new shoe, Garmin asks you to set a mileage target so it can let you know when to replace them. I put 500. After every run, Garmin would automatically add up my miles. (If I ran in a different pair of shoes, I’d make sure to note that—I’ve put about 200 miles each on two other pairs of shoes within this timeframe.) When I had over 400 miles on the black Downshifters, I ordered a new pair, which still sits untouched in its shoebox to this day. At 500, I ignored the notification to replace my shoes. At 600, “I wonder if I can get these to 1,000” was a dumb thought that entered my head and did not leave. For comparison, here is how they looked at 500 miles: \n    \n            \n            How they looked at 500 miles. There's still some tread on the heel, and the upper is in OK shape.\n                                        Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n                    \n    \nI kept tracking my shoe mileage carefully. This dumb thought is why I was so particular about keeping the miles-per-shoe numbers accurate even when I switched apps. The day I hit 1,000 was an anti-climax. I remember them being at 998 miles before joining my husband for an early morning run a few weeks ago. I mentioned to him during the run that the shoes were probably crossing 1,000 miles at that exact moment. “Nice!” he said, and we jogged on. I’ve kept running in them since then. I ran in them today. They feel fine. Why I think these shoes lasted so longI’m no shoe-construction expert, but judging from the feel, it seems there’s just a simple slab of foam under my foot. My previous pairs, the less-durable ones, may have had lighter foams and they usually had more complicated shapes, with cutouts and grooves and such. The running shoes on the market are all so different that I don’t think it’s fair to come up with a blanket mileage recommendation that applies to everything. I’ve had running shoes that felt awful to run in after probably less than 100 miles. And then there are others that can go, apparently, 10 times as long. These Downshifters are the first pair where I confirmed the exact mileage, but I can think of two other pairs that seemed to last forever: an original 2004 Free 5.0, and a “Free RN Distance” from sometime in the 2010s. I replaced the 2004s when I realized I needed to go a half size bigger to avoid black toenails during marathon training. (No idea of the mileage, but I’d been using them off-and-on for eight years at that point.) I got rid of the RN Distance shoes during a decluttering binge because I hated the color. I soon regretted that decision. Neither pair actually wore out. My unscientific opinion is that these shoes lasted so long because they were simple. Just a slab of foam, no fancy shaping, and certainly no high-performance foam technology that might give better dynamics at the cost of longevity. Or maybe I was just lucky. Who knows.What I think of shoe mileage rules in generalThe advice to replace your shoes after 300 to 500 miles originated with a 1985 study that only tested shoes up to 500 miles, no further. It used a machine to simulate the effects of running. After 50 miles, shoes from several manufacturers only had 75% of their initial shock absorption capability. Between 250 and 500 miles, they were down to 60%. (The machine was harder on the shoes than actual runners; after 500 miles, human-worn shoes still had 70% of their initial shock absorption.) Surely shoe foams in 2025 are not the same as in 1984. And surely the various shoe models on the market are all different from each other in construction and foam type. But still the 300 to 500 mile rule has persisted, and I have to wonder if shoe makers are designing their shoes to meet the expectation of a 300 to 500 mile lifespan. A fascinating article at Runner’s World gets into detail about the different foams that are used these days and what we know about how long they last. Some “super shoes” lose their peak performance after just 100 miles, but even a worn-out super shoe may still perform better than a brand new budget shoe. The article doesn’t make any mileage recommendations, instead landing on advice to “listen to your body, rather than relying on arbitrary yardsticks.” I’ve also collected some advice from experienced runners on Reddit on how often they actually switch out their shoes, and as you might expect, the answers are all over the place. There are people who set a hard cap on the mileage they’ll allow a shoe to accrue, and others who go based on vibes. Some people only get 300 miles out of each pair; others say they routinely take theirs into the quadruple digits. Ultimately I don’t think much of any rule, and I’m skeptical of the idea that worn-out shoes are a recipe for injury. Running itself is a recipe for injury—I dare you to find an experienced runner who hasn’t dealt with some type of overuse injury, even if they follow every rule in the book. I think some runners use a shoe mileage cap as sort of a good-luck talisman. But injury isn’t that predictable, and neither our bodies nor our shoes will always behave in a predictable way over the years. Some shoes agree with our bodies better than others, and some last longer than others. When you find a pair that works for you, you might as well stick with it. \n            ",

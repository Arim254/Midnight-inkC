Suunto's route-planning tool lets you create and download GPX files without even creating an account. No paywall, no trial period—just open the page and start planning routes. And the tool itself works great.What you can do with the Suunto RouteplannerThe tool packs in everything you'd expect from a paid service, and then some:Route creation that uses different map types (outdoor, satellite, even specialized ones for winter and avalanche terrain)Routing that optimizes for your activity (running, hiking, cycling, mountaineering, roller skating, and more), using actual heat map data from real athletesHeat map overlays for about a dozen different sports so you can see where people actually goElevation profiles with ascent and descent numbers (crucial for not dying on climbs you didn't see coming)Export routes as GPX files that work with basically any GPS deviceShareable link generation (good for six months) so you can send routes to friends without making them create accounts eitherAbility to import and modify existing GPX or FIT files from other platformsOptional account sync if you own Suunto or Hammerhead gearYou don't even need to be in Suunto's ecosystem to use this. I was able to export a map to my Garmin watch with no problem. If you do have a Suunto or Hammerhead device, you can link your account and routes will sync automatically. \nHow to use the Suunto RouteplannerGo to routeplanner.suunto.com. From there, creating a route is pretty straightforward. If you let your browser share your location, it'll center on where you are. If not, just search for wherever you want to start. The controls on the right side let you switch between map types. The usual suspects are there: outdoor, satellite, light, dark. But then it gets weird in the best ways with a winter map, an avalanche terrain map for backcountry stuff, and, in a show of national pride, a dedicated Finland Terrain map. Respect.To actually connect points on the map, you have the following options:Free drawing (no automatic routing)Any road or path (ideal for activities by foot)All road types—avoiding hills (ideal for bikes)All road types (still ideal for bikes)Paved roads (ideal for road cycling)After you create your route, you simply download the GPX file and throw it on whatever GPS device you own.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe six-month shareable links are a nice touch too. You can plan a route for a group ride or run, send everyone the link, and they can grab it without jumping through hoops. It's the kind of friction-free sharing that should be standard but somehow isn't.Why you should try the Suunto RouteplannerStrava and Komoot have trained users to expect paywalls for route planning. Of course, this could be strategic on Suunto's part, to give away the software in the hopes of selling the hardware. Or maybe it's just goodwill after years of user complaints about Suunto closing their tracking system Movescount. Either way, users win. You get a legitimately useful tool without opening your wallet or handing over your email address.If you're already paying for route planning elsewhere, try this first. Worst case, you waste five minutes. Best case, you cancel a subscription and pocket the savings. Even if you'e not looking to save money, having another route planning option in your toolkit doesn't hurt.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Ars Technica has identified a scheme that abuses a Microsoft subscription feature to send phishing emails from [email protected], a real address that the company advises users to add to their allow lists. How the Microsoft Power BI scam worksUsers targeted with this scam have received emails from an address connected to Microsoft Power BI, a business analytics platform. The messages include (fake) billing receipts with large purchase amounts from services like PayPal, Norton LifeLock, and Microsoft 365 and a phone number to call to dispute the transaction. \nScammers on the other end of the line may try to convince you to install a remote access application that allows device takeover or will otherwise extract personal information. As with any phishing scam, engaging in any way—calling the number, responding to the email, or clicking links—could put your data and your device at risk. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe emails themselves are full of typos and grammar errors and urgent calls to action that are, in most cases, completely unrelated to Microsoft itself. Many users would spot these red flags and know to simply delete the message. However, threat actors capitalize on the trust users have in the brands they're exploiting along with scare tactics to trap some people in the scheme.  This is also far from the first phishing scheme of its kind: Threat actors have sent malicious emails from legitimate PayPal and Google addresses (to name just two) by exploiting similar loopholes. In the case of PayPal, fraudulent purchase notifications sent from service[at]paypal[dot]com abused the platform's subscription billing feature. With Google, scammers registered google.com subdomains via Google Sites and linked them with Google Accounts. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The platform is speedy, simple, and supports just about every streaming app out there.If you've got a Roku or two in your life, you may not be using it to its full potential. These tips, hacks, and hidden features should help you go beyond the basic business of launching your streaming apps and get more out of your hardware, whether you've just unboxed your first Roku device, or you've been using one for years.Set up PIN protection to protect your RokuIf you've got young kids or nosy housemates living with you, you can lock certain parts of the Roku experience (including making purchases and adding new channels) behind a PIN number. This is actually done through your Roku account page on the web: Click PIN/parental controls on the left, and you can set a new PIN or change an existing one.Change the look and feel of your Roku with a new themeYou don't have to settle for the standard Roku interface visuals—you can easily switch to a different theme (which basically means a different wallpaper and screensaver). From Settings on your device, choose Themes to see alternatives provided by Roku and other people in the Roku community. You can always pick Restore default theme to go back to the original look.Enable captions on replayYou might not want closed captions on all the time, but you can have them enabled whenever you skip backward. From the home screen, pick Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode > On replay to enable this. Note that the streaming app you're using needs to support the feature as well, so it may not work everywhere.Put your most-watched apps up topThis is a simple and effective one that you might not have got around to doing: You can organize the apps on the home screen so your most-used are nearer the top and easier to get to. Select any tile on the home screen, press the star button on your remote to bring up the context menu, and you'll see the Move app and Move app to top options.Make use of Guest Mode when you have company\n    \n            \n            Roku devices come with a Guest Mode included.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's great having guests—but don't let them mess up your recommendations and viewing progress. You can put your Roku device into Guest Mode by opening Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Guest Mode > Enter Guest Mode. You'll be signed out of all your apps, and the Roku device will restart ready for someone else to use it.Send your photos to your Roku to view them on the big screenYou won't always be watching films and shows on your Roku of course—and when your streaming device isn't doing anything else you can get images from your Google Photos library up on your TV. To set this up, you need to head to the Photostreams page on the Roku website, sign in using your account, and then follow the instructions online.Set up a cross-platform Roku watchlistThere will often be times when you see something interesting, but don't have time to watch it right away, and that's when the Roku watchlist feature can help. Select any movie or show from the home screen, and on the listing page use the Save button to add it to your list: You can then pick Save List from the main menu to see what you've saved.Pair your Bluetooth headphones to your RokuIf you've got a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and a Roku device that supports Bluetooth, you can pair the two together for some private audio listening— handy if you don't want to disturb anyone around you. You can do this by heading to Settings from the main Roku menu, then choosing Remotes & devices > Wireless headphones.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nListen to your Roku via your smartphoneThere's another way to listen through headphones, and it doesn't require Bluetooth or wireless headphones. If you install the aforementioned Roku app on your smartphone, then plug a pair of headphones into your phone as well, you can tap Remote control in the app and then the headphone button to stream the audio right to your ears.\n    \n            \n            You can use the mobile app to listen over headphones.\n                                        Credit: Roku\n                    \n    \nMirror your other devices to your RokuApple devices: Roku sticks, boxes and TVs come with support for the Apple AirPlay standard built right in, so you can beam across audio and video from Apple devices, or even mirror your Mac display on the big screen. On the Roku, choose Settings then Apple AirPlay and HomeKit to make sure you're set up, then just select the AirPlay button on your Apple hardware.Android devices: For screen casting, you're not left out if you're on Android, though—as usual with Android—capabilities vary between devices. Samsung Galaxy phones have the smoothest integration: Swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen, choose Smart View, and your Roku should show up as a connection option (if it's on the same wifi network).Windows devices: If you want to mirror your screen to a Roku from Windows, the process is different again. First, enable the feature on the Roku via Settings > System > Screen mirroring. Next, from Windows, click the volume and wifi icons down in the lower right corner, click the Display button, then select your Roku.

I know when I stumble upon a new discovery I love—or even something I think is trash—I fire it off to the group chat to talk about it. Of course, I just forward the song to the group chat in the Messages app, like any other thing I'd want to send to that group. If you have Spotify, however, you have a new group chat option to choose from: Spotify itself. Spotify heads might already know that the app has had a messaging feature since August. While the point of the feature is to send Spotify content to your friends, it's a basic messaging service, which means you can send any text you want—including emojis. It's available to any Spotify user, whether you have Premium or just a free account, so long as you're 16 or older. None of that is new today.What is new today is the amount of people you can text at once in Spotify. Since August, chats have been limited to one-on-one interactions. Now, you're able to add up to nine other people at once to a thread. That means 10-person group chats to talk about new music, podcasts, audiobooks, or, of course, anything at all—assuming you actually want to move your DMs to Spotify.\nHow to start a group chat on SpotifyTo start, open Spotify on mobile (this isn't supported on desktop at this time) then tap your profile in the top right corner. Look for \"Messages\" at the bottom of this menu, then choose \"New Message.\" If this is your first time interacting with people on Spotify, you'll need to invite others to chat before you can craft a new message. Here, you'll have the choice to share a link to invite a friend to join your message. You can also find this option from the share menu on any piece of Spotify content, and hitting the \"Invite friends\" option. Once you've initiated a message, you'll be able to start crafting new ones—including group chats. Head back to this Messages menu—or hit the share button on a song, podcast, or audiobook—then choose \"Create group.\" Here, tap any friends from the suggestions you'd like to add, then choose \"Create group\" again to finalize the chat. Spotify says the people that appear in the list of suggestions are those you have shared content to before, created a playlist or Blend with previously, were in a \"recent\" Jam together, or are on an active Family or Duo plan. If they don't appear, you can always choose the invite option to reach out directly.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhoever creates the group is officially its admin. As the admin, you have the power to add or remove anyone from the group chat. If you're in the group chat, you're labeled as a \"Participant.\" Invited members are labeled \"Pending.\" The admin as well as any participants are allowed to block any group chat user for any reason.The issue is, do you really want to dedicate a group chat to Spotify itself? Maybe if this feature rolled out when the app launched way back when, it'd be different. But people are set in their ways: It's so hard to get people to move chat apps, especially when it's for one specific purpose. Rather than open yet another thread to keep track of, I think I'd rather just text links to my main group chat—and I'm guessing the other members of the chat would agree. How to turn off Spotify MessagesIf you don't want to use Spotify's messaging service at all, you can leave it behind, and save yourself from getting added to all future group and one-on-one chats. To do so, tap your profile, choose \"Settings and privacy,\" then hit \"Privacy and social.\" Here, scroll down to \"Social features\" and turn off \"Messages.\" \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

This deal on a Eufy SoloCam E30 four-pack makes that math a little more palatable. It’s currently $299.99 on Amazon, down from its usual $549.99 price, which is the lowest price it's ever been, according to price-tracking tools. That brings each camera to about $75, which still isn’t cheap, of course—but unlike many other camera brands, these don't require a monthly subscription, which is a great perk.\nEach of these IP65-rated cameras runs on internal batteries that last about three months between charges, depending on how often motion is detected. Solar support helps extend that. Eufy says around two hours of direct sunlight per day is enough to keep them topped up. You can also hardwire the cameras if you want continuous recording, including short pre-roll clips, though the power cables are sold separately. You also get 360-degree pan and 70-degree tilt coverage per unit, which helps cut down on blind spots around driveways or yards. Video is captured in enhanced 2K resolution with an f/1.6 aperture, making nighttime footage via infrared night vision fairly crisp. There’s no built-in spotlight, so there's no color night vision here, but for general monitoring, black-and-white is often enough.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nFootage can be stored locally on the included HomeBase S280, which has 16GB built in, or on a microSD card up to 128GB (sold separately) if you want more space. Smart home support includes Alexa and Google Assistant, but Apple HomeKit is not supported. Two-way audio is included, and the HomeBase can support up to 16 cameras, so expanding later is an option. This setup is not for people who want cloud storage or advanced smart home integrations. It makes more sense for those who want local control, predictable costs, and broad coverage without wiring the entire house.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Right now, the Tapo MagCam 2K+ is on sale for $64.98 on Amazon, down from $89.99, which is its lowest price to date, according to price trackers.\n PCMag named it the best security camera of 2024, pointing out that while battery-powered cameras often trade convenience for frequent recharging, the MagCam 2K+ avoids that issue with a 10,000mAh battery rated to last up to 300 days per charge, depending on how often it records.Charging happens over micro-USB, though there’s an optional Tapo A200 solar panel ($35.99) if you want to avoid manual recharging altogether. Video tops out at 2K resolution, with a wide 150-degree field of view that works well for driveways or side yards. During the day, footage looks sharp and detailed. At night, the camera can switch between infrared black-and-white or color video using its built-in spotlights and starlight sensor. Storage is flexible. You can record locally to a microSD card, up to 512GB (card not included), or you can go with cloud storage through a Tapo Care plan starting at $3.49/month.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAlerts can distinguish between people, pets, and vehicles, and those intelligent notifications are free, as highlighted by PCMag in its “outstanding” review of the MagCam 2K+. It also integrates smoothly with Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT, though it doesn’t support Apple’s HomeKit.

If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message. The healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text. Are you eligible for the Kaiser settlement? To qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow to claim your settlement cashTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12. While the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

The personal AI assistant runs locally and connects via a chat app, like WhatsApp or iMessage. Once you give Moltbot access to your entire device, it can do things on that device for you. This the sort of thing that excites agentic AI pioneers, but worries privacy and security enthusiasts like myself. And indeed, I have significant concerns about the risks installing Moltbot on your personal machine. Since agentic AI will autonomously perform tasks based on prompts, bad actors can take advantage of the situation by surreptitiously feeding those bots malicious prompts of their own. This is called prompt injection, and it can impact any type of agentic AI system, whether an AI browser, or an AI assistant like Moltbot.      But it's not just prompt injection that presents an issue for Moltbot users.\nSomeone has already created a malicious Moltbot extension   As spotted by The Hacker News, Moltbot already has its first malicious extension, dubbed \"Clawdbot Agent - AI Coding Assistant\" (\"clawdbot.clawdbot-agent.\") It seems to have been developed before the bot's name change. This extension is designed for Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's open source AI code editor. What's worse, it was hosted on Microsoft's official Extension Marketplace, which no doubt gave it legitimacy to Moltbot users looking for a Visual Studio Code extension.    The extension advertised itself as a free AI coding assistant. When you install it, it executes a series of commands that ends up running a remote desktop program (The Hacker News says it's \"ConnectWise ScreenConnect\") on your device. It then connects to a link that lets the bad actor gain remote access to your device. By just installing this extension, you essentially give the hacker the tools to take over your computer from wherever they are.   Luckily, Microsoft has already taken action. The extension is no longer available on the marketplace as of Tuesday. Moltbot has no official Visual Studio Code extension, so assume any you see are illegitimate at best, and malicious at worst. If you did install the extension, researchers have detailed instructions for removing the malware and blocingk any of its processes from running on your device. Of course, to first thing to do is uninstall the extension from Visual Studio Code immediately.Moltbolt has more security issues tooThe Hacker News goes on to highlight findings from security researcher Jamieson O'Reilly, who discovered hundreds of unauthenticated Moltbot instances readily available on the internet. These instances reveal Moltbot users' configuration data, API keys, OAuth credentials, and even chat histories. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBad actors could use these instances for prompt injection: They could pretend to be a Moltbot user, and issue their own prompts to that user's Moltbot AI assistant, or manipulate existing prompts and responses. They could also upload malicious \"skills,\" or specific collections of context and knowledge, to MoltHub and use them to attack users and steal their data. Speaking to The Hacker News, security researcher Benjamin Marr explains that the core issue is how Moltbot is designed for \"ease of deployment\" over a \"secure-by-default\" set up. You can poke around with Moltbot and install sensitive programs without the bot ever warning you about the security risks. There should be firewalls, credential validation, and sandboxing in the mix, and without those things, the user is at greater risk.  To combat against this, The Hacker News recommends that all Moltbot users running with the default security configurations take the following steps: remove any connected service integrationscheck exposed credentialsset up network controlslook for any signs of attackOr, you could do what I'm doing, and avoid Moltbot altogether.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It’s selling for $1,698 on Amazon (down from $2,399.99) which is the lowest it’s been so far, according to price trackers. At this size, that discount meaningfully shifts the math, especially if you’re after a large screen from a brand known for dependable processing and a polished smart TV experience, rather than chasing raw specs alone.\nThe Bravia 5 steps is the successor to Sony’s X90L, swapping full-array local dimming for Mini LED backlighting and adding a higher number of dimming zones. It runs Google TV (version 12), supports Dolby Vision, and handles DTS audio passthrough. There’s also a practical perk for Sony soundbar owners: the TV’s built-in speakers can function as a center channel. On the gaming side, two HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K at 120Hz, along with variable refresh rate and G-sync compatibility. That said, Game Mode isn’t flawless. Pixel response times are on the slower side, which can introduce noticeable motion blur, particularly in fast-paced titles. SDR brightness is strong enough for daytime viewing, but HDR output doesn’t deliver the kind of punch you might expect from a Mini LED panel at this size and price.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhere the Bravia 5 struggles most is contrast consistency and viewing flexibility. Despite the upgraded backlight, black levels and overall contrast don’t represent a major leap over the older X90L, and reflections can still be distracting in brighter rooms. The narrow viewing angle also limits its appeal for wide seating layouts. If pure picture performance is the priority, competing Mini LED models from TCL or Hisense, or even some OLED options, offer stronger contrast for similar money. Still, for buyers who value Sony’s processing, Google TV’s clean interface, and long-term brand reliability, this price drop makes the 85-inch Bravia 5 a far more compelling option than it usually is.\n            \n    \n    \n            Shop smarter, save more money\n                Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It's a powerhouse of a browser that is more widely used than any other.In the 18 years since its release, Chrome has changed a lot: A host of features have been added and taken away down the years, and it's very possible that you don't know everything that Chrome can do, even if you use it every day. Here are my favorite hacks for Chrome, covering everything from casting tabs to playing audio and video.Change the look and feel of Google ChromeIf you've always stuck with the 'out of the box' Chrome aesthetic, you might not be aware that it's relatively simple to change up the theme of the browser—which covers the colors of menus and tabs, as well as what you see on the new tab page. To see the available options, open up a new tab, then click the Customize Chrome button (lower right).You can apply any of the color themes just by clicking on them, or set up your own colors by clicking the color picker (the little pipette icon). For a more significant visual overhaul, click Change theme: You'll then see a range of options created and curated by Google. Click Chrome Web Store to see more official and third-party themes you can install.Claw back some RAM from Chrome\n    \n            \n            Activate Memory Saver for smoother performance.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nIt's fair to say Chrome doesn't have the best reputation for efficient RAM usage, but you can get some of it back. In any tab, click the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Performance, and activate the Memory Saver option. As Google explains, this will put tabs you've not used in a while in an inactive state, and recover some RAM from them.Put your tabs up on a big screenIt's not a Chrome feature that gets much attention, but you can cast tabs wireless to a big screen via Google TV or Chromecast devices. It's useful for everything from music streaming to slide presentations, though the latency is usually too high for video playback (and bear in mind that YouTube, for example, has its own casting button for this).With a tab open in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then choose Cast, save and share > Cast. You'll then be asked to choose the device to cast to (which must be on the same wifi network of course). Via the Sources button, you can choose to cast just the tab you're in, or your entire Windows or macOS desktop, including Google Chrome.Switch up your search engine\n    \n            \n            Chrome can use whatever search engine you tell it to.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nJust because you use Google Chrome doesn't mean you have to use Google Search—maybe you want to switch to a privacy-first alternative, like DuckDuckGo. To set up search engines in Chrome and change the default one, click the three dots in the top right corner of any tab, then choose Settings, and open the Search engine page.Use the Add button to add new search engines, the pencil icons on the right to edit their details, and the three dots on the right to set which one is used by default (when you type some search terms into the Chrome address bar). Each search engine can also have a shortcut: Type the shortcut into the address bar to run a search using that specific site.Group your tabs togetherTab grouping can make it much easier to manage the myriad tabs you've got open in every single session—these groups can be moved and closed and saved all together, so you could set up different groups for different research projects, for example, or for different tasks in the browser (maybe one for work-related browsing and another for shopping).The easiest way to get started with tab groups in Chrome is to right click on a tab header and pick Add tab to new group from the pop-up menu. Give your tab a name and color, and if you then right-click on other tab headers, you'll be able to add them to the group (or create a new one). Right-click on the headers of grouped tabs to access further options.Switch between user profiles\n    \n            \n            Add a new profile to separate your browsing activities.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nUser profiles are a hugely powerful Chrome capability that more people should know about: It lets you split your browsing into work and personal categories, for example, (and separate Google accounts, if needed). It means that logins, browsing history, and all the other data that gets stored in Chrome don't all get lumped together in one place.So, you could use your work profile for the day, and then switch to your personal profile at night—making it easier to access your Netflix login and Amazon shopping history, for example. To get started with profiles, click your current profile avatar (in the top right corner, next to the three dots), then choose Add Chrome profile from the menu.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nEdit webpages with TampermonkeyIf you're prepared to invest some time and effort into your Chrome hacking, give the Tampermonkey extension a look (it's actually available for several browsers, not just Chrome). The tool lets you inject your own custom code to modify the websites you're looking at, so you can alter the appearance or even the functionality of pages.You could remove distractions from a page, for example, add your own keyboard shortcuts for navigation, or insert new buttons for sharing links on social media. We don't have the space for a full tutorial here, but if you head to the Tampermonkey website you'll find a wealth of help to get you started, plus some links to user script repositories on the web.Install web apps in Windows or macOS\n    \n            \n            Spotify's web app as a desktop app.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nThere are plenty of powerful web apps you can get at through Chrome—Slack, Gmail, Spotify—and Google's browser lets you set these up as if they were desktop apps in Windows or macOS. You can get a shortcut straight to the app on the Windows taskbar or macOS dock, and when you launch it, it appears in its own distinct desktop window.With the web app open in Chrome, click the three dots (top right), then choose Cast, save and share > Install page as app. You'll then be asked to give your new app a name, and click Install to confirm. The app launches right away, and you can then organize it into your Windows or macOS system as you want (by pinning it to the taskbar, for example).Run a check for safety and privacyChrome comes with a built-in Safety Check that runs an audit on passwords, security updates, third-party extensions, and more. You can find the Safety Check screen by clicking the three dots to the top right of any tab, then choosing Settings > Privacy and security: As well as running the check, you can follow the recommended actions.\n    \n            \n            Chrome can quickly open files like PDFs.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nGoogle Chrome can handle more than webpages: It's also able to open up PDF documents, and image, video, and audio files saved in common formats (like MP3 or MOV). Just drag a file into an empty tab to open it, or associate the file type with Chrome in Windows or macOS (which means it'll automatically open in the browser when you double-click on it).Chrome isn't the most advanced PDF editor or video player you're ever going to see, but it's a quick and easy way of opening up local files without having to launch an entirely separate program each time. You could use this alongside the Split View feature, for example, to watch a video stored on your system while making notes in Google Docs.\n            \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n                        \n                \n            \n                    \n                                            \n                \n            \n                David Nield\n                                \n                                            David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. \n                                    \n                Read David's full bio\n                            \n        \n                \n                                            \n    More by David\n        \n        \n                        \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n                                    \n                                            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        \n        Before you head out to a protest, take some precautions to protect your privacy and both the physical and digital security of any device you bring along. The most secure option, of course, is to leave your phone at home, but you can also lock things down to minimize the risk that your data will be accessible to law enforcement or someone who gets hold of your device. Thankfully, both iOS and Android have built-in device encryption if you're using a passcode, meaning that your device's data cannot be accessed when it is locked. (On Android, go to Settings > Security to ensure Encrypt Disk is enabled). You'll want to maximize this protection with the following privacy settings. Turn off face and fingerprint scanningAt an absolute minimum, you'll want to disable biometric access, such as face and fingerprint authentication, on your device in favor of a passcode or PIN. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, this minimizes the risk of being physically forced to unlock your device and may provide stronger legal protections against compelled decryption. \nOn iOS, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off iPhone Unlock. You can also set up a stronger passcode—a custom numeric or alphanumeric code—under Change Passcode. On Android, you'll find the option to delete your fingerprint in favor of your PIN or screen lock pattern under Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Fingerprint.Limit location trackingAgain, the best option to prevent your location from being tracked is to coordinate any details in advance and leave your phone at home. If you must bring it along, keep it off unless you absolutely need to use it. You can turn on Airplane Mode in advance, as well as disable Bluetooth, wifi, and location services, which keeps your device from transmitting your location. However, note that some apps may still be able to store GPS data and transmit it when an internet connection is available—so again, the safest bet is to keep your device off for the duration. Airplane Mode can be enabled (and wifi and Bluetooth disabled) in your device's settings or quick access menu. On Android, go to Settings > Location to disable location services and turn off Location History in your Google account. On iOS, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services to disable locations entirely. Turn off previews and notificationsTemporarily disable notifications and screen previews so that if someone gets your device, they won't be able to glean any information from your lock screen. You can adjust these options under Settings > Notifications on iOS and Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications on Android. Adjust screen lock timeMinimize your screen lock time to as short a period as possible so that your screen turns off when you're not actively using it and will require authentication to reopen. On iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and select 30 seconds. The exact path on Android may vary, but typically you'll find this under Settings > Display or Lock Screen. Know that most devices have camera access from the lock screen, so you can take photos or record video without actually unlocking your device. Enable app pinning or Guided AccessApp pinning (Android) and Guided Access (iOS) are features that prevent others from navigating through your phone beyond a specific app or screen. This allows you to use an essential feature on your device while locking the rest behind your PIN or passcode. You can enable this preemptively, and if someone grabs your device, they won't be able to snoop around. You can find this setting on Android under Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and on iOS under Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nUse a SIM PINYou can also lock your SIM card to prevent unauthorized use of your device or SIM card, including access to two-factor authentication codes sent via SMS. This PIN will be required any time your phone restarts or if someone tries to use your SIM card in another device. On iOS, go to Settings > Cellular, select your SIM, and tap SIM PIN. On Android, you'll find this under Settings > Security > More security settings (the exact path varies by device). Sign out of, hide, or delete appsThis step will vary depending on what you keep on your phone and your risk tolerance, but you may want to consider signing out of your social media accounts and deleting apps that contain or allow access to sensitive data. On iOS, you can also lock or hide specific apps: the former requires an extra authentication step to open apps on your home screen, while the latter sends apps to a hidden folder that also requires authentication to unlock. Touch and hold an app icon to bring up the quick actions menu, then tap Require Face ID/Require Passcode.  On Android, you can set up a \"private space\" to lock apps behind your pattern, PIN, or password. Apps are hidden from the launcher and recent views as well as quick search. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > Private space, authenticate with your screen lock, and tap Set up > Got it. If necessary, turn on Lockdown Mode or Advanced ProtectionBoth iOS and Android have strict device-level security modes that significantly limit access to certain app and web features as well as blocking changes to settings. Both were designed with journalists, activists, and other users with access to sensitive data that may be targeted by cyber actors in mind. These settings are overkill for day-to-day use but add a potentially helpful layer of security in high-risk situations. Enable Lockdown Mode on iOS via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. On Android, turn on Advanced Protection under Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.Protect your privacy after a protestWhile the above steps are largely about securing your data during a protest, you should also follow best practices for protecting privacy (yours and others') after the fact. If you plan to post photos or videos, utilize blurring tools to block faces and other unique identifying features, and scrub file metadata, which includes information like photo location. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the image to post or sending a copy to yourself in Signal, which automatically strips metadata. Signal also has a photo blurring tool, or you can blur in your device's default photo editing app. \n            ",

Way too many applications want to put icons in the top-right corner of the screen, and most users only want to see a fraction of those. This is a particular problem on recent MacBooks, where the camera notch blacks out a chunk of space right in the middle of the menu bar. This is why applications for cleaning up the Mac menu bar are so popular—the clutter can feel overwhelming.Here's the thing, though: You probably don't need to leave applications like that running constantly. You can hide icons in macOS' Settings, then use a free tool once to move all the icons closer together. Here's how.How to hide icons in Mac System SettingsTahoe, also known as macOS 26, gave users a lot to talk about, which meant a few features were broadly overlooked. One of them: the ability to hide any menu bar icon, no third party software required. To use this feature open System Settings and head to the Menu Bar section. You will see the ability to toggle system icons, like Siri and Spotlight, on and off. Keep scrolling, though, and you'll find the ability to hide icons for any of your installed applications. Just toggle off any application you'd rather not see in the menu bar and it will disappear.\nI've been using this to disable unwanted icons for months, and it's working well for me. Having said that, though, it isn't a perfect replacement. Applications like Bartender and Ice don't just hide icons—they give you access to a secondary tray where you can still occasionally access icons you hid. There's no quick way to do that using the macOS settings. Still: It's a free way to hide unwanted icons, and there's no need to keep third party software running.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nIf your menu bar still feels crowded, you can free up a bit more space by squeezing all of your icons together. A free application called Menu Bar Spacing lets you change the spacing in your menu bar. Just download the application, move the slider, and your icons will move closer together.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe great thing about Menu Bar Spacing, as an application, is that it doesn't need to run constantly. You can launch it once, make the changes you like, and then delete it—your setting will still apply. This is because the application changes a few hidden macOS settings. You can make the changes yourself using the Terminal if you prefer not to use an app, but I think the app makes things a little bit easier.There's a bit of a caveat for macOS 26 users. Because of a bug, only Apple's own icons will move closer together at first. Your other applications will need to be restarted before they bunch closer together. That means you'll need to manually close and re-launch each application, or simply restart your Mac. It's annoying, but only relevant right after you change the settings. And you'll have a lot more space on your menu bar once you're done.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Route navigation on Strava-compatible watches isn't exactly new technology—it's just been inexplicably absent from Apple's platform until now. In a Reddit post from Strava's product team, the news was welcomed by runners, cyclists, and hikers who've long wondered why their Apple Watch couldn't do what Garmin and Coros devices have offered for years. What's new with Strava's Apple Watch appThe core update here is users can now view maps directly on their Apple Watch during activities, seeing both where they're headed and how to backtrack if they take a wrong turn. For subscribers, saved Routes work hands-free and function offline, eliminating the need to pull out your phone mid-run or mid-ride to check directions.To access routes directly on your watch, press the Route icon while selecting the Sport Type that you’ll record.  Once you’ve selected the saved route you want to follow, the activity will start recording. \nTo then access the map while in the middle of recording your activity, simply swipe up on your watch face. Once on the map screen, you will be able to follow your live location and, if added, your saved route. To zoom or pan the map, tap the watch face to unlock interactive mode. If you want to turn back to your Stat screen, tap the back icon or use the watch scroll button.Alongside route navigation, Strava added two more training features:\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nCustom Laps let you mark intervals with a single tap, useful for tempo runs, hill repeats, or comparing efforts against your previous performances. Live Segments provide real-time feedback when you hit a tracked segment. Subscribers can see whether they're ahead or behind their personal record as it happens, while all users get live progress updates. As always, you can also turn to route suggestions that draw from Strava's massive activity database full of actual paths that real users have tested and preferred.The bottom lineFor Apple Watch users who've grown accustomed to working around Strava's limitations, this update rocks. Less phone checking means more attention on the road, trail, or effort itself. Maybe it's taken longer than it should have, but Apple Watch users are finally caught up. Whether that's enough to satisfy those who've already migrated to other platforms remains to be seen, but for the loyal holdouts, it's about time.\n            \n    \n    \n            Ready to do everything better?\n                Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from our expert team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

Reports started as early as last September and gained traction last week, and now, Google has removed the feature on some older phones.Called \"Take a Message,\" the buggy feature was released last year and is supposed to automatically transcribe voicemails as they're coming in, as well as detect and mark spam calls. Unfortunately, according to reports from multiple users on Reddit (as initially spotted by 9to5Google), the feature has started turning on the microphone while taking voicemails, allowing whoever is leaving you a voicemail to hear you. Audio leaks are bad in any circumstance, but they must feel especially nasty if you're trying to pretend you're not there.Affected users have have found that while the caller can hear the audio from the person receiving the voicemail, there's no indication on the receiver's end that their audio can be heard, aside from the green microphone indicator possibly turning on.\nThe issue has been reported affecting Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 4 to the Pixel 10, and on a recent support page, Google's finally acknowledging it. However, the company's action might not be enough, depending on how cautious you want to be.According to Community Manager Siri Tejaswini, the company has \"investigated this issue,\" and has confirmed it \"affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and 5 devices under very specific and rare circumstances.\" The post doesn't go any further on the how and why of the diagnosis, but says that Google is now disabling Take a Message and \"next-gen Call Screen features\" on these devices.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nNext-gen Call Screen is a separate feature that allows Google's AI to ask a caller their name and the purpose of their call before taking a message. No bugs have been reported for it, but Google says it's disabling both features out of \"an abundance of caution.\"While this should prevent the issue from popping up for users with those phones, it's a bit of a heavy-handed fix. I've reached out to Google to check if Take a Message is only being removed temporarily while the company fixes the bug, or if it will now be permanently gone. In the meantime, Tejaswini does say that Pixel 4 and 5 owners will still be able to use manual and automatic Call Screening, which provide basic protection against spam. The post also suggests that affected users can rely on any call screening features provided by their cellular carriers.How to disable Take a Message on your Pixel phoneWhile it's encouraging that Google is taking action on the Take a Message bug, the company only seems to be acknowledging it for Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 models, at least for now. I've asked Google whether owners of other Pixel models should be worried, as user reports seem split on this. Still, because some have mentioned an issue with even the most up-to-date Pixel phone, if you want to practice your own abundance of caution, it might be worth disabling Take a Message on your device, regardless of its model number.To do this, open your Phone app, then tap the three-lined menu icon at the top-left of the page. Navigate to Settings > Call Assist > Take a Message, and toggle the feature off.\n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It seems I can't open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube without running smack into bizarre and troubling AI concoctions featuring babies in danger and cats having affairs. It really is the wild west (or maybe Westworld) out there. I think few among us really believe these videos are any good, and it's pretty obvious they aren't good for us, or for the world. Short-form video is already numbing enough, but this AI content is generally completely devoid of any meaning or substance. And yet, it's everywhere. I haven't spent too much time on YouTube Shorts recently, but in my limited experience, the feed has been chock full of AI, especially if I'm logged out of my personal account.Still, if you're a dedicated YouTube Shorts user (or a frequent YouTube user in general) you might have noticed something odd in recent days: There don't seem to be quite as many AI videos on the platform right now. There are still a lot, don't get me wrong, but it turns out YouTube has recently taken action to remove some of its AI content—the sloppiest of the slop. \nYouTube's war on AI slopAndroid Police spotted the development on Wednesday, basing its findings on a November report from Kapwing, a company that develops an online video editor. Kapwing investigated AI slop across YouTube's vast content library, noting the top 100 most-subscribed YouTube channels that publish this sort of AI content. In the two months since that report, Android Police noticed that 16 of those 100 channels are no longer with us.That includes the most popular AI channel on YouTube, at least according to Kapwing. \"CuentosFacianantes\" had 5.95 million subscribers at the time of their initial report, and produced AI-generated shorts inspired by Dragon Ball. The channel had amassed roughly 1.28 billion views by the end of last year; despite launching in 2020, it had curated its library to begin Jan. 8, 2025, so those numbers were racked up pretty recently. The number two channel, \"Imperio de Jesus\" with 5.87 million subscribers, and the number seven channel \"Super Cat League,\" with 4.21 million subscribers, were also shut down. According to Android Police, the 16 channels in question had a total of 35 million subscribers and over 4.7 billion views across their collective videos. Some of these channels are completely gone, while others simply have had their videos removed. Why is YouTube removing AI slop?YouTube CEO Neal Mohan published a post on Jan. 21 of this year describing the company's vision for 2026. Towards the end of that letter, he acknowledges AI content, predicting that, \"AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" and comparing it to tools like Photoshop and CGI, adding \"AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.\" However, Mohan was also critical of the technology, noting that it's becoming more difficult to tell real videos from AI. He notes that YouTube is now removing \"any harmful synthetic media that violates our Community Guidelines,\" and is giving creators tools to help identify and block deepfakes. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nMore interestingly, the letter includes a section labeled \"Managing AI slop,\" which is the first time I've seen a company like YouTube use that expression. Mohan says that YouTube's goal is to be a place where free expression thrives, but also a place \"where people feel good spending their time.\" To that point, he says, \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.\"Mohan doesn't call out any accounts by name, nor does he acknowledge the accounts and content the company has already deleted, but it's a clear line in the sand: YouTube is not against AI-generated content, but it will remove low-quality AI content it feels is, well, slop. That's good news for anyone who uses YouTube (so, pretty much everyone), even if it's far from a cure for the growing problem.I've reached out to YouTube for comment on this story, and will update this piece if I hear back. \n            \n    \n    \n            Never miss a tech story\n                Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n            \n        \n    ",

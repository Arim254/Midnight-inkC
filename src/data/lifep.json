    "body": "\n        \n        Contactless payment, also known as tap-to-pay, has become a fast, easy, and relatively common way to complete a transaction using your smartphone or credit card. It relies on Near Field Communication (NFC) to transmit data between your device and a payment terminal when the two are in close proximity, up to an inch or two away.While NFC technology does provide some additional security—transmitting a virtual account number instead of your actual card details, for example—scammers have found a way to capitalize on tap-to-pay to steal money from unsuspecting targets. These \"ghost tapping\" schemes may exploit both cards and mobile wallets. How tap-to-pay scams workAccording to the Better Business Bureau, ghost tapping takes advantage of a potential victim's proximity and lack of attention to detail. They suggest it is possible for a scammer to bump into you in a crowded public space, getting close enough to trigger a contactless transaction without your knowledge. (It's not clear how common a close brush with a tap-to-pay machine actually is.) \nBut other versions of ghost tapping rely on you to actively engage while missing the warning signs of fraud. For example, scammers might appear to be selling goods or collecting small donations for charity using tap-to-pay, but they are actually charging your card for a much larger amount to a fraudulent business. They count on you not to look closely at the transaction details before tapping, or they rush you through the process and fail to offer a receipt.  In one instance reported to the BBB's Scam Tracker, individuals were targeted by a door-to-door salesman who claimed to be selling chocolate for a charitable cause. The transactions were for hundreds of dollars, which the victims didn't see before tapping. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nAs with any scam, vigilance is key. Tap-to-pay is easy enough to feel automatic, and you may be less likely to pause and check the details than you would when swiping or entering your credit card. Always slow down and confirm the merchant name and transaction and tip amount before pulling out your phone or card (again, close proximity is enough to trigger tap-to-pay). Beware of any vendor who tries to rush you, hide the screen, or avoid giving you a receipt. You may also want to set up transaction alerts with your bank or credit card company so you can catch any suspicious charges immediately. If you get a notification about a \"test\" charge, that is also a scam red flag. Finally, while scammers probably aren't going around secretly scanning tap-to-pay en masse, you could protect your cards using a radio frequency identification (RFID)-blocking wallet or sleeve. You can disable NFC on your Android in Settings (type \"NFC\" into the search bar). On iPhone, you have to turn on Airplane Mode to block NFC. \n            ",

It was a clever way of ensuring than your iPhone didn't unlock in your pocket, or due to an accidental touch. With iOS 10, Apple killed slide to unlock in favor of pressing the Home button, then later swiping up on the bottom of the screen. Since then, for the better part of a decade, swiping right on the Lock Screen simply takes you to the \"Today View,\" which contains your widgets. Change is good, and I don't necessarily think Apple should bring back slide to unlock for the Lock Screen, but sometimes, I miss how things worked on my old iPhone 3GS. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. To my absolute surprise, however, the company is bringing back the slide function—just not to unlock. Instead, you're now able to slide to stop your alarms, which might come as a surprise to anyone used to the usual alarm routine. Imagine it: One morning, you're tapping to turn off your alarm as usual; the next, your taps are fruitless, and your alarm keeps blaring. Bleary-eyed, you look at your screen, to find a new \"Slide to stop\" function. If you're like me, you'll follow instructions, sliding to stop the alarm, only to forget the whole ordeal within moments, doomed to repeat the affair the next morning. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis change arrives as part of iOS 26.1, which dropped on Monday, and Apple doesn't give you any say in the matter—at least, not at first. After updating to the latest update, your next alarm or timer will include the next slider (though \"snooze\" or \"repeat\" remain buttons), but the switch up is fine by me. I like it, and it brings back a fun feature from iOS' heyday. But if you dislike the change, and you wish you could simply tap a button to silence your alarms and timers, the good news is, you still can. How to disable \"slide to stop alarm\"Apple buried the option to revert your alarm and timers back to the way they used to be, so I wouldn't blame you for not knowing they even exist. You won't find them in the Clock app's settings page, which is confusing. Instead, it's part of a hidden system-wide setting, called \"Prefer Single-Touch Actions.\"  This setting will disable sliders across iOS, and replace them with buttons. For our purposes, that turns \"Slide to stop\" back into a simple off button. To find it, head to Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then enable the toggle next to \"Prefer Single-Touch Action.\" \n    \n            \n            Slide to stop (left) vs. stop button (right).\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, as far as I'm concerned. From where I'm sitting, many of us couldn't care less about the latest AI features companies are shoving into their products—we just want the products we actually use to work, and work well. But strictly focusing on AI progress, Apple is far behind rivals like Google and Microsoft. While Android and Windows are full of AI features, either through Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT models, Apple's first-party AI advances are much more limited. Both Google and Microsoft promote their AI assistants as a cornerstone of their marketing strategies; meanwhile, Apple pulled it AI Siri commercial, as its promised upgrades kept getting delayed.That's not to say there aren't any AI features here—far from it. Since iOS 18, Apple has rolled out AI features under the Apple Intelligence umbrella, including things like Image Playground, AI image editing, and Writing Tools. But, again, these features are not selling iPhones, and it seems like Apple knows it. The company appears to be doing more AI work behind the scenes than in front of it these days.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDespite all this, the company is still making serious in-roads with AI. In fact, the company is planning three key new AI features, at least according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.AI SiriRemember how I said Apple's AI Siri upgrade keeps getting delayed? Well, as it happens, AI Siri might be here sooner than later—at least, in part. According to Gurman, Apple plans to roll out \"a new Siri\" with iOS 26.4, while the assistant will get a \"redesign\" with next year's iOS 27. If you recall, Apple promised an AI-powered Siri with iOS 18 that was smarter than any iteration of Siri that had come before. This AI Siri was highly contextual, understanding what you meant in your requests without you needing to be hyper-specific. In addition, the assistant could pull information from a variety of sources, such as messages or emails, to fulfill requests, and even had an agent mode to take actions on your behalf. This is similar to how AI browsers let you ask the assistant to do things on the web for you. It's objectively futuristic, to be sure, but not necessarily useful—nor is it secure.As it happens, Apple had a lot of trouble actually getting those features to work. The company's new Siri is an extreme engineering puzzle that wasn't solved by iOS 18's release, and was delayed through iOS 26.0. If the schedule holds, those changes should be coming to 26.4, and may even be powered in part by Google's Gemini model. That said, iOS 26.4 is likely four months away: Apple just released iOS 26.1 and is beta testing iOS 26.2, and neither update comes with any Siri upgrades. Since the company released iOS 18.4 in March of this year, chances are we'll see 26.4 in March 2026. If so, we might only be a quarter year away from a new Siri experience. Next year, according to Gurman, Siri will get a total makeover. The assistant will be more conversational, and will power Apple's upcoming smart home device strategy. But that's a ways away yet.AI health agent Gurman says Apple is also working on an AI agent that can coach users on health-related issues. Codenamed \"Project Mulberry,\" the service combines a new Health app, subscription (Health+), and AI health assistant. This assistant can pull data from the Health app to inform its advice, and is being trained using real doctors across medical professions. According to Gurman, \"if the Health app receives data about poor heart-rate trends, a video explaining the risks of heart disease could appear.\"The company is actually opening studio space to record videos for this service, and may feature a \"major doctor personality\" to \"host\" this Health+ service. (My money's on Doctor Mike, but maybe that's the only major doctor personality I know.)Gurman says this AI health agent could arrive as soon as iOS 26.4, alongside the new AI Siri. It will be interesting to see how Apple squares two key problems with this feature: AI sometimes makes mistakes (and sometimes just makes things up), so trusting it to offer health advice raises some red flags. Add in the fact that Apple will be using user data to inform the AI on how to handle health advice, and user privacy questions pop up. The company prides itself on privacy, so I imagine it will have a clear plan here, but if this AI health agent really launches, these points will need to be addressed. Web search toolFinally, Gurman says that Apple has \"plans for an AI-powered web search tool.\" This tool is called \"World Knowledge Answers\" within the company, and is intended to compete against similar search tools from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity. World Knowledge Answers will integrate directly within Siri, and may come to Safari and Spotlight too. It may include text, images, videos, and \"local points of interest,\" as well as AI summaries. The idea is to keep users asking questions within Apple's own suite of products, rather than see them use other AI search tools. It's likely it'll arrive alongside these other two features with iOS 26.4.Will these AI features be enough to catch Apple up to the rest of the AI players? I'm not sure. But I'm not sure the company needs to catch up. As much as Microsoft has made AI a cornerstone of its new Windows experiences, it's not the reason people are buying PCs. Similarly, few users are choosing their smartphones, tablets, and computers based on whether Apple, Google, or Microsoft has the best AI assistant, or the best array of AI features. AI might be big money right now, but not in a way where Apple needs to be on top to remain one of the biggest companies in the world. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Who are we to argue?\n    \n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        November 7, 2025\n                    \n            Credit: TippaPatt/Shutterstock \n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        How you allocate and use your time every day is as important to productivity as the work you actually do, which is why it's important to pre-plan your schedule down to the minute. You have to be smart and strategic about when you work, what you work on, and how long you do it—otherwise, some of your time may be wasted. Illich’s Law, or the Law of Diminishing Returns, says that after working for a while, your productivity decreases—then becomes negative. What does Illich’s Law mean?We often think of being productive as getting a lot done, but productivity can—and should—also focus on the quality of that work, too. Some good work is, in most cases, better than a lot of shoddy work. Illich’s Law, conceptualized by philosopher and social critic Ivan Illich, suggests that not only does your productivity decrease after you’ve spent too much time on something, but it gets counterproductive. The work you produce after being at it too long could actually be straight-up bad—you shouldn’t have even done it in the first place. Often, you'll end up redoing it, which wastes time you could be spending on other pursuits and makes you less productive.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow to defeat Illich’s LawTo prevent a decline in your work, you need a strategy. First, use time-tracking software or a simple spreadsheet for a week or two to figure out how much time you spend on your typical tasks. Make sure to take notes on when you feel yourself becoming fatigued, bored, or less productive. As always, use timeboxing to structure your calendar, giving every task its own entry and defining timelines through the day. Stick to those timelines rigidly and stop working when your allotted time is up unless you absolutely have to keep going (which shouldn't happen often if you're planning well enough).After you’ve collected some data, assess the time you give yourself to do things. Try reducing the time allotment for each task, so you stop before that bored or unproductive feeling kicks in. Don’t be afraid you’re giving yourself “too little” time, either: The Yerkes-Dodson Law says that your peak of productivity comes when you have just the right amount of stress. Having less time to do something will not only make you more productive under Illich’s Law, but Yerkes-Dodson and Parkinson’s Law, which says you’ll over-complicate work if you have too long to attend to it. Basically, a bunch of major theorists all agree one one thing for various reasons: Working on anything for too long just ain’t it. Once you’ve reduced how much time you’re giving yourself to do things, return to your calendar, which has your timeboxes in it. Change the timing parameters for each entry to your new allotments. This will leave you with small breaks visible in the calendar throughout the day. Schedule breaks in there. The second thing Illich’s law emphasizes is that people need breaks in addition to a reduction in work on specific tasks. Don’t just give yourself less time for each task and move from one to another faster; take breaks in between. This should end up mirroring the Pomodoro technique, or at least approximating it. With Pomodoro, you work for 25 minutes, take a five-minute break, get back to it for 25 more, and keep cycling that way until you've done it four times and earn a larger break. That timing doesn't work for everyone, so feel free to modify the work blocks and break blocks, but keep in mind that your work needs to be followed by at least a little downtime. In general, your productivity needs more breaks, so give yourself a scheduled time to go grab a coffee, scroll social media, or make a personal call. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        Having previously been tested as an experimental flag, Google Chrome's Split View feature is now rolling out in the stable version of the browser (version 142). It doesn't seem to be live for everyone at the same time, but some people are seeing it. (I've got it in Chrome on my Mac, but not yet on Windows.) To check you're on the latest version of Chrome, click the three dots (top right) in a browser tab, then choose Settings and About Chrome. If an update is available, it'll be downloaded, and you can restart your browser to apply it.If you're running the latest version of Chrome and still don't see Split View, you can either wait for the feature to reach you or switch the flag on. Type \"chrome://flags/#side-by-side\" into your browser address bar and hit Enter, then enable the feature and restart your browser. You should then have Split View.\nIt works exactly as you might guess from the name: Split View enables you to have two sites or apps open in the same tab, so you can, for example, dive deep into a Lifehacker article while also keeping an eye on social media. It works much better than just having two Chrome windows up side-by-side in Windows or macOS.How to create a Split ViewThere are a couple of ways to create a Split View. One is to right-click on a tab header and then choose Add tab to new split view from the menu that pops up: The selected tab takes up one half of the Chrome window, and in the other half you can choose another open tab (if there aren't any other open tabs, you'll see the New Tab page).The other method is to click and drag an open tab (using its header), or a web link, to the far left or far right of another tab—you should then see a small space open, with a Create split view label. Getting the dragging and positioning right can take a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty straightforward.\n    \n            \n            Look for a new Split View feature in Chrome.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAfter that, the split tab works more or less like any other normal tab. You can drag it into a different position or into a different window, and you can right-click on it to access the tab options (for muting or pinning, for example). The split view tab will have two small \"x\" icons on it, for closing either half of the tab separately—to close them both, right-click on the tab and choose Close.Whenever you're in a split tab, you'll see a new icon on the Chrome toolbar, which you can click to access related features: You can separate the two views, close the left or the right view, or swap the views over from this toolbar button. The same options are available if you right-click on the Split View tab header.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nHow you can use Split ViewSplit view can help any time you need two webpages or web apps on screen at once. One of Google's own suggestions is keeping a document open while you're on a video call, so you can make notes more easily.It's going to work well for any kind of research or note-taking where you're looking something up and then having to write about it. It may also be less than ideal for our attention spans, because you can load up a video on one half of your Split View, and then scroll through social media on the other half.\n    \n            \n            Two sites open in Split View.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nYou can adjust the sizes of each pane by dragging the divider in the middle, though you are limited overall by the size of the Chrome window. You're also able to switch to different websites within a Split View by typing into the address bar as normal—just make sure you've selected the right half of the pane first.The same sort of effect has long been possible in Windows and macOS by snapping two Chrome windows to each side of the screen, but there's something more convenient and straightforward about having two pages up in the same tab. I can see this being something I make use of a lot, especially on an ultrawide monitor.\n            ",

The portable machine is not strictly playing them all by itself, and you do need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to do it, but the latest system update brings the PlayStation Portal a lot closer to being a true PSP successor.The news came earlier today via the official PlayStation blog, where Sony announced that cloud streaming for the PS Portal will soon officially go live for everyone with a compatible subscription, a little less than a year after the company started testing it with an optional beta. That means that the device can finally live untethered from a console, without any additional setup.It's a breath of fresh air for the Portal, which, when it launched back in 2023, garnered negative reviews for its limited power and portability. While previous Sony handhelds like the PSP and PS Vita were able to play games on their own, disconnected from the internet, at launch the PS Portal could only play games by remotely connecting to a PS5—something gamers could already do on other devices like mobile phones.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThat severely limited the device's usefulness, essentially turning it into an accessory rather than its own console. After today's update, it still needs an internet connection, but the handheld is a lot more useful as a standalone experience.How to cloud game on the PlayStation Portal\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Sony\n                    \n    \nStarting at 6 p.m. PT today, Nov. 5, Sony will start pushing the update live. Once it hits your device, you should see a new UI that, if you weren't in the beta already, will add the option to select a cloud icon to the device's top-left corner. Click through, and as long as you have a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription, you'll be taken to a brand new menu (new even to beta users) that shows all cloud-compatible games, either from games you own or from the PlayStation Plus library. Choose one, and you'll connect directly to Sony's servers, where you can start playing without getting your home console involved.It's not a perfect solution, but Sony advertises it as a way to play its games \"even when your PS5 console back home is powered off or is in use by another account.\" Personally, I'd also like to point out that you could now technically buy a Portal and not get a PS5, instead playing only through the cloud rather than using a console and remote play. At $200, the Portal is less than half the cost of a PS5, so it would save you a decent amount of upfront cost.Still not a perfect handheld solutionThat said, there are still drawbacks. While a cloud connection frees you from having to connect to a PS5 for remote play, it still won't allow you to play in areas without reliable high-speed internet, like on an airplane. It also risks introducing input lag into your gameplay, which means it's not a great choice for competitive titles. Visuals also might appear compressed, depending on your internet speed, and only certain titles are available via the cloud (although hundreds of games are already compatible).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe biggest caveat, though, is the required PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. That'll run you $18/month. It's up to you whether that's worth it over connecting to a console via remote play.On the plus side, Sony promises that it has improved support for public wifi on the Portal, which should make for a smoother experience when playing in a coffee shop or at a hotel. Cloud gaming also now comes with access to features that weren't available during the beta, like in-game purchases, multiplayer invites, and new accessibility options like a screen reader. Outside of cloud gaming, the new update also adds 3D audio support to the PS Portal as a whole, so long as you're using wired headphones or Sony's own Pulse earbuds or headset.It's definitely still a stopgap when compared to an entirely standalone device that can play its own games instead of streaming them (like the Nintendo Switch 2), but if you're a Sony gamer who misses being able to play on the go,  the PS Portal should now be able to bring back some of those fond PSP memories—as long as you're in a spot with good wifi.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "\n        \n        As a tech journalist, I've got Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS devices at home—not because I'm especially wealthy, but because I need to write about all of these platforms, all of the time—and it's my trusty Chromebook that I find myself turning to more often than not.The usual argument against Chromebooks is that they're just a Chrome browser: Windows and macOS give you the same Chrome browser, and much more besides. However, sometimes less is more, as I'll get to below. Sadly, it seems Google is less keen on Chromebooks than I am. The last Google-made Pixelbook launched in 2019, and it's been left to the likes of Asus, Acer, HP, Samsung, and others to keep new Chromebooks coming in. If you're reading, Google, it's high time we had a new Pixelbook.\nChromebooks cut down on the clutterThere is the argument that Windows and macOS give you the Chrome browser plus a lot more, but most of the time, I don't really need the \"more\"—unless I've got some detailed image edits to do, or want to play some games. Almost everything I need runs on the web.There are a lot fewer software updates, background programs, app assistants, and system utilities to think about. While ChromeOS does have updates, they're mostly done seamlessly in the background, and applied whenever you next reboot your Chromebook.Another chore I don't have to regularly take care of on my Chromebook is tidying up the desktop or my local folders, because there isn't really anything to download, save, or sync. The laptop file system and internal storage is tidier by default, because I never use it.Chromebooks save everything instantly\n    \n            \n            No save button required.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAll the work I do on my Chromebook is inside a browser, and usually inside Google apps like Google Docs and Gmail. That means everything is instantly saved—should a power cut or a system crash happen, I don't have to worry about losing what I've been working on.I don't need to check for open programs and files in the background that I might have forgotten about, and if I need to jump up and do something else quickly, I can just shut my laptop and I'm done—I'm not clicking through dozens of save dialogs first.Chromebooks put everything on the webWhen you're working inside web apps all the time, without the option of locally installed tools, syncing is seamless. To work on a document that I need to access across Windows and macOS, for example, I need to think about saving, syncing, and app compatibility.When I'm working in Google Docs in a Chromebook, everything syncs automatically. I can even have a document open simultaneously across ChromeOS, Windows, and macOS, and jump between them as needed to make edits—something which saves a lot of time.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nChromebooks tie in tightly to the Google ecosystem\n    \n            \n            Android phones and Chromebooks play nicely together.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nI can understand that Chromebooks may have less appeal if you're not always using Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Google Docs, Chrome, and everything else Google makes—but for someone heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (like me), they make a lot of sense.If you've got an Android phone, for example, you can use it to set up a Chromebook, share files across both devices, respond to text messages from ChromeOS, and get hotspot access with a click. There's a level of integration you don't get on other platforms.Chromebooks actually work as distraction-free devicesOne of the criticisms leveled at Chromebooks is that they're pretty much useless without an internet connection, but that's only partly true. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and even Gmail actually work perfectly well offline now.If I'm traveling without steady wifi, I enjoy using my Chromebook as a distraction-free device, getting through a ton of writing and email replying without constantly switching tabs. When wifi returns, everything I've done gets synced back to the web automatically. While we're on the subject of ChromeOS being useless when it's not online, I think it's fair to say internet access is almost ubiquitous now (via public wifi or phone hotspots), and that Windows and macOS aren't particularly useful either when the web is cut off.\n            ",

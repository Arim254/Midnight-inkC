We should listen to them.\n    \n        \n    \n                                        \n        \n        \n        November 10, 2025\n                    \n            Credit: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock\n                            \n    Table of Contents\n    \n        \n        Your personal productivity may be dependent on your unique needs, personality, and circumstances, but there are still general “laws” governing time management and potential output that apply to pretty much everyone—like, actual \"laws\" named after the people who came up with them. Economists, philosophers, and scientists have spent a lot of their own time researching what practices make a person more productive. Here’s an overview of the rules all that research has given us. The Yerkes-Dodson LawThe Yerkes-Dodson Law says a person is most productive when they have just the right amount of stress pushing them—not too much and not too little. It models the relationship between stress levels and performance, resulting in an upside-down, U-shaped curve on a quadrant. Across the X axis, you have your low-stress moments on the left, high-stress moments on the right, and a peak of productivity in the middle. The Y axis shows your peak performance at the top, which is aligned with times when you have just a the right amount of stress behind your work. This means that you shouldn’t give yourself too much time to do a task, but should definitely not wait until the last minute. The way to do this is to create airtight to-do lists. Try the 1-3-5 method, which has you structure your day around one major task, three medium-sized ones, and five little ones. By breaking your day down and timing it just right, you can make sure everything gets done when it needs to, optimizing your stress in honor of psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nParkinson’s LawParkinson’s Law is another one that governs how long you should spend on any given task. In fact, it goes hand-in-hand with Yerkes-Dodson, because it says that the longer you give yourself to do something, the longer you'll naturally take to get it done. C. Northcote Parkinson popularized it in a 1955 essay for The Economist, concluding that you’ll ultimately procrastinate or over-complicate the task, dragging it out by not working on it enough or working on it way too long. Here, it helps to prioritize your to-dos and schedule your days and weeks thoroughly. Having a smaller window in which to work on pressing tasks will up the urgency, aligning you more with the peak of Yerkes-Dodson. Pre-plan your weeks using prioritization techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix and task batching, thinking about when you'll have just the right amount of urgency to motivate you to do each task.Once you've pre-plannned, try shaving the amount of time you give yourself to do things. If a project is due a week from now, don’t give yourself a whole week to get it done. Instead, Give yourself a personal deadline of five or even four days from now. Setting private deadlines ahead of your real ones is a good way to give your work some urgency while leaving a little wiggle room in case you don’t finish up in time for your personal deadline. It stops you from procrastinating or getting too in the weeds on busywork at the end. Illich’s LawThe third law here is cautioning against the same thing as the first two: You shouldn’t have too much time to work on any one thing. The reasons behind all three laws are different, though, which means the solutions to overcoming them are unique, too. Illich’s Law, or the Law of Diminishing Returns, says that after working for a while, your productivity decreases. Eventually, it goes negative, meaning your work isn’t even good anymore. At best, you're churning out something less than ideal. At worst, you'll waste more time in the future having to redo it.To defeat it, don’t just cut your deadlines down to combat Parkinson's Law; cut down how long you have to work on each task on your to-do list. Use time-tracking software or a simple spreadsheet for two weeks to track how long your usual duties typically take you, as well as when you start feeling bored or unproductive. After two weeks, cut the time you give yourself to do each task, ideally down to exactly how long it takes you to get bored or unproductive. In the gaps that appear in your schedule, make sure you take breaks. What Yerkes-Dodson and Parkinson’s Law don’t fully account for is the value of breaks to productivity. Giving yourself set times to work and set times to chill is foundational to all kinds of productivity methods because burnout is an output killer. You can (and should) always get back to work once you’re done with a little personal time. Carlson’s LawFinally, the fourth law, Carlson’s Law, is all about how you work, not how much you work. Swedish economist Sune Carlson’s assertion was that interrupted work is always less effective and more time-consuming than uninterrupted work. If you’re distracted, your work will be of a poorer quality and take longer—and as you can tell, work that takes longer is no good, for all kinds of reasons. Like the other laws, the trick to nailing this one is to schedule carefully every day. Not only do you need to schedule your day based on what needs to be done and how long it will take, but on when you can reasonably do it all without distraction. Time boxing, or the practice of scheduling every minute of your day in your calendar, blocking it all out down to the minute, is central to basically every productivity tip. In line with both Illich's and Carlson's Laws, not only should you keep in mind that you should give yourself less time to work than you think you need, but you should reflect that cut-down in your time boxes. When you do that, you'll see gaps or breaks start to appear in your daily calendar. Embrace those. Breaks are elemental to productivity, so you should be scheduling those as seriously as you do your work. Finally, when you’re aiming to defeat Carlson’s Law, you should take the extra step of making sure your now-thorough calendar is viewable by others in your organization or anyone who might interrupt you. If you’re likely to be distracted at a given time, don’t try to work on anything important then; wait until you can give it your full attention. In addition, never multitask. You can’t do two things at once. That’s just another form of distraction. Move from chore to chore, one at a time, to make sure you’re being efficient at all of them. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Instead, when you get a price drop notification on an object you've been tracking, you might now see a new \"buy for me\" button that will send all the necessary information to the store's website and make the final purchase for you.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says the AI will always ask your permission before starting agentic checkout, and will only go through with the purchase after you've confirmed all your shipping and payment details (which it will either pull from your Google Pay details, or directly ask you for). The price you'll see also isn't informed by AI, but rather by Google's Shopping Graph, the same information that powers Google Search's Shopping tab. That means it'll come directly from the store you'll be buying from, although while Google does promise it'll surface the most relevant offers for you, just trusting whatever the notification says will take away your ability to manually comparison shop. Once the AI has made your purchase for you, you should see all the usual confirmation emails hit whatever inbox you told the AI to link with your purchase. It all makes sense in theory—you're essentially being given a link to a product, and then telling the AI to go to that link and fill out the checkout form for you. That should cut down on hallucination concerns, assuming you're happy with the link you're buying from. The catch is that every website's checkout form is a little different, so Google's starting with just a few stores for now, to cut down on the chance for errors. That means you'll only be able to try agentic checkout when buying from Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and \"select Shopify merchants\" for now, but Google says there will be \"many more [stores] coming soon.\"\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhile agentic checkout does take what can be a lengthy process down to a single click for buyers, the real use case here might be for sellers. Ensuring people actually click through to your store from a price drop notification can be a pain, and letting customers buy straight from the notification with a single button could make impulse purchases a bit more likely. If you notice yourself about to buy something just because a shiny new button is there, maybe take a beat before tapping it and consider whether you still want it or if you want to check other options yourself first.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n                    \n    \nIf you want to try out agentic checkout for yourself, you'll first need to start tracking a product's price, and ensure it's something Wayfair, Chewy, or another participating retailer would sell. To do this, head to the Google Shopping tab, search for either a specific product or a broader product category, and scroll until you find a product card you want to track. Click through and hit the \"Track price button.\" Here, choose a target price as well as options like size or color, and click \"Update\" in the bottom right corner. You'll now get a notification when a listing matches the parameters you set, and if the link Google found is from a participating store, you'll be able to use the \"Buy for me\" button. Click or tap it to ensure your details are correct, then tap \"Buy for me with GPay\" at the bottom of the screen. You'll get a progress bar showing when your purchase has been submitted and confirmed, and the page will tell you where to expect your confirmation email. You'll also get a Buy for me reference ID you can take to Google support, in case you run into any issues.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nUnfortunately, it seems like there's still a few features Google needs to work on here before the AI can do everything a human can. A Google spokesperson told me that agentic checkout currently can't take factors like loyalty programs into account, so if you want to buy the product from a specific store account to get credit for it, you'll still need to make your purchase manually.If you're buying a lot, it could be a time saver, but as for now, those caveats and the limited selection of stores means you'll probably still have to complete checkout yourself on most purchases right now.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

To me, it sounded like the beginning of the end for physical wallets. In reality, it was anything but: Not only are the applications limited, but even after all this time, only 12 states and Puerto Rico actually support the feature. While the rest of us wait for our respective states to get on board, many might have another option for these virtual documents. On Wednesday, Apple announced \"Digital ID,\" a new initiative that lets you create an ID in the Wallet app using your passport. This bypasses the waiting period for the 38 states that don't yet support these ID features: If you have a passport, you can try this feature out today. Even if your state supports driver's license and state ID uploads to the Wallet app, you'll miss out on features if you don't have a REAL ID. If you have a passport, however, you can use it instead, which opens up the wallet ID feature to even more users than before. Like previous attempts at virtual IDs, however, don't expect to be able to use this Digital ID just anywhere you'd normally show documentation. Right now, the main use for Digital ID is for flying: According to Apple, Digital ID is launching in beta at over 250 airports to be used at TSA checkpoints. Importantly, this feature only supports domestic flights, even though it uses your passport. As such, do not rely on your Digital ID when flying outside of the U.S. You'll still need your physical passport in order to validate your identity. In the future, however, Apple says you'll be able to use this Digital ID for other purposes, such as booking flights and hotels, as well as opening new accounts.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow to add your passport to your iPhoneTo start, you'll need a valid U.S. passport, an iPhone 11 or later with iOS 26.1 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 6 or later with WatchOS 26.1. First, open the Wallet app on your iPhone, then tap the (+) at the top of the screen. Here, tap \"Digital ID\" under \"United States.\" Here, you'll see a pop-up which informs you about Digital ID. Tap \"Continue,\" then follow the on-screen instructions to scan different parts of your passport using your iPhone's camera. You'll next need to authenticate yourself by taking a Live Photo of your face. Once confirmed, you'll need to capture more angles of your face and head, which the Wallet app directs you through. Once validated, the ID will live in your Wallet app. You can open the Wallet app, or double-click the Side or Home button, then choose the ID whenever you need to present it. When in line at the TSA, for example, you can hold your iPhone with your ID activated near the reader: Once the two connect, the reader will take your photo, while your iPhone will show you all the information you'll be providing to TSA, which can include things like your legal name, date of birth, sex, nationality, ID number, ID photo, expiration date, the date the ID was added, and who verified the ID. You'll need to double-click the Side or Home button to confirm you want to share this data.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \n\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nIs Digital ID secure?Yes, at least according to Apple. The company says that any ID data you add to the Wallet app, be it a passport, driver's license, or state ID, is encrypted and stored on-device. That means that only you have access to this data—not even Apple can see it. In addition, Apple cannot see when you use your ID, nor can they see what data you shared at the time of identification. You also need to use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate yourself through this process, so even if someone steals your iPhone, they won't be able to obtain that ID data. As stated above, you will see a list of data that will be shared when authenticating with Digital ID. If you aren't comfortable sharing this data with, say, TSA, you don't have to double-click the Side or Home button, and can instead choose another form of authentication. Plus, the way this feature is set up, you don't need to unlock your iPhone or physically hand it over to confirm your iPhone. By double-clicking the Side button or Home button, you can access the ID data without compromising your iPhone. I'm pretty privacy conscious, but this is a feature I'd be willing to try—assuming I fly out of an airport that supports it. I could see how this might be a bridge too far for some people, especially considering the amount of face scanning you need to do to validate the ID. But Apple says in its Wallet app that this data is used to validate your identity and prevent fraud, and is retained only until the issuing authority approves or denies your ID. In other words, whether or not setup is successful, Apple will delete your face scans once the process is over. Seeing as the rest of the data is encrypted, that might just be enough for me to be comfortable testing this out. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Apple brought RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging to the iPhone with iOS 18 last year, giving green-bubble users access to more features and functions. But what exactly is possible with RCS on the iPhone, and what is still exclusive to iMessage users? Are Android RCS users now fully integrated into chats in the iOS Messages app or not?I'll lay out exactly what you can do in RCS chats between iPhones and Android phones, and explain which features are still missing—and when you might be able to get them.  If you've got contacts on other mobile platforms, this should help you understand more about what the experience is like from their end.To use RCS, you must have a carrier that supports it (most now do). On an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging to enable it. In Google Messages on Android, tap your profile picture (top right), then choose Messages settings and RCS chats to turn on the feature.\nEver since iOS 18, RCS messaging has officially been supported in the iOS Messages app—specifically, via the RCS Universal Profile 2.4. This brings green bubble Android users closer to parity with iMessage users, though some features only work in one direction, and some features only work in one-to-one conversations and not group chats.One notable upgrade is support for high-resolution photos and videos, which should work seamlessly across all your RCS-enabled conversations, with no more issues around compression or transfer. Web links look better as well, because you'll get a proper preview shown on both Android and iOS, and you can share current locations too (though only as a static pin, not a live and updating one).\n    \n            \n            Web links now look much better between iOS and Android.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nTyping indicators and read receipts are supported in both directions, assuming you've got them enabled on your devices. However, they don't work in group chats—RCS users on Android can now join group chats, but the experience can be buggy based on reports, and you lose the typing indicators and the read receipts.Emoji reactions are now supported, up to a point—but based on my testing, these only work from iPhone to Android. If you try and send an emoji reaction in the other direction, iPhone users will just get a separate text showing the emoji (it won't appear as a bubble on top of the original message).\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nRCS on iOS and Android: what you can't do (yet)If you look at everything you can do in iMessage (with other iMessage users) and Google Messages (with other Android RCS users), you'll realize there's a long way to go when it comes to cross-platform support. For example, at the moment you can't unsend messages, or reply inline in a thread, either from Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android.You can edit messages, but only if you're an Android user messaging an iPhone user—and with the caveat that the iPhone user gets two texts (the original message and the edited message, which rather defeats the point). The ability to edit messages on an iPhone simply doesn't appear in an RCS conversation.\n    \n            \n            Message editing is something that doesn't quite work yet.\n                                        Credit: Lifehacker\n                    \n    \nAnother missing feature is end-to-end encryption for your chats and files shared in them. Apple has promised that support for this in RCS conversations is on the way, though it hasn't shown up yet—not even in iOS 26. This should give you pause when it comes to sharing sensitive information in these chats.Full end-to-end encryption is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which Google is testing in beta and which Apple has yet to adopt. Once this next update finally makes its way to iPhones and Android devices, interoperability will be leveled up again—it should, in theory, bring with it full support for message editing, emoji reactions, and inline replies. Until then, it's something of a half-baked implementation, especially for group chats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        \n        If you're a Windows user, this is your monthly reminder to ensure you install all available security updates. Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday release fixes one zero-day vulnerability that has been actively exploited in the wild, with 63 flaws patched in total. As reported by Bleeping Computer, the November Patch Tuesday update addresses 29 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, 2 security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 16 remote code execution vulnerabilities, 11 information disclosure vulnerabilities, 2 denial of service vulnerabilities, and 3 spoofing vulnerabilities. (Note that these figures do not include patches for Microsoft Edge and Mariner.)In addition to the zero-day, four of the vulnerabilities being addressed—two remote code execution bugs and one each of the elevation of privilege and information disclosure flaws—are labeled \"critical.\" \nPatch fixes one zero-day threatAll security updates are important to install as soon as possible, but especially those that patch zero-days, which are vulnerabilities that are actively exploited or publicly exposed before the developer makes an official fix available. Without this month's patch, Windows users are vulnerable to CVE-2025-62215, an elevation of privilege flaw in the Windows Kernel. The bug allows threat actors to gain system privileges upon winning a \"race condition,\" or improper synchronization in Windows Kernel. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nThe vulnerability was identified by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), though no additional details about exploitation have been made public. Other updates for Windows usersWindows 11 users will also see the rollout of the upgraded Start menu alongside Patch Tuesday updates—the new interface is scrollable with app categories and adapts to the size of your screen. Other changes include an redesigned battery icon and improved features for File Explorer, Voice Access, and Click to Do. As of last month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has ended support for Windows 10, though users who have enrolled in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will continue to get security patches through Oct. 13, 2026. \n            ",

Take satellite connectivity for example: For most of the time cellphones and smartphones have existed, losing cell signal meant your mobile device was largely useless. With satellite connectivity, however, as long as you're within range of a satellite, you can continue to make calls and send texts. It's remarkable, for both the convenience of communication, as well as your safety. Right now, there are only a few companies leading the satellite connectivity charge, at least as far as consumer technology goes. T-Mobile is the only carrier pushing it, having partnered with Starlink to offer satellite communications to its customers. But you don't need T-Mobile for satellite connectivity if you have an iPhone: Since 2022, Apple has been building the iPhone's ability to connect to satellites, starting with Emergency SOS via Satellite (the ability to reach out to emergency services over satellite), before rolling out general satellite messaging with iOS 18. Whether you have T-Mobile, an iPhone, or both, it's possible to send your friend a text in the middle of nowhere, assuming you have a clear line of site to a satellite overhead. Amazing. And according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has some major plans to expand the iPhone's satellite connectivity capabilities.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \n\"Natural usage\" improvementsPerhaps most importantly, Apple wants you to be able to connect to satellites without the need for an unobstructed view of the sky. Right now, that's arguably one of the technology's biggest hurdles: It's great when you have a clear path between your iPhone and a satellite, but if there's something in the way—say, a bunch of trees, or if you're inside a building—the signal might not reach. The company is working on what is called \"natural usage\" improvements, which would support satellite connectivity across a wider variety of situations. Maybe your iPhone is in your pocket, or you're in your car, but it's as if you're outside in a wide open clearing. Apple Maps via satelliteOnce you're able to connect to satellites in more places, the other new features become even more useful. That includes a new version of Apple Maps that supports satellites, which would let you use the app without needing wifi or cellular. This is probably the feature I'd be most be excited for: It can be so stressful trying to pull up directions in an area with low to no signal, so to know you almost always have a way to connect Maps—even if it's slower than usual—would be a relief. Sending photos via satelliteMessaging is another area that will reportedly see some improvement: While you can currently text over cellular, Gurman says Apple is working on supporting sending photos over satellite as well.Third-party supportIt won't just be Apple's own apps and services that are benefitting, either. Gurman says Apple is working on an API to let third-party developers add satellite support to their apps as well. Apple's own software may have the best experience, but it does open the door for expanded support. Other navigation apps, like Google Maps, could potentially connect to satellite this way. If you prefer it over Apple Maps, you wouldn't have to stick with your iPhone's built-in maps app when you don't have cell service. More coverage for future iPhonesWhile it wouldn't impact current iPhone owners, the iPhone 18 will likely support 5G NTN, which lets cell towers themselves connect to satellites to boost coverage.   When these features will launchApple can't add all of these improvements on their own, unfortunately. According to Gurman, the company will need Globalstar, the company that builds this satellite infrastructure, to make hardware improvements on their end. Assuming that happens, the idea of \"dead zones\" may be a relic of the first quarter of the 21st century.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

That's no surprise from a company like Google, who is among those leading the AI charge right now. If you use Chrome, Android, or Google Workspace, you've likely dealt with Gemini in some capacity. The charge, as you might expect, continues to this day. On Tuesday, Google announced a set of new AI-powered features coming to Google Photos, for both iOS and Android users. Google doesn't yet have a definitive release date for these new features, but it seems they're rolling out soon. These are largely optional—you can keep using Photos as an image library, and avoid using the AI features if you wish. But if you have an interest, especially in AI image editing, here's what you can expect to see: Nano BananaNano Banana is Google's current \"big thing\" in AI imaging. The model allows you to generate or edit images with greater flexibility than previous models—specifically, you can use it to change a single photo in multiple ways, while keeping the subjects consistent across edits. You can ask Nano Banana to change hairdos, outfits, sceneries, image styles, add or remove elements, stack edits, and even combine different attributes of multiple photos. If you take Google's word for it, it's a big deal. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nNow, Google is making Nano Banana available in Google Photos' editor. You'll find the tool under the new \"Help me edit\" button when opening a photo in the app. Here, you'll be able to ask the app to make whatever changes you'd like. Google suggests prompts like turning you into the monarch on a deck of cards; transforming a picture into a tiled mosaic; or adding a winter theme to an image to make your family's holiday card. \n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nWe will need to investigate whether Google Photos' Nano Banana editor stack up to the tool you've been able to use in Gemini. But the option is now there, should you choose to use it. Personalized editsWhat is a photo? You might think that's a simple one to answer: You point your camera at some, snap away, and boom: A picture is born. But companies like Google are changing the ways we take and edit photos, to the point where that question isn't so easy to answer. If you adjust the image itself to such a degree that much of the original data is no longer there, is that really a photo? Did that really capture reality? I'm not so sure. That's how I'm feeling about Google's new \"personalized edits\" for Google Photos. The company says you can fix \"minor flaws,\" such as blinks or sad faces, with the new \"Help me edit\" tool. If your kid had their eyes closed during the picture, for example, you can ask \"Help me edit\" to open their eyes. Google Photos then pulls data from other photos with your kid to generate a version of the photo with their eyes open. Again, I ask you: What is a photo?Google has used this tech before: Best Take, for example, can snap a series of photos at once, then use the best version of each subject's face to composite the \"best take.\" It's clever, but it's also strange, especially when the data is not pulled from a different version of the same scene, but from different images of that person from the past. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nGoogle Photos for iPhone catches up to AndroidGoogle is also rolling out new previously Android-only features for iPhone users with the Google Photos app. First, the iOS app now support \"ask to edit,\" a feature that lets you use text or your voice to request edits from Google's AI. Now, of course, both apps use Nano Banana, but previously, only Android's app supported this natural language editing system. In addition, iPhone users will notice a redesigned photo editor. This is the same one Google announced back in May for Android users. The new editor includes edit suggestions (powered by AI, of course) that apply multiple effects at once to your photos. You can also tap on an area of your photo to receive suggested tools for making edits. Ask about your photosI feel like I'm saying \"ask\" a lot in this article, but that's the crux of Google's new features here. To wit, the last new feature Google announced for Photos is simply the ability to ask about the images themselves. You can ask about the content of the picture, request similar images in your library, or, if you want, ask for edits. It seems Nano Banana follows you around in multiple places in this update.Again, none of these new AI features are mandatory if you want to keep using Google Photos AI-free. You can still edit your images yourself; you'll just need to avoid the \"Help me edit\" button. You can look at your photo's metadata manually, instead of using the Ask button. But it does seem, for the foreseeable future, like Google is all-in on these AI features. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

The good news? Google is releasing a handful of new features for your device, via its November Pixel Drop. And among the new changes, like Google Photos' Nano Banana upgrade, is something genuinely useful: a new power saving mode for Google Maps. The bad news? Your Pixel probably doesn't support it. According to Google, the new Power Saving Mode is simple to use. Whenever you want to spare your battery some excess power consumption while using driving directions in Google Maps, you can tap a new power button in the app. Once you do, Google Maps will shift into a \"simplified layout\": From Google's press release image, this turns the map black and white, with no discernible elements other than the road, your driving arrow, ETA, and upcoming turns. The feature currently only works with driving directions, so you won't see the option for walking or biking directions, nor can you use it in landscape.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Google\n                    \n    \nGoogle says this new layout can save your Pixel's battery life for up to four hours—though that depends on a number of factors, including the assumption that your phone is charged to 100% at the start, and that brightness is set at P90 and Adaptive Brightness is disabled. But if that's true, it could be huge: If you're on a road trip without power, that can keep your phone going much longer. You could either eke out another four hours of navigation time in the car, or actually have some battery to spare when you reach your destination.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy is this a Pixel 10 exclusive?But before all the Pixel owners of the world get too excited, the feature comes with disappointing fine print. Only Pixel 10 devices—meaning Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—can use Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. Google: What gives?Google doesn't actually offer any explanation as to why Power Saving Mode is exclusive to its newest line of Pixels. As Android Central notes, the feature likely takes advantage of Android's upcoming AOD Min Mode, which lets apps use the device's Always-on Display to save power while running visually simplistic versions of their programs. AOD Min Mode isn't widely available to developers yet, and will likely arrive with Android 17, but it doesn't seem exclusive to Pixel 10—or Pixel, for that matter. Most Android phones these days have Always-on Displays, so AOD Min Mode should theoretically work with them—not just phones released this year.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nIf I had to guess, Google won't keep this feature locked to the Pixel 10 line forever. The company is probably using this limited rollout as an opportunity to test out AOD Min Mode with a smaller pool of users. Since the Pixel 10 series is the company's newest set of devices, it'd be a prime candidate for a test. The company could then take the feedback and analytics from this beta, and use it to help developers better optimize their apps for this experience. Perhaps then, Google would expand support to more Pixel devices, or more Android devices in general. For now, however, only Pixel 10 users can try out Power Saving Mode in Google Maps. I don't have one of these newest Pixels, but if I did, I wouldn't be surprised if I just kept this mode on all the time. Frankly, it looks cool, and if it saves me battery at the same time, all the better.Google seems to be making battery life savings a priority. Starting next year, the company will start dinging apps that excessively wake the display, either by removing those apps from Play Store discovery pages, or by issuing a warning to users on the app's Play Store page itself.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

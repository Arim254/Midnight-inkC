I've written before about other ways to mold Pomodoro to match what you need, but today's idea, Pomodoro 2.0, is one of the easiest and most effective adaptations. What do I mean by \"Pomodoro 2.0?\"First, a refresher on what the Pomodoro technique even is. When you're using this technique to focus and be productive, you set an alarm for 25 minutes, work for that time, then take a five-minute break. You complete that cycle four times, then give yourself a longer break at the end, up to half an hour, before starting again. That's it. It works because you spend those relatively short bursts concentrating on the task at hand, knowing a reprieve is coming. Since they're not too long, it doesn't feel insurmountable. It also works because those breaks play an important role. Taking periodic breaks can make you more productive, both because they give your brain a rest and because they stop you from toiling to the point that your output gets shoddy.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nI saw the idea of \"Pomodoro 2.0\" mentioned on a forum a while back and started Googling. What I found impressed me—it addresses one of the main critiques I have of the original, which is that 25 minutes isn't always enough time to get into a state of deep work, or work that is uninterrupted, purely focused, and effortless enough that time seems to be flowing by.Over at Beyond Productivity, Dr. Christian Poensgen recommends starting the Pomodoro session with a 30-minute work block, then adding more time to it after the break, tacking on between 15 or 60 minutes. I recommend doing this incrementally, adding 15 every time, so you work for 30, then 45, then 60, and finally 75 minutes before your big break. Adding too much too soon—or working in too-large chunks all the way through—defeats one of the main purposes of the technique, which is to not get overwhelmed, so taking it slower and easier while still adding on time is the best bet.If you're not sure how much time to add on, familiarize yourself with the concept of flowtime. Also known as \"flowmodoro,\" the idea here is that you should track how long you can work on a given task before you feel drained, track how long your breaks need to be to make you feel reenergized, and start creating custom, Pomodoro-esque work and rest blocks for every kind of task you do in a given day. It takes a bit of data collection and planning, but it can help you master the general technique while still prioritizing deep work and breaks.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhy use Pomodoro 2.0?The Pomodoro technique shines (and has been so popular for so long) because it helps you ease into your work, motivated by the small work sprints and promise of rewards. It's absolutely true that you need to take breaks to keep your productivity up, so that part should never be altered or skipped, but sometimes, 25-minute grind sessions just aren't enough and five minutes to reset isn't, either. Getting into a state of deep work takes time. Repeatedly stopping yourself before you hit that point is counter-productive. Giving yourself more time to work on harder, more complex tasks is critical in some instances, just like taking breaks. Adding time to the work blocks in increments helps you settle in and get more done without overwhelming yourself. You should consider this alteration if you have a major project that demands a lot of resources or energy, letting yourself build up to the hard parts as you add minutes to your timer. If you're trying this out and not getting the results you want, you can shake it up another way, too. Remember the idea of \"eating the frog,\" or tackling your biggest to-do list item first thing in the morning? Consider eating the frog in Pomodoro 2.0, starting with your 75-minute block and working backward to 60, 45, and 30. Remember, none of these rules are hard and fast; you can make changes that match your needs and personal preferences. If you're someone who doesn't get overwhelmed and has the ability to jump in on long-term work, this structure could suit you, as the promise of shorter and shorter work sessions can feel like a motivator of its own. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

That's not necessarily a bad thing, as far as I'm concerned. From where I'm sitting, many of us couldn't care less about the latest AI features companies are shoving into their products—we just want the products we actually use to work, and work well. But strictly focusing on AI progress, Apple is far behind rivals like Google and Microsoft. While Android and Windows are full of AI features, either through Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT models, Apple's first-party AI advances are much more limited. Both Google and Microsoft promote their AI assistants as a cornerstone of their marketing strategies; meanwhile, Apple pulled it AI Siri commercial, as its promised upgrades kept getting delayed.That's not to say there aren't any AI features here—far from it. Since iOS 18, Apple has rolled out AI features under the Apple Intelligence umbrella, including things like Image Playground, AI image editing, and Writing Tools. But, again, these features are not selling iPhones, and it seems like Apple knows it. The company appears to be doing more AI work behind the scenes than in front of it these days.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDespite all this, the company is still making serious in-roads with AI. In fact, the company is planning three key new AI features, at least according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.AI SiriRemember how I said Apple's AI Siri upgrade keeps getting delayed? Well, as it happens, AI Siri might be here sooner than later—at least, in part. According to Gurman, Apple plans to roll out \"a new Siri\" with iOS 26.4, while the assistant will get a \"redesign\" with next year's iOS 27. If you recall, Apple promised an AI-powered Siri with iOS 18 that was smarter than any iteration of Siri that had come before. This AI Siri was highly contextual, understanding what you meant in your requests without you needing to be hyper-specific. In addition, the assistant could pull information from a variety of sources, such as messages or emails, to fulfill requests, and even had an agent mode to take actions on your behalf. This is similar to how AI browsers let you ask the assistant to do things on the web for you. It's objectively futuristic, to be sure, but not necessarily useful—nor is it secure.As it happens, Apple had a lot of trouble actually getting those features to work. The company's new Siri is an extreme engineering puzzle that wasn't solved by iOS 18's release, and was delayed through iOS 26.0. If the schedule holds, those changes should be coming to 26.4, and may even be powered in part by Google's Gemini model. That said, iOS 26.4 is likely four months away: Apple just released iOS 26.1 and is beta testing iOS 26.2, and neither update comes with any Siri upgrades. Since the company released iOS 18.4 in March of this year, chances are we'll see 26.4 in March 2026. If so, we might only be a quarter year away from a new Siri experience. Next year, according to Gurman, Siri will get a total makeover. The assistant will be more conversational, and will power Apple's upcoming smart home device strategy. But that's a ways away yet.AI health agent Gurman says Apple is also working on an AI agent that can coach users on health-related issues. Codenamed \"Project Mulberry,\" the service combines a new Health app, subscription (Health+), and AI health assistant. This assistant can pull data from the Health app to inform its advice, and is being trained using real doctors across medical professions. According to Gurman, \"if the Health app receives data about poor heart-rate trends, a video explaining the risks of heart disease could appear.\"The company is actually opening studio space to record videos for this service, and may feature a \"major doctor personality\" to \"host\" this Health+ service. (My money's on Doctor Mike, but maybe that's the only major doctor personality I know.)Gurman says this AI health agent could arrive as soon as iOS 26.4, alongside the new AI Siri. It will be interesting to see how Apple squares two key problems with this feature: AI sometimes makes mistakes (and sometimes just makes things up), so trusting it to offer health advice raises some red flags. Add in the fact that Apple will be using user data to inform the AI on how to handle health advice, and user privacy questions pop up. The company prides itself on privacy, so I imagine it will have a clear plan here, but if this AI health agent really launches, these points will need to be addressed. Web search toolFinally, Gurman says that Apple has \"plans for an AI-powered web search tool.\" This tool is called \"World Knowledge Answers\" within the company, and is intended to compete against similar search tools from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity. World Knowledge Answers will integrate directly within Siri, and may come to Safari and Spotlight too. It may include text, images, videos, and \"local points of interest,\" as well as AI summaries. The idea is to keep users asking questions within Apple's own suite of products, rather than see them use other AI search tools. It's likely it'll arrive alongside these other two features with iOS 26.4.Will these AI features be enough to catch Apple up to the rest of the AI players? I'm not sure. But I'm not sure the company needs to catch up. As much as Microsoft has made AI a cornerstone of its new Windows experiences, it's not the reason people are buying PCs. Similarly, few users are choosing their smartphones, tablets, and computers based on whether Apple, Google, or Microsoft has the best AI assistant, or the best array of AI features. AI might be big money right now, but not in a way where Apple needs to be on top to remain one of the biggest companies in the world. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

(Unless you've had more success than I have at hammering a nail into a block of wood with your fists). But tools themselves can often be augmented with accessories that make them a little easier to use, more effective, and safer—think of these accessories as tools for your tools. Even the best-stocked tool chest can be improved with the addition of a few simple, low-cost accessories. Here are eight that every DIYer should pick up to make their next project a little easier.Bucket organizersMy DIY process used to involve several trips back and forth between the project site and my tool closet, because I can only carry so much stuff at one time. Stuffing tools and loose screws into your pockets might get the job done, but it isn’t pretty, especially when the clawtooth hammer gets stuck in your pocket and you rip your pants open while standing on your roof in full view of the neighborhood, which is definitely not something that has ever happened to me. That’s why a bucket organizer (like the Bucketeer) is a must-have. It’s so simple it’s ridiculous: These organizers slide into the bucket and act as a tool belt around the exterior. You can still use the bucket as a bucket, while also easily transporting your gear.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nDepth stop collarsOne lesson I’ve learned in my DIY journey is that I’m never as in control of my power tools as I think I am. The evidence for this is all the times I’ve drilled way too deep for what I need. Whether you need a series of holes drilled to a precise depth, or you want to avoid overdrilling through the back of something, you quickly learn that eyeballing stuff and drilling by “feel” is an easy way to screw everything up. Having a set of depth collars like these is the answer. They clamp onto your bit and prevent you from over- or under-drilling. Aside from the precision, they also allow you to put full force behind the drill, because you don’t have to worry about losing control at the critical moment and over-drilling.Anti-vibration padsDIY projects can be pretty noisy. An anti-vibration pad like this one is an essential tool accessory. It reduces the noise from vibration and helps to protect the surface under your tools or materials so you can work safely. You can buy these in pre-sized versions, but buying a roll allows you to cut it up to fit your needs, so you can create pads for use under appliances (like the washing machine) to reduce noise and vibration, to use under portable saws and other tools, and to slide under materials that you’re working on. It’s a simple fix that makes DIY projects a lot more pleasant.Dust collectorsDust is a byproduct of just about every project you’ll ever do around the house. You can try hanging plastic sheets or using tape and/or envelopes to catch dust, but in my experience, neither really works—dust still gets everywhere. That's why this dust collector from DeWalt is a genius tool accessory: It suctions to the wall and connects to your wet/dry shopvac, effortlessly capturing all that dust from drilling and sanding.Anti-vibration gloves or wrapsIf you’ve ever used a power tool for a long stretch of time, you know how tired your hands and arms can get. You can reduce that stress on your body by reducing the vibrations you absorb from your tools with either anti-vibration gloves or an anti-vibration wrap that you can apply to hand tools (like hammers). These accessories absorb those vibrations, not only making them more comfortable to use but also increasing your control, because the tool won’t vibrate right out of your hands.Magnetic wristbandsIf you’ve ever wasted an hour of your life trying to find a dropped screw because you had no spares (I can neither confirm nor deny I’ve done this), you need a simple magnetic wristband like this one. It gives you a hands-free way to hang onto screws, bolts, nails, drill bits, or anything else metallic that you’re working with.Flexible drill bitsInevitably you’ll find yourself pondering how you can drill or screw something around a corner, or in a very tight space where no power tool could possibly fit. The answer is this amazing tool accessory: A flexible bit holder. With one of these, you can drill around corners or inside tight spots where a traditional bit can’t go, thus removing one more obstacle to getting your project finished.Laser saw guideIf you use a miter saw or any kind of circular saw, you know that even when you carefully measure and mark your materials, you can still mess up the cut. Undercut by the slightest margin and you’ll waste time sanding ends down or trying to make impossibly small extra cuts. Overcut, and you just wasted your time, effort, and materials.Adding a laser guide to your blade eliminates this risk. It clearly and accurately shows you exactly where your blade is going to bite, so you’ll know immediately if you’re a fraction of a millimeter off. You’ll be able to adjust before you cut, preventing frustration and waste.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n            Features editor\n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

If you work on a larger team or need to track highly ambitious, long-term goals, for example, SMART might not be the best method to turn to. Other goal-tracking methods, like FAST and PACT, may be a better fit. You'll need to start by familiarizing yourself with these alternate methods, but once you do, you'll see that they are more tailored to specific needs and might just be your best bet.When should you use SMART goals?SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound—that's what the acronym spells out. When you make them, you make sure your goal sticks to all five of those requirements, usually writing it out in a sentence like this: “By the end of the month, I will have aced three practice quizzes to prepare for my chemistry test.” It’s specific because it says what you’re going to do and why, measurable because you’re setting an amount of quizzes and expected grade on each, achievable because it can reasonably be done, relevant because it has to do with a pressing need, and time-bound because it’s related to a forthcoming deadline.Because they're so customizable, SMART goals are used by students, workers, and anyone who needs to break down their to-do list into manageable action items, but they can be limiting for the same reasons they work so well on an individual level. For example, they can be too specific to be broadly applicable, so if you have to do the same sort of task at work every month, you’ll redo the SMART goal every time instead of creating a process to follow. They’re also not ideal for collaboration because while you can share a SMART goal with others, it doesn’t leave much room to be concise and authoritative about who needs to do what to reach the goal. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhen FAST goals make senseThe first helpful SMART goal alternative is the FAST goal, which is especially useful if you’re in a position to lead or delegate, but is generally good for teams overall. FAST stands for the following: Frequent discussionsAmbitious scopeSpecific measurementsTransparentWhen using SMART goals, you analyze your desired end result through the lens of how achievable it is and when you’ll have it done. With a FAST goal, you’re looking less at the elements that define the final product and more at how you will collaborate to get there. FAST goals enable teams to adapt and evolve as the project goes on because they require frequent discussions and transparency about what the ambitious goal is and how its success will be defined. Still, you need to have a plan in place to follow the FAST goal, since it is a little vague. What are \"frequent\" discussions, for instance? You need to hammer that out with the team and set a goal dictating what frequent means and how you'll conduct those meetings.Say your team at work has to build a report for the end of the quarter. You already know when it’s due, so you don’t need to incorporate timeliness, like you would with a SMART goal. Instead, consider the task through the FAST lens, setting up regular times to meet and discuss it and creating clear communication channels so everyone can stay on the same page. The success of the project might be measured by manager feedback, client response, the enhancement of processes, or increases in sales; you need to define early on what “success” will look like, but staying communicative and transparent will help—and will enable you to make the end goal ambitious. Here, I'd recommend incorporating a single source of truth, or SSOT. That's essentially a folder everyone has access to that includes every resource anyone might need. For the hypothetical project of the end-of-quarter report, your SSOT might include monthly reports, a template for the bigger report, contact information for clients whose data will appear on the report, and so on. The first document in the SSOT should be one outlining the FAST goal by setting requirements for the frequent discussions, detailing the scope, defining the specific measurements of success, and, by its nature, being transparent. When to use PACT goalsPACT goals, like FAST goals, focus more on the process of achieving a desired result than the measurements of the result itself. Here’s what PACT stands for: PurposefulActionableContinuousTrackableLike a SMART goal, PACT works well if you’re tackling something on your own, but it is more process-driven. Let’s say your goal is to get in shape. With a SMART goal, you might have to define it like, “By the first day of summer, I will have worked out for five hours per week, lost 20 pounds, and increased my muscle mass by 5%.” It’s specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, but once you write that down, you’re on your own fighting your way to the finish line. A PACT goal might look more like, “To get in better shape and improve my health, I will work out five times a week and monitor my weight loss and muscle gain using my smart scale.” Instead of being time-bound, this approach takes the process itself into consideration—but also incorporates purposefulness, reminding you why you’re doing what you’re doing. You still take actions and track metrics, but the goal is rooted in purpose and relies on continuity, not a defined end result. Keeping the purpose front and center is important, as it helps you stay motivated and reminds you of what you’re really working toward. If you’re building a report at work, you can get caught up in the absolutism of knowing this is your assigned task and you have to do it, which can lead to losing sight of why you're actually toiling. If you bear in mind that you’re building the report so your company can bring in more clients or enhance internal operations, you remember that this could lead to more business, accolades, or even a raise for you. Tracking your progress is also key to staying motivated and moving toward an end goal, even if it isn’t as rigidly defined as a SMART goal might be. Again, you'll need a document that outlines all this. Think of it like a mission statement and stick it in the SSOT. Here, it might be like, \"Our team will compile the report by each dedicating one hour of time to it a day for the next month, inputting our work hours and achievements into the attached spreadsheet, and meeting every Friday to discuss progress.\" \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBut it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Naturally, scammers are using this model to collect your personal data and promising huge rewards that never materialize. According to a report from Malwarebytes Labs, bad actors are luring users into taking surveys through malvertising ads claiming you've won a Walmart voucher for hundreds of dollars. All you have to do is answer a few questions—easy enough—but you're actually handing over information that can be used to target you even further. Surveys promising big rewards are a scamThese scams start with malvertising (malicious advertising) like website pop-ups and banners, spam emails, and social media ads stating that you've been selected to receive a \"free\" gift card worth hundreds of dollars. The fake ads use official logos from recognizable brands, which build trust, along with countdown timers, which promote urgency. You may think you've gotten lucky, and all you have to do is take a short survey to earn a big payout. When you click through, though, you're redirected to a fake rewards page, which may also look credible thanks to stolen branding. You'll be prompted to provide personal information, such as your name, phone number, email, and address, as well as indicate interest in topics like home repair and insurance. You may be redirected again based on your answers—to a spoofed home improvement site for FindMyWindowPro or Renewal By Anderson, for example—where you're prompted to provide even more data. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThis endless loop of surveys doesn't end with a gift card payout, and along the way, you've handed scammers a lot of information that can be sold and used to target you with much more personalized scams in the future based on interests you've handed them. Survey scams may seem like simply a waste of time rather than a real threat, since you don't lose any money right away. But you may see more spam calls and believable phishing emails as a result. Avoid fake survey scamsLike all scams, this one plays on emotion: notably, the excitement of getting lucky and winning big. You're lured in with a sense of urgency and the illusion of low effort. Scammers also use real branding to make the scheme seem more credible. As always, these elements should raise suspicion. Retailers are almost never offering promotions that are too good to be true, and you should never provide personal information in exchange for a \"free\" prize. If you do click through one of these ads, look carefully at the URL, which is almost certainly not the retailer's official domain. How to actually get paid for taking surveysYou can get paid to take surveys or test apps and games, though you certainly won't earn the hundreds of dollars promised in survey scams. The pay is low for the time invested (in most cases, a few dollars per hour) and some survey platforms require you to hit a minimum amount earned to request a payout. You typically have to engage consistently and across multiple platforms to make it worthwhile. NerdWallet compiled a list of popular survey-for-money apps, including Make Money, Eureka, InboxDollars Surveys, Google Opinion Rewards, and Swagbucks. Reddit users also suggest Survey Junkie and Branded Surveys. Prolific is a relatively high-paying platform, though you have to join a waitlist to gain access. Of course, you should know that even legitimate survey sites collect a lot of personal information, such as your birth date, zip code, phone number, and health history. All of this may be sold to data brokers, and there's always a risk of a data breach that could lead to identity theft. Be sure to weigh the risks and rewards of signing up for these platforms. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

To me, it sounded like the beginning of the end for physical wallets. In reality, it was anything but: Not only are the applications limited, but even after all this time, only 12 states and Puerto Rico actually support the feature. While the rest of us wait for our respective states to get on board, many might have another option for these virtual documents. On Wednesday, Apple announced \"Digital ID,\" a new initiative that lets you create an ID in the Wallet app using your passport. This bypasses the waiting period for the 38 states that don't yet support these ID features: If you have a passport, you can try this feature out today. Even if your state supports driver's license and state ID uploads to the Wallet app, you'll miss out on features if you don't have a REAL ID. If you have a passport, however, you can use it instead, which opens up the wallet ID feature to even more users than before. Like previous attempts at virtual IDs, however, don't expect to be able to use this Digital ID just anywhere you'd normally show documentation. Right now, the main use for Digital ID is for flying: According to Apple, Digital ID is launching in beta at over 250 airports to be used at TSA checkpoints. Importantly, this feature only supports domestic flights, even though it uses your passport. As such, do not rely on your Digital ID when flying outside of the U.S. You'll still need your physical passport in order to validate your identity. In the future, however, Apple says you'll be able to use this Digital ID for other purposes, such as booking flights and hotels, as well as opening new accounts.  \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nHow to add your passport to your iPhoneTo start, you'll need a valid U.S. passport, an iPhone 11 or later with iOS 26.1 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 6 or later with WatchOS 26.1. First, open the Wallet app on your iPhone, then tap the (+) at the top of the screen. Here, tap \"Digital ID\" under \"United States.\" Here, you'll see a pop-up which informs you about Digital ID. Tap \"Continue,\" then follow the on-screen instructions to scan different parts of your passport using your iPhone's camera. You'll next need to authenticate yourself by taking a Live Photo of your face. Once confirmed, you'll need to capture more angles of your face and head, which the Wallet app directs you through. Once validated, the ID will live in your Wallet app. You can open the Wallet app, or double-click the Side or Home button, then choose the ID whenever you need to present it. When in line at the TSA, for example, you can hold your iPhone with your ID activated near the reader: Once the two connect, the reader will take your photo, while your iPhone will show you all the information you'll be providing to TSA, which can include things like your legal name, date of birth, sex, nationality, ID number, ID photo, expiration date, the date the ID was added, and who verified the ID. You'll need to double-click the Side or Home button to confirm you want to share this data.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Apple\n                    \n    \nIs Digital ID secure?Yes, at least according to Apple. The company says that any ID data you add to the Wallet app, be it a passport, driver's license, or state ID, is encrypted and stored on-device. That means that only you have access to this data—not even Apple can see it. In addition, Apple cannot see when you use your ID, nor can they see what data you shared at the time of identification. You also need to use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate yourself through this process, so even if someone steals your iPhone, they won't be able to obtain that ID data. As stated above, you will see a list of data that will be shared when authenticating with Digital ID. If you aren't comfortable sharing this data with, say, TSA, you don't have to double-click the Side or Home button, and can instead choose another form of authentication. Plus, the way this feature is set up, you don't need to unlock your iPhone or physically hand it over to confirm your iPhone. By double-clicking the Side button or Home button, you can access the ID data without compromising your iPhone. I'm pretty privacy conscious, but this is a feature I'd be willing to try—assuming I fly out of an airport that supports it. I could see how this might be a bridge too far for some people, especially considering the amount of face scanning you need to do to validate the ID. But Apple says in its Wallet app that this data is used to validate your identity and prevent fraud, and is retained only until the issuing authority approves or denies your ID. In other words, whether or not setup is successful, Apple will delete your face scans once the process is over. Seeing as the rest of the data is encrypted, that might just be enough for me to be comfortable testing this out. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

From roof leaks to burst pipes—water damage is the second-most claimed loss on home insurance policies, just below “wind and hail.” In fact, there are way more losses due to water damage than fire.And the most troubling aspect of water damage is how silent it can be. You can have a leak for a long time before the damage becomes bad enough to notice. And even if you know you have a water leak somewhere, locating it can often be difficult because water can travel a long way from the source before making its presence known. That’s why you need these five kinds of leak detectors on hand, so you’ll know when a damaging water leak erupts, and be able to find it quickly to minimize the damage.Moisture alarmsStep one is to have water detectors with alarms set up around the house in places where leaks are probable. These alarms are typically wifi-connected and simply detect moisture beyond a normal level, ringing out an audible alarm and sending a message to your devices warning you of a leak. Having them placed in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, basements, attics, and anywhere else where the home comes into contact with water means leaks will be noticed right away instead of slowly destroying your property over weeks, months, or even years.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nThese alarms can often be combined with networked shutoff valves that will automatically turn off the water supply when a leak is detected. That way, even if you’re not home, the damage from a leak will be minimized.Moisture meterAs useful as leak alarms are, they can only help if present where a water leak occurs—and they only tell you that there’s water, not where the water is coming from. Sometimes the source will be obvious, of course—if the alarm placed near your toilet goes off, chances are good that it’s your toilet doing the leaking. But if the leak begins with a pipe in your wall, one tiny spot on a large roof system, or underground, you’ll need some help locating it.A moisture meter is a must-have for finding leaks. It’s a simple device that measures the amount of moisture trapped in a material, like drywall or flooring. By taking multiple readings throughout an area, you can pinpoint where the water is concentrated before you start tearing things open to effect a repair, saving you time and money.EndoscopesSometimes you need to see inside the spaces and voids of your home to find a water leak. If you suspect a pipe is leaking in the walls, for example, and you’re getting some confusing moisture meter readings, it might be time to reach for one of the most useful tools you’ll ever own: an endoscopic camera (aka, a borescope). This is a small, flexible camera that can be inserted into a small space and fished around, allowing you to see what’s behind a wall, under a floor, or inside a soffit in your home without ripping everything open. If there’s no obvious way to insert the camera, you can usually drill a small access hole that can be easily repaired later, and the video feed will let you inspect all those pipes to see where the water’s coming from.Pipe locatorA pipe locator is exactly what it sounds like: It locates the hidden pipes feeding water into and taking water out of your house, which are often inside walls, under floors, or buried underground. If you’re trying to figure out where a leaking pipe might be located, this tool can be invaluable, especially if other options haven’t worked.They’re not cheap—this one from Rigid is one of the more affordable options, and it’s about $1,800 at the time of this writing. But you can easily spend $1,000 or more if a plumber comes out to locate and fix your leaking pipe, so if you’re comfortable fixing the leak yourself, a tool like this will pay for itself eventually because you’ll be able to isolate the leak, turn off water to just that area, and effect the repair.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story\n        \n        \n            Lindsey Ellefson\n            \n            Features editor\n        \n        Get the latest smart home news, trends, and advice from Lindsey and the team.\n    \n    \n        Smarter Home & Living Newsletter\n            Never miss a story.

Another important—but perhaps more overlooked—element of the productivity process is the assessment, however. Reviewing what you did is just as integral as planning how you’ll do it—in reviewing, you get a chance to plan better (and improve!) for next time, while also carving out space to appreciate what you did well—also a major motivator!What is an after-action review? An after-action review, or AAR, is a way to measure the results of your performance and improve on your processes. It was first introduced by the U.S. Army to give units feedback after they had collective training exercises. The Army has actually released a ton of literature on it, but all you need to know is that when carried out right, it’s standardized, done the same way every time, and useful for building a framework that can enhance future labor. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nIf you do end up diving into that mountain of literature on the AAR, you’ll notice that it was designed for units or teams and is typically conducted by a facilitator who encourages members to discuss each part of the effort with the group. But it can be useful for individuals, too, since the process of completing an AAR is standardized and easy to follow. Build time into your schedule to conduct your own personal AAR after completing a major project, whether at work or in your personal life. You can complete it at the end of every week, or once you've finished a specific project. Either way, you'll want to keep notes of these reviews, whether in your planner or in a document you can add to a larger file about the project, like a single source of truth (SSOT). You may feel silly \"reviewing\" work you just completed, but the arguments for it—and the potential benefits—are substantial. First, if you're honest with yourself about what went wrong, you can figure out why the parts that didn't work were inefficient or ineffective, then seek solutions. In identifying what went well, you can set plans to replicate your process in the future, and find a little motivation in a job well done. An AAR (or something similar) is an integral part of many popular productivity techniques, including Getting Things Done and Agile Results. All the planning in the world doesn't matter if you never reflect on how it all went so you can improve next time around. What you should put into your after-action reviewThis is where we get into the rigid, structured process of the Army. There are four questions you’ll ask yourself when conducting your AAR and they’ll always be the same: What did I intend to accomplish?What did I do?Why did it happen the way it did?What will I do to change my strategy or execution for a better outcome next time OR how can I duplicate my success?Essentially, consider what you wanted to get done, what you actually got done, what impacted the outcome, and what you can take away for future attempts. Even running over this checklist in your head is a good practice, but writing it down is best, so you can refer back to it next time you’re in the planning stages on a new project. For instance, say you want to clean your kitchen. That’s the answer to the first question. What you really did, whether it was clean the kitchen, avoid the task, or only give it a half-effort, is the answer to the second. The third question is where you get introspective: If you did clean the kitchen, was it because you had company coming over and felt a sense of urgency, aligning your productivity with the Yerkes-Dodson Law? Or maybe it was because you needed to feel a sense of accomplishment after an otherwise unproductive week, but you were so burned out that you didn't do a great job. If you didn’t clean, was it because you felt overwhelmed? Did you get too busy? Did you lack the right tools for the job? Once you’ve established your reasons, you can build them into the answer to the fourth question, writing something like, “I will clean my kitchen weekly to make sure I’m always ready for unexpected company,” “I will follow a regimented cleaning method to avoid feeling overwhelmed,” or, “I will invest in better cleaning tools to make the next attempt go smoother.” When cleaning time rolls around again, you’ll pre-plan your actions as normal, scheduling out time for the activity and setting goals. Refer back to your AAR to refresh your memory on what went right and what went wrong the last time you tried to do the task. Eventually, you’ll smooth out the issues that are preventing you from being most efficient and get more results. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

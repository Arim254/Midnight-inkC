Whether you're walking outdoors or indoors, you can benefit from using guided walks to spice up your ambling. I love the walking video offered by Peloton, but I to access them, I pay $50 a month (though I get so much else as part of my subscription). But if you want a free option, there are some great ones on YouTube. They're similar to the free guided runs on the platform, but here, you just walk. (In general, if you want to find guided walking workouts on YouTube on your own, make sure to add \"outside\" or \"treadmill\" so you get results that will serve your needs.) Prowalk Tours (749,000 subscribers)\nFor \"walks\" around a specific location, Prowalk Tours might be the best out there. You can visit a variety of cities, markets, and locales from the comfort of your home or the gym. Running one of these on your phone or iPad while you use a treadmill is a great way to distract yourself and see what other parts of the world are like. There's no guidance, necessarily—at least not in an audio sense. This channel does divvy up the videos, though, so along the slider bar at the bottom of the player, you can see descriptions of the different areas you'll \"pass\" through. If there's a building you love in Paris, you can skip right to it. There are also other kinds of tours, like ones taken by boat and bike, so you can follow along on a stationary cycle or just watch and enjoy.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGet Fit With Rick (843,000 subscribers)\nI like this channel because it's much more exercise-focused, but still pretty chill—sometimes, you don't want to do Pilates or an all-out cardio session; you just want to walk. On the Get Fit With Rick channel, you can get motivation and pace cues, plus stretching and other movements (he might have you do some side-stepping or knee touches during a walk). Bear in mind he is stationary while he teaches, so you could actually just dance in place like he does, but you can—and should—walk around instead, hitting the beat of the music and keeping up with his pace cues. The variety of modifications available make this channel suitable for all levels. It's a great option if you're a beginner, having an active rest day, or just checking it out. The audio and video quality is high, which I always appreciate. You don't need incredible production values if the coaching is good, but it never hurts to actually be able to adequately hear and see the instructors.Sunny Health and Fitness (194,000 subscribers)\nYou might be familiar with Sunny if you've ever been scouring Amazon for cheap, at-home workout equipment. That was my first experience with the brand: I bought a tiny, mechanical elliptical from them that I used until I was able to get my own Peloton Bike. Their videos are like their products, in that they're straightforward and to the point, with no fuss or flare. They are geared specifically for walkers using treadmills, and offer pacing and form cues, plus motivation from a coach.IBX Running (59,000 subscribers)\nIBX appeared on my best YouTube running channels list too, because they offer so many options in terms of workout length and structure. One of the options? Just plain walking. The videos are abundant in volume, but more importantly, they're clear and useful: Side bars show you what your incline and pace should be, which many of the other channels don't do. This helps you stay motivated and work toward your fitness goals. Headspace (1 million subscribers)\nYou might be surprised to see Headspace here, since it's an app and platform dedicated to meditation and mental health, rather than exercise. But Headspace offers up some quality guided walking meditation videos I think are worth checking out. Exercise isn't just good for the body, but good for the mind, and sometimes, it's better to focus on that aspect, rather than just calorie burning. Think of them as guided walking meditations. If you want to take a stroll and be a little more mindful (while still reaping the physical benefits of moving around), start here. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Hell, even when you're alone at your desk, are you locked in on that spreadsheet or graphics project for eight straight hours, or might you be sipping a drink or texting your spouse every once in a while? There are simply some hours that aren’t true work hours, even if they occur during the work day. Times like these are known as idle time or downtime—but there’s a difference between the two, and understanding that can actually help you work smarter and be more productive.The difference between idle time and downtimeThese terms don’t just refer to the time experienced by people in the workplace; they also refer to—and come from—the tools we use to get our jobs done. The terms come from the tech world. Essentially, idle time is any time when an asset is waiting to run or isn’t scheduled to run, and downtime is when the asset can’t run, due to an outage or planned maintenance. For example, idle time happens when you’re waiting for your computer to boot up; downtime happens when the computer just won’t turn on. Outside of tech, idle time happens as you wait for a coworker to formulate a response to a question you asked, but downtime happens when they just don't respond and you're waiting in limbo, unable to work without their answer.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nSo, for people, idle time is nonproductive time that occurs when there’s a lack of demand or an unforeseen work stoppage. When you have all the tools you need available to you, but no reason to use them, you’re in idle time. If you’re working on a pitch deck, for instance, and need approval from a higher-up before you move forward on it, you’re idle while you wait for that approval, even though you could open the program to work on it. The reason you don't do that isn't that you don't have the tools; it's that you don't want to waste time doing it wrong.Downtime isn’t necessarily bad. Throughout the day, you need to take breaks from working. In fact, taking regular breaks makes you more productive, but that's more if you intend to take them, instead of having them foisted on you by someone or something else's failure to provide the tools you need. You can run into idle time that is caused by what corporate psychologists call “the dead-time effect,” which is when you’re overworked and stop being productive. In the productivity world, this is known as Illich's Law: The more you work without a break, the less productive you eventually get as the quality of your work declines. It’s better to pre-plan downtime than let idle time occur because of burnout. The trick to making idle and downtime work for you and your company is scheduling.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nScheduling around idle and downtimeDowntime can also occur when too many people are away from the office, say, on vacations or out sick. In that case, unlike idle time, a job can’t just be done whenever everything is ready, as the key tools—in this case, the people—are completely offline. To avoid losses from idle time and downtime, you need a solid scheduling plan. First, you should personally schedule around idle time. For instance, if you work in an environment that depends on the delivery of certain assets or products, pad time into your schedule to account for how long that might take. If it should take one day, leave padding for two, and fill up any idle slots with work you can accomplish without the shipment, if any. Use time boxing and time blocking, or the complete filling of your calendar, for this, and set two deadlines: the ideal date the shipment (or whatever you need) will be there, and a flexible time that you could still make work.For scheduling around downtime, make sure that you update your company-wide calendar whenever you’re going to be out and check for others’ outages when you’re making your personal schedule. Others’ downtime could lead to yours if you don’t account for the things you’ll need from them and get those before they’re gone. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Sure, third-party apps have filled this gap for many years now, but macOS itself didn't allow you to easily view multiple items stored in the clipboard, until now. With macOS 26 Tahoe, your Mac's Spotlight search has added support for clipboard history, which means that you can view pretty much everything you've copied in the past 30 days. Here's how to set up and use clipboard history on your Mac.How to enable clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nClipboard history is disabled by default on macOS Tahoe, so you'll have to activate it first. To do this, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's display and select System Settings. Now, go to Spotlight and scroll to the bottom in the right pane. Enable Results from Clipboard, and then click the drop-down menu below it. This lets you choose how long you want to store your clipboard history for. Apple gives you three choices: 8 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. Once you've made your choice, you'll be ready to use clipboard history on your Mac.If you copy sensitive items to the clipboard very often, you should probably avoid enabling this feature. I know many people who somehow still store passwords, credit card information, and other banking details in WhatsApp chats or plain text files. The moment you copy sensitive data from unsecured locations, it gets added to your clipboard history, which is not ideal. The good news is that if you copy passwords from Apple Passwords or other password management apps, they don't appear in your Mac's clipboard history.\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nAccessing and using clipboard history on your Mac\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nYou can access your Mac's clipboard history by using macOS Tahoe's Spotlight Search. First, copy a few items to your clipboard. These can be text, photos, or other files. Use the Command-Space keyboard shortcut (or click the magnifying glass in your Mac's top-right corner) to open Spotlight, and press Command-4. This will open your Mac's clipboard history, where you'll be able to see all the files you've copied recently.To see older items, scroll down. Next to each item, you'll see a small copy button, which you can use to copy that item to your clipboard once again. This is useful if you've copied multiple items in a row, but forgot to paste the first few. You can also select any item in your clipboard history list and press the return key on your keyboard to paste that item in the app that's in the foreground. If you want to quickly clear your clipboard history, fire up Spotlight (Command-Space), followed by the clipboard history page (Command-4), and select the three-dots button on the right. Select Clear History here to erase your entire clipboard. Or you can simply wait—Apple will automatically erase everything in your clipboard after your preset time limit (between 8 hours and 30 days, depending on what you chose in System Settings).Third-party clipboard management apps are better\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Pranay Parab\n                    \n    \nI'm aware that some people don't use Spotlight at all, in favor of better alternatives like Raycast or Alfred. Luckily, those apps come with built-in clipboard managers, too. Spotlight's implementation is good enough for basic use cases, but it needs a quicker way to access and paste from your clipboard history. While clipboard history in Spotlight is a nice upgrade, I still feel that if you're serious about clipboard management, third-party alternatives are the way to go. The best clipboard managers for Mac will allow you to sync your clipboard history across multiple devices, let you exclude certain apps from your clipboard history, filter clipboard items by type (links, text, images, etc.), copy multiple items and paste them sequentially (useful for filling repetitive forms), extract and copy text from images, and so much more. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

Just this morning, my smart rowing machine corrected my form (seems I need to drive more power from my legs, not my arms), while my Garmin watch told me to quit rushing my recovery between runs. Even as an AI-skeptic, I find myself listening to the robots on this front. The risk of improper technique is too great—so what's the harm in taking all the feedback I can get?The answer, like with so many things AI, is the gap between data and wisdom. So much wisdom gets lost—forfeited, even—when I blindly trust an AI coach to correct my form, and too great a reliance on this breed of fitness tech could quickly lead to more harm than good. Especially if \"injury-proofing\" is the latest fitness trend, it's important to spot the snake oil products merely trying to capitalize on the current moment. After all, the promise is seductive: let the algorithms protect you from yourself. The reality, according to experts, is considerably more nuanced.The promise of preventionConsider the range of tools now available to the average fitness enthusiast, all metrics you might now take for granted: Peloton bikes that track your output and warn when you're overtraining; WHOOP bands that measure recovery and readiness; Forme or Tonal smart mirrors that use AI to correct your exercise form in real-time; and apps like Strava that analyze your training load to prevent overuse injuries. Even simple smartphone apps claim to use your camera to assess whether you're squatting with proper knee alignment, or if your running gait shows injury-risk patterns.\nIn athletics especially, wearables that asses performance really can support injury prevention. By monitoring training load and overall health data, these devices offer potentially useful insights into an athlete's readiness and recovery that might otherwise be more of a guessing game.\"The data and analysis that can be provided here is incredible no doubt,\" says Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness. In many ways, the sensors don't lie about the metrics they measure. Your heart rate variability really did drop; your training load really is 40% higher than last week. That's valuable information.My rowing machine experience mirrors this. When the screen tells me my drive-to-recovery ratio is off, or that I'm pulling with my arms too early, I can immediately adjust. It's not the hands-on correction of a roaming yoga instructor physically repositioning my hips, but it's infinitely better than flailing around with no feedback at all.Where algorithms meet realityBut here's where the magic falters: knowing you're at risk and actually changing your behavior are entirely different things.\"The hard part is what to do with [the data],\" Weber explains. \"You have to think critically for your body to avoid injury. As you begin to incorporate tech with your training you will want to pair this with proper awareness, along with consistent recovery habits. Sleep and rest days are so important. Even if an application tells you that you have overtrained, it is up to you to not grind through another workout and rest.\" This is where I recognize myself all too clearly. How many times has my fitness tracker suggested a rest day and I've laced up for another run anyway? I've yet to pay the price in the form of an injury, and I know it's because my relationship with my body runs deeper than a wearable providing impersonal guidance. Still, the problem goes beyond simple stubbornness. I'm the type to override my watch and trust my body; I know way too many people who would override their body and trust their watch instead. And that trust is fundamentally misplaced. Dr. Dhara Shah, a doctor of physical therapy, notes that, \"risk prediction is complex because injuries are multi-factorial. Predicting injury risk involves technique, load, fatigue, recovery, readiness, previous injury history, biomechanics, environment, and other medical history. So, the technology may flag some risks, but it won't see everything.\" A wearable might notice your elevated resting heart rate and reduced heart rate variability, suggesting overtraining. But it can't know that you also just recovered from a cold, slept poorly because your neighbor's dog barked all night, and are about to do box jumps on a slippery gym floor while distracted by work stress. All injury risks. None visible to the algorithm.The gap between data and wisdomEven form correction technology faces its own limitations. Shah says that while form sensors can be, \"helpful in tracking progress over time and as visual feedback for patients,\" your personal interpretation remains crucial. \"Correcting form is still a human judgment,\" she adds. \"Detecting that form is off is one thing; prescribing exactly how to adjust for you (given your body, goals, constraints) is more complex and often still requires human judgment.\" Or, as Weber puts it: \"It is really important to remember that as fitness tech advances it is by no means a magic wand.\"My rowing machine can tell me I'm hunching my shoulders, but it can't see that I'm compensating for an old shoulder injury, or that my office chair has created postural habits that need addressing before my rowing form will truly improve. The screen shows symptoms; it doesn't diagnose root causes.And then there's the question of accuracy. \"Listen to your body and avoid relying solely on fitness devices when planning or performing workouts, as these devices are not always accurate,\" says Shah. Anyone who's watched their fitness tracker credit them with thousands of steps during an afternoon of hand-waving conversation knows this truth intimately.What AI can't replaceWhat really sets expert guidance apart isn't just knowledge—it's emotional intelligence and adaptive reasoning. Shah emphasizes that physical therapists bring something irreplaceable to injury prevention. \"The power of tactile feedback and analyzing subjective reports from the patient cannot be replaced,\" she says. \"Also, emotional intelligence: reading tone, frustration, fear, burnout, or overexcitement.\" Smart mirrors, heart straps, and fitness trackers are good at measuring, but we can't trust them to have clinical reasoning skills. Real, human physical therapists can read the story behind the numbers.\"Physical therapy isn't about following algorithms. It is personalized, adaptive, and effective,\" Shah says. A good trainer or physical therapist sees you favoring one leg and asks about last weekend's hike. They notice when enthusiasm has tipped into risky overconfidence, or when fear is causing you to move tentatively in ways that might cause different injuries. They adjust your program not just based on yesterday's heart rate data, but on how you describe your energy, your mood, how work is going, whether you winced when you sat down. The bottom line: AI is a bonus, not a replacementSo will fitness tech make us injury-proof? No. But that's asking the wrong question. The better question is: can fitness tech make us safer when combined with real human intelligence? The answer there is a cautious yes—if we treat these tools as partners, rather than prophets. Use the technology for what it does well (tracking metrics, identifying trends, providing immediate form feedback), but pair it with professional expertise for interpretation, personalization, and the kind of holistic assessment that only comes from human interaction. And if you're like me, remember to actually listen when the devices suggest rest.My rowing machine will keep nagging me about my form, and I'm grateful for it. But I've also started actually taking those suggested rest days seriously, and when it comes to my running career, I'm considering a visit to a physical therapist to address the root causes of my persistent issues with form. The technology can help guide me to my best ability, as I'd initially hoped, but it turns out my best ability requires more than just better sensors—it requires better judgment, too.The future of injury prevention isn't technology versus human expertise. It's technology amplifying human expertise, for those wise enough to seek both.\n            \n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

    "body": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n    \n        \n        The big shopping outlets are gearing up for another Black Friday sale season, and we’ll be on top of all those deals as they become available. Garmin announced several early Black Friday deals that are already live, and Google and Coros have now confirmed discounts on some of their wearables, too. In Google's case, it's a sale on Pixel Watch 4 and Fitbit devices, and Coros has announced a price drop on watches in its popular Pace line. To keep an eye on prices yourself, consider using these deal-tracking tools that can alert you as soon as the price drops, and that can show you the history of price changes when you think you've found a deal. (Our deals writer Daniel Oropeza, who compiled that list, considers CamelCamelCamel one of the best. My personal favorite is Keepa.)As Black Friday approaches, I’ll keep looking out for deals on fitness gear including fitness trackers and smartwatches, so let me give you a preview of what I’m expecting—and hoping—to see, plus the deals that are already live.  \nFitness trackers already on sale for Black FridayBlack Friday is still a couple weeks away, but the following devices are already discounted in early Black Friday deals. Coros Pace 3Coros doesn’t usually participate in big sale events, but the company just launched the Pace 4, which costs $249 and which performed excellently in my review. That means the Pace 3 gets a price drop—as of November 14, the Pace 3 is $199 instead of $229. I like the Pace 3 a lot as a simple but powerful running watch. Another watch to pay attention to is the Pace Pro, a big sister to the 3 and 4 with a larger screen and built-in maps. No other big-name watch gives you maps on a watch at this price point, and the Pace Pro is also dropping in price, to $299, instead of the previous price of $349. Note that Coros seems to be dropping these prices permanently, so this isn't just a Black Friday deal.Garmin Forerunner 165The 165 is Garmin’s modern entry-level watch. No offense to the 55, but it feels like a holdover from the past, as evidenced by the fact it’s four years old and has had to sit out two generations of newer models from the company. The 165 doesn’t feel outdated yet, though, and our resident marathoner Meredith Dietz loved the 165 Music. Its sibling, the 165 (same thing, just no offline music storage), made my list of the best affordable running watches.Because it comes in those two versions, you’ll want to pay attention to the differences. The music edition typically costs $50 more. Normally the version without music storage is $249, and the version with is $299. Earlier, I wrote that I'd keep an eye out for another drop to $199.99 like last year's Black Friday sale. Well, it's here! The Forerunner 165 is $199, and the Forerunner 165 Music is $249.99. Garmin Forerunner 265 (a surprise!)If I’m confusing you with all these model numbers, I have an explainer here that will help you follow along. In any case, the 265 and 965 are still good watches, and I wrote earlier that this year we might be able to expect more than $100 off for those two. It looks like my wish has come true—the 265 is now going for $299.99 ($150 off) and the 965 is $449.99 (also $150 off).The Black Friday deals I'm still hoping to seeMost of my predictions here are based on the sales I’ve seen from these models in the past. For devices that are new this year, I'm looking at last year's prices on the models that were new at the time. Most of the companies on my list have both newer and older models available. Here are the prices I’ll be looking for to know when I’ve found a great deal.Apple Watch Series 11: $329 or lowerLast year’s Series 10 watch dropped as low as $329 for Black Friday. This year, the Series 11 is the newest model (see our associate tech editor Michelle Ehrhardt’s take on it here). The base model has the same regular retail price of $399 as the Series 10 did last year, so a repeat of that discount seems likely. Apple’s “series” watches come in two sizes and two connectivity options, so I’m focusing on the smaller model without cellular. Expect larger sizes to cost $20 more and cellular to cost $100 more.So if all is equal, this year’s Black Friday should bring Series 11 deals of $329 or so. Lower would be great! It’s harder to know what to expect from the Series 10, since it’s older. But last year the older model (the Series 9) was available for $219 as a Black Friday deal, so I’d keep an eye out for similarly steep discounts on the 10 this year. Pixel Watch 4: $279 or lowerThe newest version of Google’s Pixel Watch is the 4, which I reviewed here. Google has confirmed that a sale will begin Nov. 20 that will let buyers \"save up to $100 on Pixel Watch 4.\" This watch sells for prices from $349.99 to $499.99 so that suggests sale prices of $249.99 to $399.99 depending on whether you opt for the larger or smaller size, with cellular connectivity or without.\n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nWhile we wait for the exact prices, I'll tell you what I expect based on past sales. In 2024, the Pixel Watch 3 dipped down to $279 for Black Friday, from a regular price of $349, so I would expect something similar for the 4 this year. The Pixel Watch 4 is currently at the same starting point of $349 and up. As with the Apple Watch, I’m quoting numbers for the smaller, non-cellular model. The larger size costs $50 more and cellular capabilities cost $100 more.If you’re interested in buying the older model, you’re already in luck. As I write this, the some colors of the Pixel Watch 3 are on sale for $199.99, $100 off the usual price. If last year’s sales on the Pixel Watch 2 are any indication, the 3 might drop as low as $145.Garmin Forerunner 970: $699 or lowerGarmin’s 970 and 570 have never been on a real sale yet; both were launched earlier this year. The 970, with maps and an LED flashlight, has a retail price of $749. The 570, which is missing those two features but is still an excellent higher-end running watch, sits at $549. Will Black Friday bring the first sales for these watches? I think there’s a good chance of it, but I’m not expecting a huge discount. Last year, the previous models—the 265 and 965—were both $100 off, but they were a year and a half old at that point. Go back two years, to when they were newer, and the discount was more like $50. Garmin Forerunner 55: $149 or lowerGarmin’s Forerunner 55 is its most basic running watch, which I have mixed feelings about. It’s missing a lot of features that other entry-level Garmin Forerunners, like the 165, have as a matter of course. But it does great at the basic job of tracking your runs, and I’ve always felt that if Garmin could get it closer to $99, I’d sing its praises from the rooftops. It’s never dropped quite that low, though. The original sticker price was $199.99, and it’s often sitting somewhere around $169.99. As of today, it's equaling the lowest price I've seen in the past, $149.99. This watch isn’t getting any younger, and I think if Garmin’s smart, it'll consider a steeper price drop this Black Friday. Fitbit Charge 6: $99 or lower Google has confirmed that the Fitbit Charge 6 will be available for $99.95 starting Nov. 20. This device has a sticker price of $159.95, but often sells for a good bit less, and occasionally drops down near $100. When I first wrote up my predictions earlier this month, the Charge 6 was already down to $99.95—but that seems to have been a temporary drop, since it's back up to $128.95 as I write this.With this low price coming so early in November, I wondered whether a Black Friday deal might drop it even further—but it seems Google is hinting that $99.95 is as low as it's going to get. The Charge 6 isn’t the best one out there, but it fits the bill of an “I don’t want to think about it” basic tracker. If you just want to track your steps without overthinking which model to get, this is a fine pick. \n            ",

That's why I've recommended it a lot in the past and why it regularly appears on best-of lists of productivity methods. It's simple: Set a timer for 25 minutes (or use a specially designed app) and work on a task for that amount of time, then take a five-minute break before setting the timer and working again. After four 25-minute cycles, you get a longer break. In theory, this keeps you both motivated and clear-headed.Beloved as it is, it doesn't work for everyone. Nothing does. But don't lose hope. You can—and should!—modify it to fit your needs. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nWhy the Pomodoro technique works—and why it sometimes doesn'tThe idea behind Pomodoro is a good one. Generally, two factors dramatically improve productivity: Taking periodic breaks and diving into focused, deep work on one task without doing a bunch of other stuff at the same time. Since focused work and breaks are built into this technique, it can push you to get a lot done in those 25-minute bursts, whether you're grinding away on a work project, studying for a test, cleaning the house, or answering emails. Sinking into the zone of \"deep work\" is easier for some people than others, though, which is why Pomodoro fans sometimes report that the 25-minute allotments just aren't enough. In other cases, 25 minutes may be too long for knocking out simple tasks, leading you to get distracted. Just because something is considered the gold standard doesn't mean it works at the gold-medal level for everybody. There are times when you can't work, for instance, and you're forced into a period of inactivity (which you should embrace). Other times, it's a lack of motivation, not resources, that stalls you. For me, whether Pomodoro works in its standard format is dependent entirely on what I'm doing and engaged I am. Some people can lock in for 25 minutes on even the most tedious task, but I am not one of them. In fact, when it comes to productivity, the approach that works best for me is the two-minute rule, or doing something the moment I think of it. Today, I had to do a uniquely unpleasant cleaning task. The urge hit me at 7 a.m., so I got right to it; had I been preoccupied with a set schedule, I would have procrastinated. I couldn't have done that task for a sustained 25 minutes, but I was able to chip away in five- and 10-minute blocks with gratuitous Instagram breaks in between. Instead of getting down on myself for being unable or unwilling to follow the most tried-and-true structure in the productivity world, I was proud of myself for doing the thing, no matter what the process looked like. Give yourself similar grace as you endeavor to modify Pomodoro to suit your needs, even if they differ from task to task. How to modify the Pomodoro techniqueDon't toss out the concept altogether if you're not finding it effective for you. Instead, modify it. I recommend spending a few weeks diligently tracking your time. You can use time-tracking software or a plain old spreadsheet, but as you're working through your to-do list, keep notes on when you feel like you've entered a deep work phase. You'll know it's happening when working is feeling smooth, you're not distracted by anything, and time is flowing by as you're getting results. Also keep track of when you start to feel distracted, as well as how much you actually got done at the end of each 25-minute Pomodoro set. Finally, keep track of how you feel during and after your break times. Doing all this helps you with a concept called \"flowtime,\" also known as \"flowmodoro.\" There's more to it than that, but tracking your work time, and the feelings you experience during it, is the first step.After a few weeks, go through your data and look for patterns. Did you struggle to get into the zone when cleaning your kitchen every time that task came up? Did you find you only hit a \"deep work\" phase 15 minutes into your work time, leaving you with only 10 minutes to truly get things done before your timer went off? Did you feel ready for a break when one rolled around, or did you spend your five minutes of off time distracted by everything you still had to do? Did you feel rejuvenated when it was time to get back to work or was the idea unappealing? Ideally, you should be in a flow state for those 25 minutes, be able to enjoy your break time with little anxiety, and feel eager to get back to being productive when it's time to reset the timer. If those things aren't true, you can modify the technique. If it takes you longer to get into the zone, give yourself more work time. If you can't get comfy during your breaks, make those longer. As you make adjustments, keep tracking your time, feelings, and output until you find a work-break balance that works. For an example of how one person managed this, consider animedoro, a Pomodoro spin-off invented by a college student who sought to work longer so he could take breaks long enough to finish an episode of anime. Using your own personal motivators as a guide can be helpful.Again, the core tenets of this technique—focused work and consistent breaks—are proven to be effective for productivity. It's the 25-minute blocks that can be a little subjective and arbitrary; that part is just based on what worked for the guy who invented this, so if he could pick time blocks that worked for him, why can't you? As long as you're committed to doing deep work and giving yourself breaks, it doesn't actually matter how long you're allotting for yourself to do either. Just keep in mind that working too long can make you unproductive, so do try not to give yourself too much time there. \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?\n        \n        \n            Jordan Calhoun\n            \n            Editor in chief\n        \n        Get daily tips, tricks, and tech guides from Jordan and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Daily Newsletter\n            Ready to do everything better?

Sora, the company's short-form AI video generator, is already tricking people across social media with hyperrealistic AI slop. I fear we've already reached a point where it's too difficult to trust that what you seen on your feeds is actually real.But today, we're taking a break from the AI video doom, and returning our attention back to OpenAI's flagship product. On Wednesday, the company announced the latest versions of GPT, the model that power ChatGPT: GPT-5.1 Instant, and GPT-5.1 Thinking. OpenAI says Instant is the company's most-used model, but is \"now warmer, more intelligent, and better at following your instructions.\" Thinking, on the other hand, is the company's reasoning model, and is both faster and \"easier to understand\" with simple tasks, as well as more \"persistent\" on complex requests.It seems like mostly minor updates to me, but here's what's new, according to OpenAI:\n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nGPT-5.1 InstantLet's take a look at Instant first. OpenAI claims the model is \"surprisingly\" playful. For the prompt \"I'm feeling stressed and could use some relaxation tips,\" OpenAI shows two sample answers for GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 Instant, respectively: GPT-5: \"Here are a few simple, effective ways to help ease stress — you can mix and match depending on how you’re feeling and how much time you have.\"  GPT-5.1 Instant: \"I’ve got you, Ron — that’s totally normal, especially with everything you’ve got going on lately. Here are a few ways to decompress depending on what kind of stress you’re feeling.\"I can see the differences, of course: GPT-5 is a bit more serious in tone, while 5.1 offers that classic AI overly friendly approach, and makes sure to include the user's name. How human. But scrolling through the rest of the comparison, I'm not so sure I see a huge difference. Both break down their various suggestions into bullet points, though 5.1 occasionally includes more flowery language like \"bonus points.\"Another change OpenAI touts is improved instruction following. The presented examples show the user prompting the bot with the request \"Always respond with six words.\" GPT-5 follow suit for its first response, but when asked where the user should travel to this summer, the bot completely ignores the six-word answer mandate, and offers a full response instead. GPT-5.1, on the other hand, keeps up the bit throughout the exchange, regardless of how complex the questions become. I get that it's just an example, but why would someone need their bot to follow such an odd request? I suppose it implies that GPT-5.1 will maintain your original instructions throughout an interaction, but if so, why not show an application where that's actually useful? I'd rather receive a fuller answer to important questions than have all responses be exactly six words.  Finally, OpenAI says that Instant can still tap into reasoning models when appropriate, while still generating quick results. The company doesn't get into it much, but they must have tweaked something in the algorithm that lets the model \"think\" over complex suggestions, without going so deep that the response takes too long.  GPT-5.1 ThinkingGPT-5.1 Thinking is a direct upgrade to the existing GPT-5 Thinking model. Like GPT-5.1 Instant, OpenAI says the model can adjust its processing according to the task at hand. In theory, that means 5.1 Thinking can respond to simpler prompts more quickly, while taking more time \"thinking\" through complicated tasks. OpenAI claims that GPT-5.1 Thinking is about twice as fast when responding to the \"fastest tasks\" and twice as slow on the \"slowest tasks\" when compared to GPT-5, when both models are set to Standard.OpenAI says 5.1 Thinking uses less specialized language, and doesn't necessarily assume you understand complex terms. The company shows an example of someone asking the bot to explain BABIP and and wRC+ (Batting Average on Balls in Play and Weighted Runs Created Plus, respectively). GPT-5's explanation includes abbreviations, formulas, and insider concepts that I certainly wouldn't pick up as someone who knows next to nothing about baseball. The 5.1 Thinking result, on the other hand, spells out those abbreviations, walks the user through the formulas instead of simply displaying them, and goes into more detail about certain complex topics. I can see how that would offer some improvements in clarity, even though you always need to watch out for hallucinations. Sure, it's great to make responses more clear, but that won't help if the responses themselves are completely inaccurate.Adjusting ChatGPT's tone\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: OpenAI\n                    \n    \nAs part of these new models, OpenAI is changing the way you customize ChatGPT's tone and style. The new Personalization options include the usual \"Default\" tone, but \"Listener\" is now called \"Friendly,\" while \"Robot\" is now \"Efficient.\" (Perhaps GPT took offense to the latter.) OpenAI says these options all have updates, but doesn't specify what those are. In addition, you have new options to choose from as well. These include \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); and \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative). Lastly, the company says it is currently testing a new settings option that lets you fine-tune the tone and style of the bot to your liking, but is launching the experiment with a limited pool of users only. What else is newOpenAI says that by default, you won't need to choose between these two models: GPT-5.1 Auto will decide which model makes sense for you based on your query. That's been the case since the company launched GPT-5, though paid subscribers can still manually choose their model. Speaking of paid subscribers, GPT-5.1 is rolling out first to Pro, Plus, Go, and Business users. The company started shipping the model on Wednesday, and says it will gradually appear over the next few days. The model will arrive to free and logged-out users soon, though there's no specific timeline yet. Paid subscribers will also have access to GPT-5 for three months, as OpenAI takes it time winding down the older model. The company likely doesn't want to repeat the issues caused when it immediately removed models like GPT-4o and older from ChatGPT, as users who were quite literally attached to the model were upset to lose it. OpenAI is careful to note that GPT-5's sunsetting period has no impact on existing legacy models like 4o, which are still available for the time being. For a new update to GPT, this really isn't all that flashy. Maybe that's a good thing: OpenAI overhyped GPT-5, which was a let down for many fans of GPT-4o—especially when the company subsequently took that model away. Keeping expectations in check for GPT-5.1 is likely a smart move, but I can't help but wonder if it's a sign that AI advancements are starting to slow down. We know AI companies are running out of data to train their models on, we just don't know how soon the impacts will be felt. GPT-5.1 probably isn't a harbinger of doom for OpenAI, but it is interesting that it isn't an exponential improvement, either.Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.  \n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

    "body": "\n        \n        Holiday shopping season is ripe for scammers, as consumers rush to find and take advantage of some of the best discounts of the year, and potentially overlook red flags that signal fraud. Security researchers are warning of an uptick in scams capitalizing on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype. Fraudsters know that they can prey on shoppers' sense of urgency and excitement for limited-time, exclusive deals—and AI is making these campaigns even more difficult to spot than usual. New data from McAfee suggest that nearly half of Americans have come across an AI-powered scam while shopping, from deepfakes impersonating celebrities pushing promotions to near-flawless spoofed websites that steal your credit card information. Here are the scams to watch for this Black Friday. \nSpoofed websites are a common type of a scam, and fraudsters use holiday shopping season to trap users with fake retail sites and sales pages that look legitimate but are actually just collecting data like your login credentials and payment information. Scammers will use stolen assets like logos and product photos from known and trusted brands, and AI makes it easy to set up a convincing (but fake) small business website with elements like a customer service page and consumer reviews in no time. Another shopping scam facilitated by AI is the impersonation scam. You think you're watching a popular influencer or celebrity promoting an exclusive deal or product giveaway on TikTok or another social media platform, but it's actually a deepfake. If you click through to enter or buy, you'll land on a counterfeit page (as outlined above) designed to steal from you. According to Google's November fraud and scam advisory, scammers can get eyes on their content by hijacking search terms for Black Friday sales, running deceptive ads, or pushing deals on social media. Fake storefronts may appear as sponsored links, which are easy to overlook if you're in a rush to make a purchase. Of course, you may encounter other common holiday scams, such as fake shipping notifications that request payment in order to resolve a delivery issue as well as account verification scams that prompt you to confirm personal details. These phishing and smishing campaigns use standard scam tactics like impersonating a legitimate company or service and sending a fraudulent link that collects your bank information or username and password combination. \n            \n                What do you think so far?\n            \n        \nBlack Friday scam red flags When shopping holiday deals, slow down enough to look for common signs of scams. Fraudsters will use urgency—such as a limited time to secure a deal or a limited number of items left in stock—in hopes you won't think before you buy. You should also be wary of any deal that is too good to be true, or a promotion with especially low prices that are out of line with other sales on similar items. This includes influencers pushing \"exclusive\" opportunities. If you are purchasing from a small business you don't know, google the brand and read third-party reviews to see whether it is legitimate. Instead of clicking links from emails, texts, and social media posts promoting sales, go directly to the retailer's website and search for the deal. If you do click through, check the URL carefully to ensure it is legitimate (scammers may use homoglyphs that avoid detection at first glance) and look for website elements that real companies have, such as a privacy policy and address. If you see a promotion on social media, check the creator's account to see when they joined the platform, what they've posted in the past, and whether they are verified. Beware of any site that requires you to pay with a gift card, cryptocurrency, or bank transfer versus a credit card, which has some protection in the case of fraud. Legitimate retailers will use legitimate payment methods. Finally, never enter your login credentials unless you've confirmed that the site you're using is trustworthy. This includes delivery services and your Amazon and PayPal accounts, all of which scammers may pressure you to \"verify\" in order to resolve a billing or delivery issue. \n            ",

With it, you can install a number of applications in just a couple of clicks, as opposed to downloading a bunch of individual installers. Ninite is well known for simplicity, too. There's no package manager to learn or commands to type; just visit the website and pick the apps you want to install, then download and run the installer. Installations all run in the background, with no prompts. It's magical, and I've long wondered why Microsoft hasn't built anything similar—something powerful, yet easy to use. Well, it seems like someone at the company finally got around to it. A new Microsoft site called App Pack is exactly this. It allows you to visit a page on the Microsoft Store website, check from a selection of applications, and then install those applications by downloading and running a single installer. That's exactly how Ninite works, though there are a few differences between these two options.\n    \n            \n            \n                                        Credit: Justin Pot\n                    \n    \nThe main difference is that Microsoft's App Pack uses the Microsoft Store to install the applications, and the installer you download instructs the store to make the downloads. This means updates will also be handled by the store, which is a real benefit, but it also means the supported applications are limited to those offered in the store. That's part of why Ninite offers a lot more software. App Pack offers 32 applications in four categories; Ninite offers over 90 distinct applications in all sorts of categories. \n        \n            You May Also Like\n        \n    \nBut there's also the Microsoft of it all. You cannot use App Pack to install Chrome, which isn't in the Microsoft Store. But you also can't use it to install Firefox, which is. Given that one of the first things many Windows users do is replace Edge, that's a real shortcoming; given that Microsoft seems to really want Windows users not to replace Edge, it's not surprising. Meanwhile, Ninite lets you install Chrome and Firefox, as well as other browsers like Opera, Brave, and, ironically, Edge. But it's not as though App Pack only offers Microsoft software. Zoom is offered, as are several apps from Apple (iCloud, Music, and TV). There are desktop apps for all the big social media networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and LinkedIn). And there are a few customization tools, including TranslucentTB for customizing the taskbar and F.lux for adjusting the color temperature of your display. There are also multiple apps for working in media, including Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio. It's just that Ninite offers more, including power user staples like VLC, WinDirStat, 7-Zip, and Handbrake. If you don't need these additional apps, however, App Pack is a diverse set of tools, and I could imagine the one-click install saving a lot of time for many Windows users. You can find it here or by clicking the \"Multi-app install\" button in the top-right corner of the web version of the Microsoft Store.\n            \n    \n\n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story\n        \n        \n            Jake Peterson\n            \n            Senior tech editor\n        \n        Get the latest tech news, reviews, and advice from Jake and the team.\n    \n    \n        The Download Newsletter\n            Never miss a tech story.

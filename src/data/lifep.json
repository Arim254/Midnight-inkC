A great example of this: the Von Restorff effect, which refers to our brains’ acuity for remembering distinctive pieces of information over more uniform ones, a fact discovered by a German psychiatrist named Hedwig von Restorff. It’s an interesting fact of biology, but it can also be very useful to know when you’re studying a difficult concept. Here’s why, and how to put the Von Restorff effect to good use.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-von-restorff-effect\">What is the Von Restorff effect?</h2><p>In previous articles, I’ve discussed various memory effects you can capitalize on when you study, like the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-primacy-effect-can-help-you-remember-informat-1850432109\" target=\"_blank\">primacy effect</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-the-proust-effect-can-help-you-study-1850749025\" target=\"_blank\">Proust effect</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-production-effect-to-study-more-effectively-1850915123\" target=\"_blank\">production effect</a>. All of these begin with a nice, a round-looking “P\" and the consonant blend of \"Pr-.\" If I add the Von Restorff effect to that list, it will stand out solely because of the variety in its name—the rigid angle of that “V\" and the hard sound of the Restorff. Because of this, you’re more likely to remember the Von Restorff effect when asked to name the four memory phenomena we just went over—and <em>that’s </em>the Von Restorff effect in action.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the simplest terms, it is an “isolation effect” that ensures your brain will remember an item in a list if it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other entries on the list. When studying, you can achieve this effect by changing the meaningfulness of an item or a piece of information in some way, whether by color, size, font choice, or another approach.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-von-restorff-effect-to-remember-what-you-study\">How to use the Von Restorff effect to remember what you study</h2><p>The good news is that, unlike when you try to harness the power of other memory-based study techniques, this one is pretty straightforward. It's almost too simple, which is why you might not be familiar with it or ever have considered finding ways to use it. Once you realize the simplicity of this concept, it’s easy to find ways to work it into your study habits. </p><ul><li><p>In your notes, use a highlighter specifically to highlight words or concepts you need to remember for a test. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-color-code-your-notes-for-better-recall\" target=\"_blank\">Color-coding your notes</a> is a supremely helpful studying technique on its own because even taking the time to choose the colors and their meanings helps you focus. </p></li><li><p>When using flashcards, write concepts and words you’re having a hard time grasping in a different color. If you're using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner method</a> (which you should be), you can rewrite or recreate cards every time you drill them. With that technique, you move your cards into piles every time you get them right or wrong, then study the piles at different frequencies, focusing on ones you know less often than ones that are giving you trouble. Every few times you move a card up or down into a pile, try rewriting or recreating it with a different text color. If a card is red but your color for easy ones is blue, you'll be instantly reminded that this is one you recently struggled with, which can help you lock in and pull the information from your memory using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">active recall</a>. </p></li><li><p>When studying with others and talking through the material (or reading aloud from your notes), try associating a unique motion—like a specific hand gesture—with the concepts you’re discussing. </p></li><li><p>Use a shape, like a circle or box, to outline key parts of your notes or textbook materials. Do this when you're mind-mapping, especially, so all your mind maps are uniform. Dates can be in squares, vocab words in circles, and so on. To make quick and efficient mind maps, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">an app like Xmind</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also when <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-a-mind-map-to-increase-your-productivity-1850641534\" target=\"_blank\">mind-mapping</a>, move the circle containing the most important concepts (or the one you’re struggling to grasp) to a more removed part of your page, differentiating it from the rest of the clusters visually. I do a version of this with my to-do list, which is written on a whiteboard on the fridge. Unusual things, like a doctor's visit or something I need to buy but don't usually get on my weekly trip to the grocery store, get written off to the side. They're more notable that way, drawing my attention away from the larger block of text and reminding me, over and over, that I have to do them. By the time doctor's appointment day rolls around or I'm in the store trying to remember my list, those are seared into my brain. </p></li><li><p>If you're revising your notes, use different text styles. This is something I did all the time in college, even when taking notes in class. I would bold anything a professor led into by announcing, \"This will be on the test.\" I would turn vocab words purple. Even if you're hand-writing (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">which you should be!</a>), you can draw squiggly underlines under certain ideas, circle others ... you get the point. Get zany with it, but keep it uniform. If you draw a big box around one date, do it to all of them. If you draw arrows pointing to a state law and a circle around a federal one, do it to all of them. </p></li></ul><p>The goal is to differentiate the things you need or struggle to remember using color, motion, shape, or even orientation. Setting certain ideas or words apart will make them stick in your brain better, no matter how you do it. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>",

The problem is that sometimes, you can miss the forest for the trees, skimming passages just to get it all over with. To get to that broad understanding you need, you should use a method that is all about being detail-oriented. It’s called “close reading,” and it will help you grasp whatever you read so you understand not only your assigned passage or chapter, but the concept you're studying overall.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-close-reading\">What is close reading?</h2><p>Close reading is a method that requires you to focus on every detail in a text and operate on the assumption that no detail is in there by accident or for no reason. That's not an assumption so much as it's a fact. Think about the process required for that content to be in front of you. A subject matter expert had to research it all, write it all down, pass it through perhaps an agent and definitely an editor, if not multiple editors. If it's for school, that material had to be reviewed by some kind of board and approved for use. Everything that made it to the final version had multiple sets of eyes on it. All of it is important and deserves to be there; anything irrelevant would likely have been cut. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/oPrXY?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Teaching%20Literature&short_url=oPrXY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fuse-close-reading-to-retain-every-detail-when-you-study&event_label=Teaching%20Literature\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>Teaching Literature</em></a>, literary critic Elaine Showalter says that “close reading” is “slow reading, a deliberate attempt to detach ourselves from the magical power of storytelling and pay attention to language, imagery, allusion, intertextuality, syntax, and form.” The idea is to break the habit of reading casually or taking everything in at once and instead form a new habit wherein you examine every tiny element of what you’re reading and question why the author included it.</p><p>The method is even included in the <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED541436.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">United States’ Common Core standards for K-12 education</a>. There, it’s defined as “the methodical investigation of a complex text through answering text dependent questions geared to unpack the text’s meaning.” </p><p>Essentially, you’re not just looking at what the text says, but <em>how </em>it says it—and that’s beneficial: <a href=\"https://litinfocus.com/4-major-benefits-close-reading/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Per Literacy in Focus</a>, that means you’ll eventually be able to truly grasp what the text <em>means</em>. <a href=\"https://fisherpub.sjf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1238&context=education_ETD_masters\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Educators have researched</a> the use of the method and found it increases reading comprehension, for instance. Using close reading helps learners understand what a text says, but also why it’s important. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-close-reading-method\">How to use the close reading method</h2><p>Close reading involves reading everything twice (or more than twice). The first time is to get what it says, but the following times are to understand why it says it and why it says it <em>that way</em>. The goal is to be able to apply that deeper thinking and understanding to what you learned the first time through.</p><h3>Read for understanding</h3><p>On your first pass through the material, just get the gist. Figure out the main argument or story, who is speaking, and to whom. Don't worry about details. Just take it all in and make a mental note of what stands out, confuses or, or seems relevant.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Read for details</h3><p>On your second time through the content, you'll actually do the \"close reading\" part. Highlight key terms, circle new words, and look all of those those up. Pay special attention to formatting, like subtitles, section breaks, and visuals like charts or photos. Remember: None of it is in there by accident. Think, too, about how the information is ordered. Does the author start broad, describing an issue before zeroing in on examples? Or do they start with a specific example and <em>then</em> explain broader context? </p><h3>Ask questions</h3><p>Read it again, but this time, ask questions. Write them down on a separate paper or even in the margins. It's likely you'll be reading something digital, so just open up a blank word processing doc if you have to. Some questions to ask, though these will vary depending on your content, grade level, author, and more:</p><ul><li><p>Why is this section titled the way it is?</p></li><li><p>Why did the author use that [evocative/obscure/flippant/etc.] word?</p></li><li><p>Why introduce this idea before that one?</p></li><li><p>Why did the author start the chapter with a character-driven story before explaining the broader context? </p></li><li><p>Who is the intended audience? Students? Educators? The general public? Plumbers? Politicians? </p></li></ul><p>Crucially, ask questions even—or especially—if you're unsure of the answer. Maybe you <em>don't</em> know why the author used a particular phrase or for whom the content was written. That doesn't matter. By asking, you become more curious and think more deeply. It keeps you engaged. </p><h3>Read for meaning</h3><p>Once you've read it enough times that you've identified the main idea and found some questions to ask, you've made it to your final read-through. Here, zoom out. Stop thinking of individual words, unusual punctuation, or why the author included a particular graph. Think instead of the bigger picture again, like you did on that first read-through. What's the author's purpose? How do the things you noticed the second time through or the questions you asked the third time through contribute to that message? </p><p>Maybe a recurring reference in a short story hints at a theme. Maybe the structure of an essay is meant to mirror the thoughts of its subject. That's what this exercise is about. You're moving beyond <em>what</em> the text says and understanding <em>how</em> it's delivering its message. Obviously, this is a useful practice when studying literature, but it works for a variety of subjects. If you're reading history, you might wonder why an author frames a particular battle or policy in a negative or positive way and wonder, too, how the people on the other side of that battle or policy felt—and why their view isn't represented. Even asking those questions gets you thinking deeper and relating more to the material, which makes it not only easier to understand, but easier to remember. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

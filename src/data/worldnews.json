    "body": "1 hour agoMimi SwabyGlobal affairs reporterAt least 64 people were killed in a police operation against the Red Command gang in Rio de Janeiro's northern suburbs - the largest and deadliest raid in the Brazilian state's history.Four police officers were among those killed during Operation Containment in the Alemão and Penha districts, state Governor Cláudio Castro said. More than 80 people were arrested.Fierce clashes erupted when about 2,500 security personnel moved in on Tuesday morning. The Red Command (Comando Vermelho) responded with gunfire, burning barricades and dropping bombs from drones, officials said. The UN Human Rights Office said it was \"horrified\" by the police operation, urging \"prompt and effective investigations\".The area of favelas near Rio's airport is considered to be the headquarters of one of Brazil's most powerful organised crime groups.State officials said at least 50 of those killed were \"indicated by police as suspected of being criminals\".Dozens of people were injured, including civilians caught in the crossfire.Locals have likened the hillside area - home to about 300,000 people - to a \"war zone\" since the operation began.Roads remain closed throughout the region.The Red Command group have been expanding their territory across the Rio state, increasing drug trafficking routes and control of the hillside favelas.Rio's police said more than 200kg (441lb) of drugs were seized in the raid, along with dozens of firearms.The joint operation by civil and military police comes after a year-long investigation.Dozens of the suspects are thought to be members of a faction from the Pará state who are currently hiding in Rio de Janeiro.Large-scale police operations are not uncommon in Brazil ahead of major international events in the South American nation. The UN climate summit COP30 is taking place in the northern city of Belem in November.",

    "body": "Australian authorities are investigating after an 80-year-old woman who was left behind on a Great Barrier Reef island by a cruise ship was found dead.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250 km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found the woman's body on Sunday morning.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said it is investigating and will meet the ship's crew when it docks in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for AMSA said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time on Saturday (05:00 GMT on Friday) by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff have contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Fifield said.The elderly Australian woman is understood to have joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 local time with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told the ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"Ayris said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"It is understood the woman was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Queensland police said a report will be prepared for the coroner in the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman.

    "body": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the makers of Tylenol, claiming the companies hid alleged dangers that the drug posed to children's brain development. The lawsuit comes a month after President Donald Trump promoted an unproven link between taking Tylenol - also known as paracetamol - during pregnancy and autism in children.  Paxton is suing Johnson & Johnson, which previously sold the drug, the only pain reliever recommended for pregnant women, and Kenvue, which now manufacturers it.  In a statement, he said they \"betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks.\"Kenvue says there is no credible evidence tying Tylenol to autism.\"These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,\" Paxton, a Republican, said.Kenvue said in a statement that it was \"deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children\".On its website, Kenvue also said it had \"continuously evaluated the relevant science and there is no credible data that shows a proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism\". Organizations representing doctors and healthcare providers agree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said acetaminophen - the main ingredient in Tylenol - is one of the few options for pregnant women to treat pain and fever, which can pose serious health risks if left untreated. \"In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children,\" the group said. The lawsuit cites recent announcements from the Trump administration in arguing the drug is allegedly unsafe.Last month, Trump raised alarms from public health officials when he told pregnant women to \"fight like hell\" not to take Tylenol when ill. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a notice that doctors should consider limiting the use of Tylenol, while also stating that \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and autism in children has not been established. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who oversees the FDA, had pledged in April to undertake \"a massive testing and research effort\" that would determine the cause of autism in a matter of months. But experts cautioned that finding a single cause of autism - thought by researchers to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors - would not be simple. Autism is a form of lifelong neurodivergence and disability that affects how people experience and interact with the world, and is diagnosed using doctors' observations.In his court filing, Paxton - a Trump ally who is running for US Senate - alleges Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson \"willfully ignored and attempted to silence the science\" around acetaminophen and autism. The lawsuit seeks to make the companies \"destroy any marketing or advertising\" that claims Tylenol is safe for pregnant women. The Texas lawsuit echoes the complaints of a group of parents of children with autism and ADHD who sued the makers of Tylenol in 2022.  A federal judge dismissed the case, saying research from the parents' expert witnesses was not conclusive. ",

    "body": "A statue of a Confederate general that was torn down and set on fire in 2020 during social justice protests in Washington has been reinstalled under orders from President Donald Trump. General Albert Pike's statue has long been a source of controversy, as have many Confederate monuments across the US which were erected decades after the Civil War.The National Park Service announced in August its plan to return the refurbished statue, after Trump signed an executive order called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\".Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, called the restoration  “offensive to members of the military who serve honorably”.On Monday afternoon,  videos showed the area surrounding Pike's statue in Washington with a sign that read  \"Area close. Historic preservation work in progress\". \"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and restore pre-existing statues,\"  the National Park Service in a statement.These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they're the centre of a new art showThe statue, which was built in 1901, has been a source of controversy for many years. Members of local government have been calling for its removal for decades. Holmes Norton, a long-time critic, has introduced legislation to remove the Pike statue permanently multiple times. \"Pike himself served dishonourably,\" she said in a statement after the statue was restored. \"He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops.\"\"Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor,\" Holmes Norton added. Pike's statue was the only monument to a Confederate general in the nation's capital before it was pulled down in 2020.Pike was a longtime leader of the Freemasons, a centuries-old secretive society, who paid for the statue. His body is interred at the Washington headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also contains a small museum in his honour.Pike's critics have accused him of being instrumental in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan. Masons insist that evidence doesn't support the allegations.The plaque that previously labelled the statue read \"author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher\". Anti-racism protesters used ropes and chains to pull down the Pike statue following the murder of  George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a police officer in 2020.Then-President Trump, in his first term, condemned the toppling on Twitter, writing: \"The DC police are not doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our country.\"Floyd's death ignited a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, prompting widespread calls to remove Confederate monuments. Ultimately, more than 300 such memorials were taken down across the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has ordered statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled. ",

    "body": "A man accused of killing former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, told a court in the capital Tokyo that \"everything is true\", according to local media. Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara in 2022.Abe - who was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\" - was struck several times, and died in hospital later the same day, sending shockwaves around the world.The assassination shone a spotlight on links between Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Unification Church, more popularly known as the \"Moonies\".Yamagami is reported to have told investigators he targeted Abe because he blamed the 67-year-old for allegedly promoting the church, which he said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.He alleged his mother made donations, said to total about 100 million yen ($660,000), as proof of her faith to the church.The allegations prompted investigations into the church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings, and led to four ministers resigning.Then, in March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the disbandment of the church, stripping it of its tax exempt status and requiring it to liquidate its assets. But Yamagami's mother - who is expected to be called as a witness - has reportedly not wavered in her beliefs, telling Japanese media that the killing has made her faith stronger, according to the Japan Times.Yamagami's trial is not expected to conclude until January, with the defendant denying charges relating to violation of arms control laws. His lawyer told the court the homemade weapon did not fall into the correct category, Japan's NHK said.Japan, which has very low levels of gun violence, has further strengthened its laws around homemade guns since Abe's killing.",

    "body": "1 day agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "30 minutes agoDavid Gritten,Jerusalem and Rushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in IstanbulWatch: Explosions seen in Gaza after Netanyahu orders strikesIsrael has carried out air strikes in Gaza, in response to what Israeli officials said were violations of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday, and breaching the terms on returning the bodies of deceased hostages.The Palestinian armed group claimed it had \"no connection\" to the attack and insisted it was committed to the ceasefire deal.At least 33 Palestinians were killed in the series of Israeli strikes, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency and hospital officials. The attacks hit homes, schools and residential blocks in Gaza City, Beit Lahia, al-Bureij, Nuseirat and Khan Younis.Anadolu via Getty ImagesFour people were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhoodDespite the flare-up, US Vice-President JD Vance said he believed the ceasefire was holding.A brief statement put out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Tuesday evening said he had ordered \"forceful strikes\" by the military but did not specify his reasons.However, Katz said Hamas had crossed \"a bright red line\" by launching an attack on Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday.\"Hamas will pay many times over for attacking the soldiers and for violating the agreement to return the fallen hostages,\" he warned.An Israeli military official said the Hamas attack took place \"east of the Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory inside Gaza under the ceasefire deal.Israeli media reported that troops in the southern Gaza city of Rafah had come under anti-tank missile and sniper fire on Tuesday afternoon, while Palestinian media reported Israeli artillery shelling in the area at the same time.After the Israeli military carried out air strikes in Gaza on Tuesday evening, witnesses reported powerful explosions in several parts of the territory, including Gaza City in the north and Khan Younis in the south.A spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency told the BBC that four people, including three women, were among those killed when a home belonging to the al-Banna family was bombed in the southern Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City.Strikes also reportedly hit a courtyard of al-Shifa hospital, in the western Rimal area.The Civil Defence spokesman said another five people were killed, including two children and a woman, when a vehicle was hit on al-Qassam Street in Khan Younis.Hamas issued a statement denying that its fighters had attacked Israeli troops and condemning the Israeli strikes.\"Hamas affirms that it has no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah and affirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement,\" it said.\"The criminal bombardment carried out by the fascist occupation [Israeli] army on areas of the Gaza Strip represents a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\"The group's military wing meanwhile said it would postpone the return of a hostage's body it had recovered on Tuesday due to what it called Israeli \"violations\".US Vice-President Vance told reporters in Washington: \"The ceasefire is holding. That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be little skirmishes here and there.\"\"We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an [Israeli] soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president's peace is going to hold despite that,\" he added.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians try to clear the rubble of destroyed buildings in Khan Younis, southern GazaEarlier, Israel's prime minister had pledged to take unspecified \"steps\" against Hamas after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains on Monday night that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased hostages still in Gaza.Netanyahu's office said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli hostage whose body was recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023, and that this constituted a \"clear violation\" of the ceasefire deal.The Israeli military also released footage from a drone that it said showed Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" in eastern Gaza City on Monday.\"Shortly afterwards,\" it added, the operatives \"summoned representatives of the Red Cross and staged a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".In a statement later the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) condemned what it called the \"fake recovery\", saying it had attended the scene \"at the request of Hamas\" and \"in good faith\".It went on: \"The ICRC team at this location were not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage – in general, our role as neutral intermediary does not include unearthing of the bodies of the deceased. \"Our team only observed what appeared to be the recovery of remains without prior knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it. \"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.\"ReutersThe ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey is supposed to implement the first stage of President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan.It said Hamas would return its 48 living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect on 10 October.All 20 living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing challenges because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\". He also said that \"some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them\".However, the Israeli government insists Hamas knows the locations of all the bodies.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,530 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "1 day agoCherylann Mollan, BBC News and Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC HindiBhopal, Madhya PradeshBBCAarish says he's worried about missing work after losing vision in his left eyeAarish, 15, sits on a hospital bed in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A pair of dark glasses hides a painful injury in his left eye.His cornea was damaged a week ago when an improvised firecracker device that he bought to celebrate the Diwali festival exploded near his face, causing him to lose vision in one eye. He has undergone emergency surgery and his doctor says only time will tell how much sight he can regain.The teenager, who doesn't go to school, says he's most worried about missing work - his father works as a gardener and Aarish repairs televisions to supplement the family income. Child labour is illegal in India, but millions of children work. Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

She is due in court again on Monday.In May, she was stopped at Tbilisi International Airport after 12kg (26lb) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lb) of hashish were found in her luggage. Miss Culley  previously claimed she was tortured to bring the drugs.Under the plea bargain agreement, her family paid 500,000 Georgian Lari (£137,000) to reduce her sentence.More than 90% of drug-related crimes in Georgia are resolved through plea bargains.ReutersLyanne Kennedy, speaking to reporters outside court, said her 19-year-old daughter was \"looking strong\"Speaking outside court, her mother said: \"We've confirmed that the funds have been sent but they need to confirm that they have been received and that is not going to happen until tomorrow.\"She is looking big, pregnant, but she is looking strong.\"Malkhaz Salakaia, representing Miss Culley, said the negotiations \"are nearing completion\".\"Plea bargain conditions are known to the family,\" he said.\"There is a technical issue to be resolved which will take a few days.\"Mr Salakaia previously said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.Rayhan Demytrie/BBCBella Culley is being detained at prison number 5Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May.It is understood she arrived on a flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates and police seized drugs from a travel bag.At a hearing in July, she pleaded not guilty to charges of possession and trafficking illegal drugs and claimed she had been \"forced to do this through torture\".\"I just wanted to travel,\" she said. \"I am a good person.

    "body": "30 minutes agoNikhil InamdarBBC News, MumbaiGetty ImagesThe Tata Group, headed by N Chandrasekaran, is facing severe business headwindsA year after the death of Ratan Tata, the Tata Group - a gigantic Indian salt-to-steel conglomerate which he steered into a global, modern, technologically advanced enterprise - finds itself facing a plethora of crises.The business empire, which owns iconic British brands such as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Tetley Tea and makes the iPhone for Apple in India, is, yet again, a divided house.For months, a boardroom power battle between trustees has exposed internal rifts that forced the government to step in and prevent a repeat of the very public legal tangle that engulfed the Tata empire in 2016, when its former chairman Cyrus Mistry was ousted from the group.While ministers in Delhi appeared to have brokered an uneasy truce weeks ago, latest reports suggest that Mehli Mistry, a close confidant of Ratan Tata and a trustee on the board of Tata Trusts, has been ousted from his position. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Prof Mircea Raianu of the University of Maryland who's written a seminal history of the corporation, views the tussle as a \"resurfacing of unresolved business\" - or the core question of who runs the show at Tata, and how much control majority shareholders (the philanthropic arm Tata Trusts which owns 66% of the parent company, Tata Sons) can wield in making business decisions.The Tata Group is uniquely structured, with controlling shares of the unlisted commercial holding company (Tata Sons) vested in a philanthropic organisation (Tata Trusts). While this has given the group tax and regulatory advantages, and allows it to carry out charitable activities, experts say it has also led to governance issues given its dual non-profit and commercial objectives.The latest rift comes at a time when the Tatas are facing severe business headwinds while trying to expand into new growth areas like semiconductors and electric vehicles, as well as attempting to revive Air India -  the ailing carrier they bought from the government in 2021 - following a tragic crash earlier this year. So, what's gone wrong?AFP via Getty ImagesA legal dispute engulfed the Tata empire in 2016, when its former chairman Cyrus Mistry (left) was ousted from the groupThe Tatas have not publicly commented on the discord, but it is widely reported to stem from differences among trustees over board nominations, funding approvals and the public listing of Tata Sons - the holding company of 26 publicly listed Tata firms with a market capitalisation of some $328bn.A source close to the Tata Group told the BBC on condition of anonymity that some of the trustees' desire for greater influence in making strategic decisions at Tata Sons and picking nominees on its board is at the centre of the tussle. Tata Trusts has three nominees on the Tata Sons board.\"The Tata Trusts nominees have a veto right in major company decisions, but it is understood that theirs is basically a supervisory role, not an assertive one,\" said the source. \"However now, some of the trustees want more power to make commercial decisions.\"Another more significant point of contention is the desire of the SP Group - the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, with an 18% stake - to take the company public. While the former has been pushing hard for it, most Tata trustees are against the idea.\"There is fear that going public would dilute the trust's decision-making capacity and long-term focus and expose Tata Sons to quarterly market pressures,\" said the source. \"This is especially because there are so many new businesses at a very nascent stage.\"But the SP Group has called its prospective public listing a \"moral and social imperative\" that would unlock value for Tata shareholders and improve transparency and governance at the company.Neither Tata Sons not Tata Trusts have responded to detailed questions from the BBC. But according to Prof Raianu, the tussle highlights a very real dilemma for the group.A public listing, he says, would be counter to what many giant conglomerates in the United States and Europe are increasingly doing - \"opting for foundation ownership to promote stability and sustainability\", ironically, by looking to the Tatas as an example.\"But at the same time, private or closely held companies are indeed subject to less outside scrutiny, which can fuel conflict and harm reputation,\" Prof Raianu adds.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesThe Air India crash in June occurred as the Tatas are trying to revive the ailing carrier The conflict has already raised governance concerns and hit the brand image of what is arguably one of India's oldest and most revered business houses, says publicist Dilip Cherian, who once worked closely with former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry. \"This just adds to the series of blows the Tata image has taken recently,\" Mr Cherian told the BBC, referring to the devastating Air India crash earlier this year and the cyber-attack on a key unit of JLR which plunged the UK's car production to a 70-year-low this September.Devastating crash threatens Air India's ambitious turnaroundFurther, TCS, the flagship software outsourcing company that contributes to nearly half the group's revenues, has been plagued with its own set of challenges, including mass layoffs and the recent ending of a $1bn contract by retailer Marks & Spencer. \"These boardroom battles create further confusion. There will not only be anxiety about share performance, but questions among investors about who exactly they are dealing with at the Tatas,\" said Mr Cherian.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesA cyber attack in September led to a five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factoriesAmid this turmoil, the tenure of N Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Tata Sons, has reportedly been extended.\"The chairman can continue doing his work, since this is not a rift within the board, but between the trustees. But it is an unnecessary distraction for him,\" the source close to Tata Sons said.But the Tatas are not new to firefighting crises. The group saw fierce battles in the 90s after Ratan Tata took over the group and attempted to modernise its operating structure. The conflict that broke out after Mistry's ouster a few years ago is still fresh in many people's memory.There is however, a major difference this time, says Prof Raianu.\"Underperforming companies at the time were held afloat by TCS, which facilitated continuity. Before TCS, this role was played by Tata Steel.\"Right now - with TCS's business model in a flux and its contribution to overall Tata group revenues coming under pressure - a similar \"anchor\" to the group is yet to emerge, making it harder for the group to fight such internal divisions.\"It is obviously destabilising and potentially destructive in the short term, but it is possible that a new and more transparent and accountable structure can emerge when the dust settles,\" says Prof Raianu.

    "body": "The Indian village which saw the  homecoming of one of the world's oldest rebels24 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentAPAfter more than 60 years, Thuingaleng Muivah returned to his native village in Manipur last weekLast week, a helicopter appeared over the green, folded hills of Ukhrul in India's north-eastern state of Manipur.By the time it touched down on a makeshift helipad outside Somdal village, the crowd had already begun to sing. When the door opened, the crowd surged towards a frail man in dark glasses and a black suit. Quickly, they draped him in a traditional shawl.After more than half a century, Thuingaleng Muivah, India's oldest rebel, had come home.  Now 91, Mr Muivah is the general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), or NSCN (I-M), the most powerful of the Naga insurgent factions that once fought the Indian state in one of Asia's longest-running rebellions - though today the organisation is often regarded as a shadow of its former self.His supporters see him as the keeper of a demand India has never recognised - a separate state for Naga people. His critics remember something else: a movement accused of targeted killings and running a parallel government in Nagaland through \"taxes\" many call extortion - allegations the NSCN (I-M) denies.Nagaland, a largely Christian state wedged between Myanmar and Bangladesh, is home to a people spread across neighbouring Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states. Muivah seeks either full sovereignty or a \"Greater Nagaland\" uniting Nagas across borders, especially in Manipur.Muivah himself was born in what is now Manipur state  - a reminder that the Naga identity extends far beyond Nagaland's borders.This was his second attempt to return home - the first, in 2010, was blocked by the Manipur government, which cited the risk of unrest and security concerns. When he finally made it back with his wife last week, almost the entire village gathered to welcome the Avakharar - the \"eldest father\", as they called him. Among them was his only surviving sibling, 84-year-old Asui Muivah.\"Generation comes and goes, but the nation stays,\" he wrote in a message read aloud by his deputy, VS Atem, as he was too weak to speak himself. \"The issue we are fighting for is greater and older than most of us.\"APHundreds had gathered to welcome Muivah, the general secretary of the most powerful Naga insurgent faction called NSCN (I-M)Muivah had left this same hillside village in 1964, trekking east to join the Naga struggle for sovereignty - a journey that would take him to the jungles of northern Myanmar, the ideological camps of Maoist China and the negotiation tables of Delhi. After coming out of the jungles for a ceasefire in 1997, Muivah has lived in Delhi and a sprawling camp in Hebron in Nagaland, which serves as the NSCN (I-M)'s headquarters, complete with signs declaring, \"Freedom is the birthright of all nations\". \"His return to his village is more personal than political - driven by a longing for home. His calls for a separate Naga flag and a constitution are expected, and they help keep him politically relevant. But the broader idea of 'Greater Nagaland' has largely faded over the years,\" says Pradip Phanjoubam, editor-in-chief of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics.The Naga struggle predates India itself. In 1918, returning World War One labourers formed the Naga Club to assert a distinct identity. When India became independent in 1947, Naga leaders refused to join the new republic, declaring, \"We are not Indians\", and held their own unrecognised plebiscite for independence in 1951.As armed conflict began to intensify, the Indian government sent in troops in 1955. What followed was decades of insurgency, factional splits and ceasefires. The rebellion claimed thousands of lives, displaced generations and militarised the lush, Christian-majority hills. \"The Naga conflict,\" says political scientist Sanjib Baruah, \"is among the world's least-known but longest-running armed movements.\"Muivah was born in March 1935 in Somdal, where his family often went hungry. Educated at a local Christian school, he was drawn early to the ideas of revolution and Naga nationalism. By his teens, Muivah was already a Naga nationalist, singing \"God Bless My Nagaland\" at school and questioning why his people lived in \"humiliation\" under the colonial government. After studying at St Anthony's College in Shillong and reading Marx, Hegel and Rousseau, he joined the Naga National Council (NNC) - the first political organisation of the Nagas to demand independence from India - in 1964.APPeople waved the Naga flag - the symbol of an unfulfilled political dream - as they waited for Muivah's arrival last weekTwo years later, 31-year-old Muivah joined more than 130 guerrillas on a 97-day trek through the jungles of northern Myanmar to China's Yunnan province. \"We carried our own rice and slept on grass in clearings,\" he said in a 1998 interview. \"I could stand the hunger, but sometimes there was no water to drink.\" They crossed rivers on bamboo rafts hacked through thick undergrowth, and trudged on in subzero cold. Beijing trained the rebels in guerrilla warfare, Marxist-Leninist theory and \"people's war\". Muivah studied briefly in Beijing's College of Diplomacy, visited Vietnam and came back speaking reverently of Mao and Zhou Enlai - though he would later fuse their ideology with a deeply Christian nationalism. He returned to Nagaland after five years.In 1980, Muivah and his comrades Isak Chishi Swu and SS Khaplang founded the NSCN, breaking away from the older NNC that had signed a controversial peace accord with Delhi. Their faction later split again - into the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K), led by Khaplang of Myanmar - spawning smaller offshoots across the northeast. At its height, the NSCN (I-M) was the mother of all insurgencies in the region, training and arming smaller ethnic groups and running what India's intelligence agencies called a \"shadow state\" across the hills, according to Subir Bhaumik, a veteran chronicler of the region. The group faced accusations of extortion, killings and human rights abuses.Critics within the Naga insurgency also point to a violent legacy. The Zeliangrong United Front (ZUF) has accused Muivah of ordering \"merciless killings of many prominent leaders\" and carrying out arson in villages \"in the name of taxation or fighting the Indian Army,\" leaving \"common Nagas\" to bear the cost, its spokesperson Louis Gangmei said.Over the years, Muivah transformed from jungle commissar to political negotiator. After decades of exile - in Thailand, the Netherlands and the borderlands of Myanmar -  he entered a ceasefire with India.But his demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution remains a stumbling block. In a interview in 2020, Muivah told journalist Karan Thapar: \"The Nagas will never be part of the Indian Union, nor accept its constitution. There can be no solution without our flag and our constitution.\"The Indian government has offered greater autonomy, but rejects any concession implying sovereignty; the 2015 Framework Agreement, once hailed as a breakthrough, now languishes. \"We have not surrendered our free existence and sovereignty ,\" Muivah declared last week. \"Come what may, we shall defend it to the last.\" APArmed cadres of Muivah's group kept guard as they waited for his arrivalYet over the past decade, as Muivah's health declined and the movement splintered into dozens of factions, the NSCN (I-M)'s once-formidable influence has waned. A younger generation of Nagas, weary of blockades and extortion, now increasingly seeks peace and economic stability. At the same time, experts like Prof Baruah say that the \"proud display of Naga flags in his home village testifies to the vitality and resilience of the Naga movement\"  - a reminder that while its horizons may have narrowed, the sentiment endures.More importantly, he adds, \"even objectively strong states can choose live-and-let-live deals with armed groups rather than trying to disarm and demobilise them\".Muivah says his group has held more than 600 rounds of talks with New Delhi on a Naga homeland since the late 1990s. Yet critics remain unsparing. The Manipur-based ZUF dismissed his return as \"empty-handed,\" arguing there is \"no reason to glorify an individual who failed the Nagas on all fronts.\" Supporters believe he is war-weary, unsure of peace, and still waiting for the political settlement that has defined his life's struggle.As early as 2006, he told Mr Bhaumik, the journalist, \"I am very tired. I feel doubly tired because there seems to be no result coming out of the talks.\" The wait goes on.Additional reporting by Abhishek Dey",

    "body": "The 92-year-old president who never loses22 hours agoPaul MellyAfrica analystReutersTo absolutely no-one's surprise, Cameroon's Constitutional Council has proclaimed the re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, the world's oldest head of state, for an eighth successive term.Amid rumours of a close result and claims of victory by his main challenger, former government minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary, excitement and tension had been building in the run-up to Monday's declaration. Hopes for a shock result were briefly raised.Consequently, despite it being part of the long-term pattern, the official outcome, victory for Biya with 53.7%, ahead of Tchiroma Bakary on 35.2%, came as a disappointment and an anti-climax for many Cameroonians.Biya's decision to stand for another seven-year mandate, after 43 years in power, was inevitably contentious. Not only because of his longevity in power, but also because his style of governance has raised questions.Extended stays abroad, habitually at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva or alternative more discreet locations around the Swiss lakeside city, have repeatedly triggered speculation about the extent to which he is actually governing Cameroon - or whether most decisions are in fact taken by the prime minister and ministers or the influential secretary general of the presidency, Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh.Last year, after making a speech at a Second World War commemoration in the South of France in August and attending the China Africa summit in Beijing the next month, the president disappeared from view for almost six weeks without any announcement or explanation, sparking speculation about his health.Even after senior officials appeared to indicate that he was, once again, in Geneva, reportedly working as usual, there was no real news until the announcement of his impending return home to the capital, Yaoundé, where he was filmed being greeted by supporters.And this year it was not really a surprise when he squeezed a further pre-election visit to Geneva into his schedule just weeks before polling day.Biya's inscrutable style of national leadership, rarely calling formal meetings of the full cabinet or publicly addressing complex issues, leaves a cloud of uncertainty over the goals of his administration and the formation of government policy.At a technical level, capable ministers and officials pursue a wide range of initiatives and programmes. But the political vision and sense of direction has been largely absent.ReutersOpposition supporters say that Biya's victory was riggedHis regime has shown itself sporadically willing to crack down on protest or detain more vocal critics. But that is not the only or perhaps even the most important factor that has kept him in power.For it has to be said that Biya has also fulfilled a distinctive political role.He has acted as a balancing figure in what is a complex country, marked by large social, regional and linguistic differences - between, for example, the equatorial south and the savannah north, or the majority of regions that are French-speaking and the English-speaking North-West and South-West, with their different educational and institutional traditions.In a state whose early post-independence years were marked by debates over federalism and tensions over the form that national unity should take, he has assembled governments that include representatives of a wide range of backgrounds.Albeit sometimes under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international creditors, his administrations have averted debt disaster and, in recent years, gradually consolidated national finances.Moreover, the past decade or so has seen Biya appear increasingly almost like a constitutional monarch, a symbolic figure who may decide a few key issues but leaves others to set the course on most policy areas.And his continuation in this role has been facilitated by the competitive rivalries between senior figures in the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). While he is there, the succession does not have to be decided.However, with no designated or preferred political heir apparent, and with some one-time \"next generation\" CPDM figures themselves now getting on in years, Biya's perpetuation in office has fuelled a constantly turning rumour mill about the succession.Increasingly, the name of his son Franck has been cited, even though he shows little interest in politics or government.Meanwhile, there is no shortage of either development or security challenges for the president despite Cameroon's rich natural resource diversity.Is it possible that today we are seeing a decisive erosion in popular tolerance of Biya's self-effacing version of semi-authoritarian rule?Are Cameroonians tiring of a system that offers them multi-party electoral expression but little hope of actually changing their rulers?Has the bloody crisis in the English-speaking regions exposed the limits of the president's cautious and distant approach?When protests demanding reform first erupted there in 2016 Biya was slow to respond. By the time he did offer meaningful change and a national dialogue, the momentum of violence had accelerated, eroding the space for real compromise.Meanwhile, so low-key in style, he has failed to really sell an economic and social development vision for Cameroon or instil a sense of progress towards a goal.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Biya faced a strong challenge from his former ally, Issa Tchiroma BakaryBiya was already testing the limits of popular tolerance with his decision to stand for a seventh successive term in 2018.But ultimately he managed to face down a strong opposition challenge from Maurice Kamto, leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) - and when Kamto disputed the official results awarding him only 14% of the vote, he was detained for more than eight months.But this time around, Tchiroma's candidacy shifted the mood and sense of possibility in a way that no previous challenger has managed, at least since 1992, when even official results credited John Fru Ndi, of the Social Democratic front (SDF), with 36% of the vote, only just behind Biya on 40%.And this time it is not just that Biya is seven years older and even more hands-off than before.It is also that, in contrast to Kamto - who struggled to reach far beyond his core electorate - Tchiroma, a Muslim northerner, has attracted support from a wide cross section of society and of Cameroon's regions, notably including the two anglophone regions.This one-time political prisoner who later compromised with Biya and accepted a ministerial post, had the guts to go to Bamenda, the largest English-speaking city, and apologise for his role in the government's actions.And over recent days, as tensions grew in the run-up to the result declaration, Tchiroma shrewdly stayed in Garoua, his home city in the north, where crowds of young supporters had gathered to shield him from the risk of arrest by the security forces.Now, after expectations that had built so high, there is intense frustration and anger among opposition supporters at the official result, however expected it may have been.The security forces were already reported to have shot protesters in Douala, the southern port city that is the hub of the economy. And shooting has now been reported from Garoua too.For Cameroon, Biya's determination to secure an eighth presidential term has brought high risks and painful costs.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.You may also be interested in:From government spin doctor to Cameroon president's main rivalSocial media revamp by 92-year-old presidentAre Africa's leaders too old to govern the young?Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

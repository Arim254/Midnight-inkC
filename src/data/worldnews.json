    "body": "Staff at a Virginia liquor store got a shock on Saturday when they came into work to find a raccoon had burgled the store, drinking its way through the spirits section.The \"masked bandit\" was found passed out in the bathroom between the toilet and bin having helped itself to bottles on a bottom shelf.Animal control officer Samantha Martin transported the \"suspect\" for questioning at Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter but not before it had a chance to sober up.After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover), the animal was safely released back into the wild.The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered its \"Black Friday break-in\".When staff arrived on Saturday they found smashed bottles and liquor pooling on the floor, including its apparent tipple of choice, scotch. Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

Witnesses said the initial strike had targeted a tent inside the al-Mawasi displacement area, followed by blasts near the Kuwait hospital, prompting panic among families sheltering nearby.Hamas called Israel's action barbaric, indiscriminate and a violation of the ceasefire which began on 10 October.The Israeli military launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 70,100 Palestinians have since been killed as a result of Israel's campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has lost his appeal against a guilty verdict of lying to a parliamentary committee.In February, Singh was fined S$14,000 ($10,800; £8,100) for two charges related to his handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party who confessed to lying to parliament.In a short hearing to a packed court public gallery on Friday, the judge said Singh's conviction was supported by the evidence provided.Singh, who leads the main opposition Workers' Party, said that he was \"disappointed\" with the decision but accepted it \"fully and without reservation\". He paid his fines at the courthouse after the hearing on Friday. \"Might as well get it done,\" he told reporters.Singh retains his seat in parliament despite the conviction, and said on Friday that he would keep serving Singaporeans along with his colleagues.The Workers' Party is the the only opposition party in Singapore's current parliament, where it holds 12 out of 99 seats.The saga began in 2021, when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim.She later admitted that her anecdote was not true, but said during a parliamentary committee investigation that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to \"continue with the narrative\" despite knowing about the lie.Khan has since resigned from the party and parliament. She was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege.In February, the court ruled that Singh's actions were \"strongly indicative\" that he had not wanted Khan to clarify her lie.But Singh, who maintained his innocence throughout the trial, argued that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue.During Singh's appeal hearing in November, his lawyer argued that the court had \"ignored crucial pieces of evidence\" in its ruling.Singh's lawyer also sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Khan and her aides, who served as witnesses.When the judge asked why Singh seemed to be \"doing nothing\" to get Khan to own up in the weeks after learning about her lie in parliament, Singh's lawyer said that he had other urgent professional and personal matters to deal with.However, the prosecution argued that Singh's inaction, along with other pieces of evidence, proved that he had never intended for Khan to come clean.Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker.Critics have previously accused Singapore's government of using the judiciary to go after its political opponents - charges the authorities have always denied.",

    "body": "17 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterAdidas has fended off an appeal from shareholders who accused it of hiding misconduct by rapper-entrepreneur Kanye West - otherwise known as Ye - before their partnership broke down in 2022.A San Francisco court said the sportswear giant did not mislead investors, who claimed they had lost money after Adidas shares plunged when it cut ties with West.The Yeezy tie-up with West had been one of Adidas' most successful partnerships, but its collapse after a spate of anti-Semitic comments by the rapper cost the brand hundreds of millions of dollars.The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment but could not reach the firm leading the class action or West's team.West, who is not party to the lawsuit, was widely criticised after repeatedly making antisemitic remarks and promoting conspiracy theories.His Yeezy brand collaboration with Adidas was put under review after he showed a \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt design at a fashion show in 2022. Shortly after, he posted anti-Semitic comments online, which prompted Adidas to pull his products from sale.West's behaviour also prompted several companies, including Gap and JP Morgan, to sever ties with the rapper.Court documents filed on Wednesday show that HLSA-ILA Funds, the firm representing investors, alleged that Adidas continued its partnership with West despite knowing about his controversial conduct for years.The filing claims Adidas \"internally grappled\" with West's behaviour but misled shareholders by failing to disclose the risk in its reports.The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ultimately sided with Adidas. The court said on Wednesday that a reasonable investor would know that a partnership with a celebrity like West could come with \"inherent risks relating to improper behaviour\".A district court had previously dismissed HLSA-ILA's case, and the firm later appealed.The collapse of Adidas' partnership with West caused the German firm's share price to tank in 2023.Yeezy, luxury trainers designed by West, had been a particularly lucrative line of products for Adidas, generating around €1.5bn (£870m; $1.17bn) in sales in 2021.The partnership breakdown left Adidas with more than €1bn worth of Yeezy shoes sitting in storage. In 2023, the brand announced that it would sell those products and donate some of the proceeds to charities who worked on combating hate.",

    "body": "The Israeli military has carried out a new round of air strikes in southern Lebanon, less than a day after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades.Residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group. No casualties have been reported.An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a ceasefire violation and warned that it would continue to operate \"to remove any threat\" to Israel. Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect in November 2024, following 13 months of conflict.There was no immediate comment from Lebanon's leaders to Thursday's strikes. Lebanese politicians have previously condemned similar strikes as ceasefire violations.Under the first phase of a deal brokered by the US and France, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to remove its fighters and weapons from south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel - a plan the group and its allies oppose.Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and stepped up its air strikes in recent weeks. It is an escalation officials say is driven by Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild its military infrastructure and what they see as limited Lebanese government efforts to disarm the group.Thursday's strikes came less than 24 hours after Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to the Lebanese border town of Naqoura for their first direct talks in decades.The talks, hosted at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, Unifil, took place during a meeting of the ceasefire monitoring committee, which until now had only included military officers from the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and Unifil.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying the meeting \"took place in a good atmosphere\" and that it \"was agreed that ideas would be formulated to advance possible economic cooperation between Israel and Lebanon\".It also said that Israeli envoys \"clarified that the disarmament of Hezbollah is obligatory, regardless of the advancement of economic co-operation\".Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam was more cautious, saying Lebanon remained \"far\" from diplomatic normalisation with Israel and that the talks were focused on \"defusing tension\".\"We are not yet at peace talks,\" he told reporters, saying Lebanon's priorities were the cessation of hostilities, the release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel, and Israel's full withdrawal from its territory.He added that Beirut was open to the deployment of French and US troops to help verify efforts to disarm Hezbollah.The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire.",

    "body": "The EU's former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has been accused of fraud as part of an EU investigation into the misuse of funds, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) has said.The EPPO said searches were carried out on Tuesday at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, headed by Ms Mogherini, as well as the European External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels - the office she ran for five years as the bloc's top diplomat.The investigation relates to EU-funded training for junior diplomats, the EPPO said. As well as Ms Mogherini, a senior College of Europe staff member and a senior official from the European Commission were detained, the prosecutor's office added.According to the EPPO, the three were formally told of the allegations against them: \"the accusations concern procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy.\"The three accused were all subsequently released as they were not considered a flight risk and their homes were also searched.After a reported 10 hours of questioning, Ms Mogherini issued a statement saying she had \"clarified my position with the investigators\", adding that, \"in its long tradition, the College has always applied and will continue to apply the highest standards of integrity and fairness\".\"I have full confidence in the justice system, and I trust that the correctness of the College's actions will be ascertained. I will obviously continue to offer my full collaboration to the authorities,\" she said.Under Belgian law, a person can be arrested then released without being charged, while remaining a suspect.The EPPO said the investigation focused on a tender that the EEAS awarded to the College of Europe in 2021-2022. It added that there were \"strong suspicions\" of favouritism related to the tender for  a nine-month training course for junior diplomats.The EPPO, which investigates alleged crimes against the financial interests of the EU, did not name the three people questioned but said the immunity of several suspects had been lifted as part of the investigation.The College of Europe is an independent school attended by aspiring EU civil servants. It is closely associated with and partly funded by the EU. ",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has said either Ukrainian troops will withdraw from the country's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it - rejecting any compromise over a major obstacle to ending the Ukraine war.\"Either we take back these territories by force, or eventually Ukrainian troops withdraw,\" Putin told India Today.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory, whether held by Russia or not.Putin's comments come after President Donald Trump said his negotiators believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after talks in Moscow on Tuesday. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who led the US side of the talks, is due to meet Ukraine's negotiators in Florida.Trump said the talks were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango.\"Russian forces now control some 85% of the Donbas. The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin also said that Moscow disagrees with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin said Moscow had not seen a modified version of the US peace plan before his nearly five-hour talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" Putin said.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said the Kremlin talks produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia accused Putin of \"wasting the world's time\", while Ukraine's ambassador to the US said they do not \"need to wait for promises from Russia\".Zelensky has insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, he said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\", but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.Zelensky earlier said his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during last week's talks with an American delegation in Geneva.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "Suspect arrested in pipe bomb incident on eve of Jan 6, ending years-long manhuntAuthorities arrested a Virginia man in connection to two pipe bombs placed outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees on the eve of the 6 January Capitol riot nearly five years ago.US Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI officials said Brian Cole Jr, 30, was arrested without incident early Thursday morning. He is charged with use of an explosive device and could face other charges as the investigation continues. The arrest caps a years-long hunt for the assailant who planted the bombs, which involved an extensive investigation and a $500,000 (£375,000) reward. The pipe bombs were safely deactivated and did not explode.The FBI did not receive new information or a tip that cracked the case, officials said. Investigators sifted through existing evidence gathered over the years - including some three million lines of data - to identify the alleged suspect.US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said the Trump administration had made solving the case a priority.\"It was like finding a needle in a haystack,\" she said.Earlier this year, the FBI released CCTV footage of an individual with a backpack and light grey hooded sweater placing something near a bench outside the Democratic National Committee building in Washington. The person was shown later walking to place the second bomb.Both were placed the night before the 6 January riot, and were only discovered as rioters began to storm the US Capitol. At the time, US senators were meeting there to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Joe Biden had won, defeating Donald Trump. Trump, who was president at the time, addressed a large crowd of supporters at a rally near the White House, where he urged them to march \"peacefully\" to the US Capitol, but also made unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud.The crowd numbered between 2,000 and 2,500 people, and included members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Many were carrying weapons.Hundreds then forced their way into the building through windows and doors, overwhelming police. It took law enforcement almost four hours to restore order.As the riot began, a passerby discovered the two pipe bombs, police said at the time. The items allegedly left behind included pipes, wires, kitchen timers, and homemade black powder, according to the FBI.According to a CBS report, the bombs had one method of detonation: a 60-minute kitchen timer. But they ultimately did not explode for unknown reasons. Police had been searching for a suspect ever since.Many of those convicted or charged in relation to the riot have since been pardoned by Trump earlier this year, shortly after he took office for his second term in January. Pardons or commutations were issued for more than 1,500 people. Trump also ordered the US Department of Justice to drop all pending cases against other suspects. At the time, Trump referred to the accused and convicted as \"the hostages\", and said that their lives had been \"destroyed\".\"What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in the history of our country,\" he had said.",

    "body": "Israel has announced it will open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the coming days to allow Palestinians to leave the territory.Israeli military body Cogat said exits would be \"facilitated through co-ordination with Egypt, following security approval by Israel and under the supervision of the European Union mission\". It added that this would be \"similar to the mechanism that operated in January\", when the crossing opened during a previous ceasefire.An Israeli security official said it was an expression of Israel's support for the current ceasefire with Hamas, which began seven weeks ago.However, Egypt denied it was co-ordinating with Israel to reopen the Rafah crossing.The State Information Service cited an official Egyptian source as saying that \"if an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the plan of US President Donald Trump\".Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan states that \"opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism\" implemented under the January ceasefire deal.The crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. Before then, it was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. At least 16,500 severely ill or injured Palestinians in need of lifesaving medical treatment abroad are currently waiting to be evacuated from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. It says only 235 patients, almost all of them children, have been evacuated via crossings with Israel since the ceasefire took effect.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Palestinian Authority (PA) forces would assist in operating the reopened Rafah crossing alongside the EU's Border Assistance Mission.It cited a European source as saying Palestinian representatives had also helped during the previous ceasefire but without wearing PA insignia due to \"Israeli sensitivity\" over their presence in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role in the future governance of the territory for the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.Haaretz also reported that Netanyahu had so far blocked the reopening of the Rafah crossing because of the delayed return of the bodies of deceased hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli – Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is a Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday morning that forensic testing had shown that human remains handed over by Hamas in Gaza the previous day did not belong to either of the two men.On Wednesday afternoon, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said it had recovered the body of a hostage in northern Gaza. The body will be transferred later to Israeli forces via the Red Cross, according to Hamas's military wing.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "1 day agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

His body was then taken to Gaza and held hostage by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.His mother, On, told Israeli Army Radio that it was \"hard for us to digest the news\" after being informed that his body had been recovered by PIJ fighters in northern Gaza.\"Two years have passed,\" she said. \"We felt great sadness when we knew he was no longer among the living.\"Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote on X: \"For 789 painful days, Suthisak was held hostage in Gaza. His family back in Thailand have waited in agony for his return. Now, Suthisak can finally be laid to rest with dignity.\"\"Hamas's cruelty continues. Ran Gvili, a police officer who fought and fell heroically on October 7th, is still being held hostage in Gaza. When we say we won't stop until every last hostage is home, we mean it.\"A spokesperson for Thailand's foreign ministry thanked the Israeli government for the assistance that led to the return of all 31 Thai nationals who were among the 251 people taken hostage during the 7 October attack. Another 39 Thai nationals were among the 1,200 people killed that day.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.ReutersPalestinian Islamic Jihad said it had found the body of a hostage in northern GazaUnder the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of four foreign hostages - two of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.The seven-week-old ceasefire has continued to look shaky, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of repeated violations.On Wednesday night, an Israeli air strike killed five Palestinians, including two children, at a camp for displaced families in the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, a hospital said.Israel's military said it targeted a \"Hamas terrorist\" in retaliation for an earlier attack by Hamas fighters in the Rafah area that wounded five Israeli soldiers.Hamas said the Israeli strike constituted a \"clear war crime\".Speaking to journalists at the White House, US President Donald Trump said the next stage of his Gaza peace plan - which includes plans for the post-war governance, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction - was \"going to happen pretty soon\".\"They had a problem today, I understand, with a bomb that went off,\" Trump said. \"Hurt some people pretty badly… But it's going very well. We have peace in the Middle East. People don't realise it.\"",

    "body": "South Korean authorities are developing a mobile app for stalking victims to track in real-time the location of their stalkers, if they're nearby.The app, announced by South Korea's justice ministry on Wednesday, is part of an approved amendment to the country's electronic monitoring law.Stalkers have become a subject of public concern in South Korea, especially as high-profile crimes involving stalking have made headlines in recent years.Under the current law, stalking victims can receive text message alerts when their stalkers are nearby - though these do not reveal stalkers' exact locations.This makes it difficult for victims to determine the direction of the perpetrator, the justice ministry said in a statement.Under the revised law, victims will be allowed to see their stalker's location on a map with their smartphones, allowing them to evacuate to safety.Authorities track stalkers' whereabouts using wearable electronic devices.The justice ministry said it was also working on integrating the tracking system into the national emergency hotline, so police could be deployed to protect victims as needed.This integration is expected to be completed next year, local media reported.Critics have voiced concern over the pervasiveness of stalking in South Korea, which they see as part of a wider problem of violence against women - many of whom have been secretly filmed by spy cameras and faced hostile threats for being feminists.In 2022, public anger erupted over the murder of a young woman by her male ex-colleague, who had been stalking her for years. Although she had reported him to the police, he was not detained or given a restraining order as authorities viewed him as \"low risk\".In 2021, South Korea introduced an anti-stalking law that carries up to three years of jail for offenders and a maximum fine of 30 million Korean won ($20,400; £15,300).In 2023, South Korea's parliament revised the law to lower the barrier to prosecuting stalkers.The number of reports against stalkers have surged since then, from 7,600 in 2022 to more than 13,000 last year, according to data from the justice ministry.",

The vehicle was a similar size to the pool and the teenagers - aged 14, 15 and 19 - were unable to open the doors and drowned.The freak accident occurred in the town of Alès in the early hours of Wednesday. \"It's truly the height of horror,\" said public prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini. \"It wasn't the impact of the accident that killed them. They found themselves upside down in icy water, unable to get out. They had no chance.\" Unconfirmed reports suggest the youngest of the three victims was at the wheel of the car at the time.The accident, which happened during a night of heavy rain, was the result of an \"unbelievable series of circumstances,\" the prosecutor told AFP news agency.The prosecutor described how the car had smashed through a low-level garden wall, flipped over and landed \"with all four wheels in the air\".It was not for several hours that the alarm was raised and firefighters were called to drain the pool and remove the vehicle. BFMTV reported that the pool was about 1.5m (5ft) deep.A mangled car was pulled on to a firefighters' truck during the morning and video from the scene showed the private swimming pool next to the collapsed wall. Canisters of nitrous oxide were found in the car, according to French reports. The substance is used by recreational users as it can make people feel relaxed, light-headed or dizzy.An investigation has been opened into the cause of death. The three victims' bodies  have been taken to the forensic institute in Nîmes for post mortem examinations, AFP said.",

    "body": "Authorities in Hong Kong have ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh from buildings undergoing renovations by Saturday, as investigations continue into the Chinese territory's deadliest blaze in decades.It is now known that 159 people died as a result of the fire last Wednesday at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - with 31 still missing.Investigators have found that a protective netting used around the complex, which had been undergoing extensive renovations, failed to meet flame retardant standards.Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho said new guidelines for testing materials used in scaffolding would be issued next week.Around 200 private residential and 10 public buildings are currently undergoing renovations in Hong Kong. The South China Morning Post, which is based in the territory, says about 300 buildings will be affected by the removal order.\"I assure the public that we will chase to the end the accountability of any contractors using substandard scaffolding mesh,\" Linn was quoted as saying.Samples had already been taken from mesh for testing, she added.At Wang Fuk Court, flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials said.Police have made at least 15 arrests for manslaughter as the investigation into the cause of the fire proceeds. On Wednesday, they said they had completed their searches of the interiors of all seven of the complex's towers and would now look for bodies in other parts of the buildings such as the remnants of the bamboo scaffolding.\"We have not finished our work,\" Police Commissioner Joe Chow said.\"As you can see... a lot of bamboo has fallen down. We still need to do some work... to see if any bodies were covered by the bamboo.\"He added that 140 of the 159 bodies found to date had been identified and were those of 49 males and 91 females, aged between one and 97, Radio Television Hong Kong reports.A married couple in their 70s, who lost their home in the blaze, returned to the charred site with their daughter on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports.\"It all happened within just an hour or two,\" said the mother, whose name was given only as Leung.She continued: \"I stood there watching as one block after another went up in flames, my legs felt so weak I could hardly stand. When I saw it, I felt completely helpless. I still don't understand how the fire could spread so fiercely, devouring one building after another. It was terrifying. \"The bamboo scaffolding cracked and there was banging that sounded like exploding windows, the flames were completely out of control.\"Her daughter, Bonnie, added: \"We also hope the truth will come out - whether there were hidden hands behind this, corruption or any improper dealings.\"   ",

Thank God. Continue mission!\"BBC Verify tracked the plane, and found that it began losing altitude off the south-west coast of Ireland. It then headed back east, having dropped to an altitude of 10,000 feet, accoring to FlightRadar24.At this time, the plane started broadcasting a \"7700 squawk code\" on its transponder. These are relayed to signify a general emergency onboard, ranging from engine failure to depressurisation to a medical emergency.It subsequently landed at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk shortly after 19:00 BST (18:00 GMT), according to publicly available flight tracking data.In February a government plane carrying Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to turn back due to a crack in the window of the cockpit, as well.Defence ministers had gathered in Belgium on Wednesday to discuss security in Ukraine.

    "body": "OceanGate's Titan submersible imploded on its journey to the wreck of the Titantic because of poor engineering and multiple failures to test the vessel, according to an official report.Titan imploded in June 2023, killing all five passengers on board including OceanGate's chief executive.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the engineering process behind the vehicle was \"inadequate\", resulting in faults which meant it failed to meet strength and durability requirements.The NTSB said because the firm did not adequately test Titan it did not know its actual strength. It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage.Titan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.In August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was \"preventable\" and criticised OceanGate's \"critically flawed\" safety practices.Stockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive, operated the Titan on its final journey.The passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding.During its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate.While some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment \"where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored\".One technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as \"mission specialists\" as opposed to passengers.Under US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible.The technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: \"… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation.\" In a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: \"If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoel Guinto andYuna KuBBC Korean, in SeoulSouth Korea's Supreme Court has struck down a lower court's order for billionaire Chey Tae-won to pay his ex-wife a 1.38tn won ($1bn; £788m) settlement, in a case dubbed by local media as the \"divorce of the century\".Citing a miscalculation that increased the value of the couple's assets, it has ordered the case to be reviewed. The case has gripped South Korea as Mr Chey heads the powerful SK Group conglomerate while his ex-wife Roh So-young is the daughter of a former president.The marriage unravelled in 2015 after Mr Chey admitted to fathering a child with his lover.The 1.38 trillion won payout was decided by a court in the capital Seoul in 2024. It was considered the largest divorce settlement in South Korea's history at the time. The court said a 30bn won slush fund by Ms Roh's father, former president Roh Tae-woo, had helped contribute to the growth of SK Group and could be considered as her contribution to the couple's joint assets.Mr Chey then appealed the settlement.On Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that the slush fund \"appeared to have originated from bribes illegally received\" by the former president and thus could not be considered part of the couple's assets.\"I think it is very significant that the Supreme Court clearly declared that it was wrong to recognise that as a contribution to the couple's joint property,\" said Mr Chey's lawyer, Lee Jae-geun.However, the Supreme Court upheld a 2bn won alimony payment for Ms Roh.Shares of SK fell 5.4% after the ruling on Thursday, as it was seen to prolong Mr Chey's legal battle with his ex-wife.But in the short term analysts believe a shake-up at SK Group is unlikely, as Mr Chey is not immediately compelled to raise funds for his divorce settlement.He controls key subsidiaries of the group such as SK Telecom, SK Square and SK Innovation.SK's businesses span the telecommunications, energy, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor sectors.",

    "body": "Four Chinese officials have been dismissed over a fireworks display in the Himalayas last month by outdoor apparel brand Arc'teryx that drew heated criticism. Videos of brightly coloured fireworks that apparently resembled a \"rising dragon\" erupting over a lush Tibetan landscape had sparked environmental concerns and a boycott campaign.  Arc'teryx and the Chinese pyrotechnics artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who designed the show, later apologised.Authorities in Tibet's Shigatse city said in a statement on Wednesday that more officials had been investigated and given warnings. They added that Arc'teryx and Cai have to provide compensation and help \"restore the environment\". Authorities said the fireworks, which lasted for nearly a minute and affected around 30 hectares (74 acres) of grassland, have caused limited short-term damage but said further monitoring was needed to assess \"ecological risks\".\"The incident created fireworks remnants, plastic debris and other things that were not thoroughly cleaned,\" the statement added.\"The instantaneous bright light and loud noise produced by the fireworks caused short-term disturbance to wild animals.\"The four officials who have been sacked include Gyantse county's Communist Party secretary, public security chief and two senior members of county and city-level environmental agencies.The artist who orchestrated the display, Cai, is best-known for his role behind fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He has said he would work with authorities in Tibet to help with the area's recovery.Social media users, who said the stunt ran counter to Arc'teryx's conservation-focused image, had called for a boycott of the brand.Arc'teryx was founded in 1989 and has more than 150 shops worldwide. It is now owned by a Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports.The firm claimed the display had been aimed to promote local mountain culture, but said in its apology that it was \"out of line with Arc'teryx's values\". It also said it had used biodegradable materials and would work with an external agency to assess the project's impact.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAbhishek DeyBBC News, GuwahatiIndia's goods exports to the US, its largest foreign market, dropped sharply by 20% in September and nearly 40% in the last four months, as Trump's steep tariffs took effect, data shows. September was the first full month of Washington's 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which kicked in on 27 August. This includes a 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia. \"US has become India's most severely affected market since the tariff escalation began,\" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.Negotiations for a trade deal between the two countries are under way, with the goal of concluding an agreement by next month.According to GTRI, the most significant impact of the tariffs has been felt by labour-heavy sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and chemicals, which have suffered the heaviest losses. Shipments to the US have seen four consecutive months of decline, and are down 37.5% - from $8.8bn (£6.5bn) in May to $5.5bn in September. The drop in exports have also contributed to India's trade deficit (the gap between what a country imports and exports), which widened to a 13-month high of $32.15 billion in September. Some of the reduction in exports to the US was cushioned by improved trade with countries like the UAE and China. Trade negotiations between India and the US resumed last month after months of stalling over a number of differences. An Indian delegation is currently in the US for  talks.On Wednesday, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine. A spokesperson of the Indian foreign ministry said discussions were \"ongoing\" with the US administration which had \"shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India\".But major sticking points over trade still remain, including access to agriculture and dairy. For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and the interests of millions of small farmers.Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "Indian cinema tickets are getting pricier - but not everyone's complaining8 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiGetty ImagesIndia has seen a steady rise in average movie ticket prices over the past few yearsSahil Arora, 20, had been eagerly waiting to watch the latest Bollywood release starring his favourite actor.But going to the theatre set him back considerably - a seat at a Delhi multiplex cost 500 rupees ($6; £4), nearly a third of his weekly pocket money.\"I enjoyed the movie, but the price was a sore point,\" he said. \"Popcorn was another 500 rupees, so I skipped it.\"He's not alone. Rising ticket and snack prices mean moviegoers are cutting down on their trips to cinema and moving towards cheaper streaming options.Harsh Verma, 38, looks back on a time when going to the movies didn't feel like a luxury.\"Some 15 years ago, my friends and I would go and watch every new release, sometimes every week. That has now become impossible.\"In the past five years, data shows that the average cost of a film ticket in India has risen by 47%.The Average Ticket Price (ATP) in 2020 was 91 rupees, while in 2024 it rose to 134, according to audience research firm Ormax media. However, between 2023 and 2024 there was only a 3% rise in the ATP - suggesting that the prices have stabilised.The report adds that footfall in Indian cinemas has reduced by 6% in 2024 as compared to 2023, continuing a trend in recent years. One of the main reasons why going to movies has become expensive is because single-screen theatres that offered cheaper tickets have now been mostly replaced by plush multi-screen cinemas that offer a host of amenities.But multiplex owners argue that ticket prices are reasonable and that audiences continue to visit in large numbers.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeople say popcorn and cola combo often costs more than the movie ticketSanjeev Kumar Bijli, executive director of multiplex chain PVR INOX Limited which owns more than 1,500 screens across India, told the BBC that the perception that people have stopped going to theatres is \"a general notion squeezed in without fact-checking\".He says his chain has recorded a footfall of 151 million in 2024, up from 140 million in 2023 and the numbers have been promising for this year as well. Mr Bijli acknowledges receiving some feedback about high ticket prices, but says that audiences continue to turn up because they get \"value for money\" - provided a film is good.\"People walk out after three hours feeling satisfied, they've enjoyed themselves in air-conditioned comfort, with superior sound and an immersive experience.\"Mr Bijli says many chains like his are using flexible pricing and weekday offers to attract audiences - for instance, tickets at PVR cost only 92 rupees on Tuesdays.Some Indian states have, however, also placed a cap on ticket prices, sparking a debate on whether this needs to be a nationwide regulation.Mr Bijli argues that price caps don't help them, as steady revenue is vital to maintain and upgrade facilities.Film critic Komal Nahta believes that while lower prices could attract more audiences, owners must retain the freedom to keep their businesses profitable.But, he adds that ticket rates shouldn't be so high that the masses are priced out. \"After all, it's the people who make the stars,\" he says.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesDelhi's iconic single-screen Regal Theatre permanently closed operations in 2017Meanwhile, experts says that even though single screens offer cheaper tickets, many urban middle-class audiences no longer choose them because they cannot match the comfort and amenities of multiplexes.\"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Nahta. \"Because footfalls are low, cinema owners can't afford proper maintenance. And since the theatres aren't well maintained, people don't want to watch movies there.\"In Delhi, only a handful of single screens still stand. The rest have either shut down or fallen into disrepair, their ageing structures and outdated facilities a reminder of a bygone era.Some patrons, however, remember single screens as simpler, more community spaces.\"There would be 800 to 1,000 people packed in together,\" recalls 61-year-old Renu Bhushan. \"The crowd would erupt when the star appeared on screen while vendors sold cheap snacks and drinks.\"But this nostalgia is not shared by everyone.Mr Verma, says after visiting both single screens and multiplexes over the past two decades, he prefers the latter. \"The seats [at single screens] are uncomfortable and the experience isn't great,\" he says.Annu Gupta also prefers multiplexes because they offer better facilities, clean toilets and security. Industry experts say theatres are also facing competition from cheaper streaming options which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic. As audiences kept away, many theatres went out of business. \"With affordable subscriptions, people now watch most big releases within six-to-eight weeks at their homes,\" says film trade expert and marketing analyst Girish Wankhede.A monthly subscription to a streaming platform costs less than two tickets in a multiplex. For families, the math is even clearer.But Mr Bijli of PVR says that with the pandemic a distant memory now, the audience behaviour is shifting again and people are returning to theatres.Cinema and streaming are meant to co-exist and this isn't the first time the industry has faced existential questions, he says.\"Cinema has faced challenges from TV, VHS and DVDs. Every time a new content medium emerged, people wrote off cinema, but it survived. \"It offers an immersive, uninterrupted experience that you simply can't get at home.\"Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: US \"looking at land now\" - Trump confirms CIA authorisation in Venezuela after boat strikesUS President Donald Trump has confirmed a report he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, provoking outrage from the South American nation's leader.US forces have already conducted at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing 27 people. UN-appointed human rights experts have described the raids as \"extrajudicial executions\".Speaking at the White House, Trump said the US \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes on drug cartels in the region. Nicolás Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested after disputed elections last year, appealed on TV for peace with the US.The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. According to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation would allow the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity. It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies, but the spy agency has a long history of activities in South America. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.\"Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?\" a journalist asked.\"I authorised for two reasons really,\" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about an intelligence organisation whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy. \"Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\" He added: \"And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.\"Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade. The president would not be drawn on whether the CIA's goal was to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty. \"Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\" he said. In the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast.On Truth Social, Trump said that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO [drug-trafficking organisation] drug-trafficking route\". As has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard. Maduro took to the airwaves on Wednesday night to warn against escalation.\"No to regime change, which reminds us so much of the endless, failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on,\" said the Socialist leader. \"No to CIA-orchestrated coups d'état.\"He added: \"Listen to me, no war, yes peace, the people United States.\"Earlier in the day Maduro ordered military exercises in the Caracas suburb of Petare and in neighbouring Miranda state on Wednesday. In a message on Telegram, he said he was mobilising the military, police and civilian militia to defend the oil-rich country.Foreign Minister Yván Gil said on Telegram that Venezuela \"rejects the warmongering and extravagant statements of the president of the United States\".\"We view with extreme alarm the use of the CIA, as well as the military deployments announced in the Caribbean, which amount to a policy of aggression, threat, and harassment against Venezuela,\" he added.Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims. Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and Assistant Undersecretary of Defense, told the BBC: \"In order to conduct covert action, there needs to be a presidential finding for the CIA specially authorizing it, with specific actions identified.\"Mulroy added that such a finding would mark a \"substantial increase\" in efforts against drug trafficking organizations.\"Perhaps a real life 'Sicario',\" he said, referring to a 2015 film that depicts US operatives launching clandestine operations against drug cartels in Mexico.(With additional reporting from Ione Wells)",

    "body": "21 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent andLiv McMahonBBC Technology JournalistReutersOpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to \"treat adult users like adults\",  says its boss Sam Altman.In a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way  - \"but only if you want it, not because we are usage maxxing\".The move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's xAI's recent introduction of two sexually explicit chatbots to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers.It is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions.OpenAI did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.Mr Altman said OpenAI had previously made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\".These changes were announced in a blog post in August, which no longer appears on OpenAI's website.\"We realise this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,\" Mr Altman posted on Tuesday.He said ChatGPT could soon relax the restrictions \"now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools\".He added: \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.\" The changes come after OpenAI was sued earlier this year by parents of a US teen who took his own life.The lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.The family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts.In a statement given at the time, OpenAI told the BBC it was reviewing the filing.\"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time,\" the company said.Child safety concernsWritten erotica does not require age verification in the UK under the Online Safety Act. However, pornographic images, including those generated by AI, would require users to prove they are over 18.In the US, critics say OpenAI's decision to allow erotica on the platform shows the need for more regulation at the federal and state levels.\"How are they going to make sure that children are not able to access the portions of ChatGPT that are adult-only and provide erotica?\" said Jenny Kim, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. Ms Kim is involved in a lawsuit against Meta that claims the company's Instagram's algorithm harms the mental health of teen users.\"OpenAI, like most of big tech in this space, is just using people like guinea pigs,\" she said. In April, TechCrunch reported that OpenAI was allowing accounts in which a user had registered as a minor to generate graphic erotica.OpenAI said at the time that the company was rolling out a fix to limit such content.A survey published this month by the nonprofit Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) found that one in five students report that they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with AI.On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature that would have blocked developers from offering AI chatbots companions to children unless the companies could guarantee the software wouldn't breed harmful behaviour.Newsom said it was \"imperative that adolescents learn how to safely interact with AI systems\" in a message that accompanied his veto.At the nationwide level, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots interact with children.In the US Senate last month, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would chatbot users to file liability claims against their developers.Why introduce erotica?Mr Altman's announcement on Tuesday comes as sceptics have been questioning the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies.OpenAI's revenue is growing, but it has never been profitable.Tulane University business professor Rob Lalka, author of The Venture Alchemists, said the major AI companies find themselves in a battle for market share.\"No company has ever had the kind of adoption that OpenAI saw with ChatGPT,\" Prof Lalka told BBC News. \"They needed to continue to push along that exponential growth curve, achieving market domination as much as they can,\" he added.",

    "body": "9 hours agoGary O'Donoghue in KyivIona Hampson/BBCTrain conductor Olha Zolotova was badly injured in a Russian strike on her trainPropped up in her hospital bed, railway conductor Olha Zolotova speaks slowly and quietly as she talks about the day her train was hit by a Russian drone.\"When the Shahed [drone] hit I was covered in rubble. I was in the second car. People pulled me out,\" she says.\"My eyes went dark. There was fire everywhere, everything was burning, my hair caught fire a little. I was trapped.\"Olha is a victim of Russia's increasingly frequent attacks on the Ukrainian railway system – vital infrastructure that keeps the country moving three and a half years since Moscow's full-scale invasion.Ukraine's 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway system is not merely a mode of transport, it is a central pillar of Ukraine's war effort and a powerful national symbol of resilience. Olha's injuries were severe, so she was transported more than 300km (185 miles) to a special hospital in the capital, Kyiv, dedicated to railway workers. She has just had surgery on her hip and a metal plate inserted into her leg.Kat Werner/BBCRussia is increasing its strikes on Ukraine's vast and vital rail networkHer train was hit earlier this month at a station in Shostka in the northern Sumy region.As rescue workers sought to tend to the injured, a second Russian drone struck the station – a type of hit known as a \"double tap\".Ukraine says civilians and rescue teams were directly targeted, which would constitute a possible war crime under international law.Thirty people in total were hurt. Of those treated in hospital, three were children, and one man was found dead, possibly from a heart attack.According to national rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ), there were twice as many attacks in September as there were in August - not just on trains but on the infrastructure that supports the rail network.In fact, half of the attacks on the railways since the beginning of the war have taken place in the past two months, says Oleksiy Balesta, a deputy minister at the department that oversees the rail network.\"Almost every day for the last two months, we have been experiencing targeted attacks on Ukrzaliznytsia infrastructure and on power transmission facilities,\" he says.Balesta suggests Russia has been \"hunting for locomotives - deliberately targeting both freight and passenger trains\".Behind the deputy minister is a wrecked locomotive, part of Ukraine's intercity fleet that was targeted in eastern Kyiv on one particularly devastating night at the end of August.The attack also included a strike on a key rail junction in Koziatyn in the central Vinnytsia region, creating delays and forcing significant diversions.As he speaks, Balesta receives a message from his assistant. There has been another attack on a train between Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in the eastern Donetsk region, close to the front line.Already today there have been three bomb threats on other services, forcing staff to evacuate the trains until explosives experts have given the all clear.Officials here point to two principal factors which they believe have led to this intensified spate of attacks.First, Russia's increasing capacity to produce large numbers of relatively cheap Shahed-type drones each day, which are increasingly able to fly greater distances.Then there is the near stalemate on the front line - and the consequent shift in focus by the Russian army to disrupt supply lines instead.\"It's a very clear battle for the railways,\" says Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, chief executive of UZ.\"The enemy is trying to stop us completely. This is part of a war tactic meant to cause panic among civilians, destroy our economy, and make the country unliveable.\"Repairing damage as fast as possible, co-ordinating with the military and training its staff to recognise potential sabotage threats are all key to Ukraine's response, says Pertsovskyi.\"Lastly, we always have Plan B, C and D. The goal is never to cancel a single service or destination. If a train can't run, we combine trains and buses.\"On top of the practicalities, there is also a clear eye on the morale of passengers.\"Recently, a train from Kyiv to Sumy had to be rerouted, adding six hours due to safety reasons,\" says the UZ chief.\"A passenger posted on social media that she'd be spending her birthday on the train instead of with her boyfriend - but said she understood. We sent her a cake and flowers.\"The constant threat of missiles and drones means flying people and supplies around the country is nearly impossible. Much of the grain and iron ore exports that Ukraine's economy depends on is moved by train to the southern Black Sea ports, and westward through Poland.Visiting political leaders from all around the world also all enter the country by train – \"iron diplomacy\", as Ukrainians call it. The workers who have been caught up in attacks are called \"iron heroes\".Kat Werner/BBCKyiv central station is a major hub in Ukraine's rail networkIn the grandeur of Kyiv's central station, another government minister awards certificates of bravery to the latest group of Iron Heroes - those who fought the fires on the night the intercity depot was attacked.\"It was very scary because there was a lot of fire and damage,\" says Oleksandr Leonenko, who helped extinguish the flames. He proudly shows me his certificate and says it will mean some extra pay.The uptick of attacks on the railway has coincided with Russia targeting Ukraine's power infrastructure. One recent set of attacks left hundreds of thousands without electricity.Ukraine has meanwhile launched a series of attacks on Russian oil refineries and claims to have inflicted petrol shortages in many areas.As Ukrainians eye their fourth winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began, UZ's Oleksandr Pertsovskyi believes the attacks on their infrastructure could bring about the hardest winter yet.In a message echoed by many Ukrainian officials, he calls on the country's allies to supply stronger air defences.\"But we're not desperate. We're preparing mentally and practically. Ukrainians remain strong in spirit.\"That spirit looks set to be tested to the limit in the coming months.Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk and Anastasiia Levchenko",

    "body": "China arrested 30 Christians. Some fear it's the start of a bigger crackdown10 hours agoTessa WongAsia Digital Reporter andKelly NgReutersJin Mingri, seen here in a 2018 file photo, is one of 30 Christians arrested in China last weekendLast Friday Grace Jin Drexel received a text from her father in China, the prominent pastor Jin Mingri, telling her to pray for another pastor who had gone missing.The text said that the other pastor had been detained while visiting the southern  city of Shenzhen.\"Shortly after that, I got a call from my mum. She said she couldn't contact my dad,\" Ms Jin Drexel, who lives in the US, told the BBC. Within hours her family realised that Mr Jin had also been caught up in what has been described by activists as China's largest arrest of Christians in decades.Some now fear that last weekend's roundup of 30 Christians linked to the Zion Church network, which Mr Jin founded, marks the start of what could be a wider crackdown on underground churches.They point to new laws passed in China which appear aimed at curbing underground church activity, and increasing pressure exerted by authorities on church members in recent months.Despite being ruled by the atheist Chinese Communist Party, China has a sizeable Christian population. Government figures in recent years have stated there are about 38 million Protestants and nearly six million Catholics.But these figures likely only account for members of churches registered with the officially approved Catholic Patriotic Association and the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which emphasise loyalty to China and the Communist Party.Rights activists and scholars estimate that tens of millions more Chinese attend unregistered churches, also known as house churches, which do not follow state-sanctioned ideologies.Many of these churches have been impacted by the Chinese government's attempts to increase its control of religious groups over the years. Church buildings have been demolished and crosses have been removed from public view, while religious material has become more tightly policed, with some Christian apps banned in China.In 2005 and again in 2018, the government revised and tightened regulations on religious groups, while in 2016, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the \"sinicisation\" of religion.Underground churches such as Zion were especially affected by the 2018 rules, which required government approval for worshipping in public. Many were forced to stop public activities and turned to holding online services, or simply shut down.The following years also saw the arrests and sentencing of a few prominent pastors.In recent months, there have been signs of Chinese authorities once again tightening the screws. In May, pastor Gao Quanfu of the Light of Zion Church in Xi'an was detained on charges of \"using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of law\". The following month saw several members of the Linfen Golden Lampstand Church in Shanxi sentenced to years in prison for fraud, which rights groups have criticised as false convictions.Then in September, authorities announced a new online code of conduct for religious personnel, which only allows online sermons to be conducted by licensed groups. This has been widely seen as an attempt to curtail underground churches' online services.In the last few months, Zion church members have also faced increasing questioning by police officers, Ms Jin Drexel said.Many in Zion saw the stepped-up pressure as a prelude to a crackdown, but few anticipated it would be as large as it turned out to be, she said.Last Friday and Saturday, Chinese authorities launched what's been described as a sweeping crackdown across at least 10 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Besides Mr Jin who was taken from his main base in Beihai city in Guangxi province, they arrested other pastors, leaders and members of the congregation, according to the church.CSWPolice officers arresting pastor Sun Cong of Zion Church (centre) were seen going through his booksThe BBC has obtained a copy of what appears to be an official detention notice for Mr Jin, issued by the public security bureau in Beihai. It states that Mr Jin is currently held in the Beihai Number Two prison and that he is suspected of \"illegal use of information networks\".The BBC has asked local authorities to confirm the detention.Some of the arrested church members have since been released, but the majority are thought to still be in detention, with some housed in the same prison as Mr Jin.Corey Jackson, founder of Christian advocacy group Luke Alliance, said the nationwide scale and co-ordination of the arrests across China were unprecedented.\"We anticipate that this is just the beginning of a larger crackdown,\" he said, adding that other underground churches in China were now preparing themselves for arrests.Another Christian advocacy group, Open Doors, said the arrests were significant. \"Zion Church was very well known and outspoken and it may have reached the level of organisation that authorities are getting nervous about organised social entities they do not control,\" a spokesperson said.He warned that China's \"policy of acting against house churches will continue\" and that authorities may accuse more church members of fraud and economic crimes \"as a strategy of intimidation\".Sean Long, a Zion Church pastor and spokesperson based in the US, said other churches will be targeted as there is \"a new wave of religious persecution emerging quickly across China\".He called the latest arrests a \"systematic roundup\" to \"unroot Zion\", and quoted the Chinese idiom \"killing the chicken to scare the monkeys\".\"Zion is the chicken, we are the most influential... it's to scare other Christians and house churches in China.\"When asked by the BBC for a response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said: \"We would like to stress that the Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief in accordance with law. Meanwhile, all religious groups and religious activities must comply with the laws and regulations of China.\"Earlier this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it \"firmly opposes the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues\", in response to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's condemnation of the Zion church arrests.Getty ImagesChina officially has 38 million Protestants and six million Catholics, but tens of millions more Chinese are believed to attend underground churchesZion's story began with Jin Mingri, also known as Ezra Jin. Born in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, he was a believer in the Chinese state while growing up.That changed in 1989 when, as a student in the prestigious Beijing University, he began taking part in the pro-democracy movement that was eventually crushed in the Tiananmen Massacre.While he did not happen to be at Tiananmen on 4 June, the events at the square changed his life. \"It was a pivotal moment. For his whole life, he had faith in the state. When that was betrayed, it shattered his entire world view. It was a big come-to-Jesus moment,\" Ms Jin Drexel said.At first Mr Jin pursued his new Christian faith at a Three-Self church. In 2002 he moved to the US with his wife and daughter to study at a seminary in California, where his two sons were born.The family moved back to China in 2007 for Mr Jin to continue his work. But he decided to set up an independent church,  said Ms Jin Drexel, as he could no longer accept the Three-Self doctrine which calls for allegiance to the Chinese state. \"He couldn't be a pastor there as it was not a God-pleasing church... you can't serve two masters.\"Zion began as a small house church in Beijing with just 20 followers. But over the years it expanded and began holding services in a large hall in an office building. As it grew in influence, so did the scrutiny. In 2018, Chinese authorities asked the church to install CCTV cameras in the building, saying it was for \"security\". When it refused, followers began facing what church leaders say was harassment. Later that year, the church was shut down.An exit ban was imposed on Mr Jin, who was placed under close surveillance. His family was able to leave for the US, as did some other church members such as Mr Long.Zion then pivoted to what Mr Long called a \"hybrid model\" where they would hold large online church services coupled with small offline meetings in person. The church grew to about 100 branches across 40 cities in China, and has more than 10,000 followers now.It is why, while the fate of Mr Jin and the other arrested church members remains uncertain and the possibility of a wider crackdown looms, Mr Long is confident that Zion and China's underground churches will survive.\"Persecution cannot destroy the church,\" he said. \"If you look back to history, where there is repression, there's a revival.\"Read more of our China coverage",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesSpain is kicking against the prevailing political mood among Western nations when it comes to migration and policies regarding the African continent.At a time when the US, the UK, France and Germany are all cutting back their development aid budgets, Madrid remains committed to continued expansion, albeit from a lower starting point.This week, the Spanish capital has been hosting an African Union-backed \"world conference on people of African descent\". AfroMadrid2025 will discuss restorative justice and the creation of a new development fund.It is just the latest sign of how Spain's socialist-led government is seeking to deepen and diversify its engagement with the continent and near neighbour that lies just a few kilometres to the south, across the Straits of Gibraltar.In July Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares launched a new advisory council of prominent intellectual, diplomatic and cultural figures, more than half of them African, to monitor the delivery of the detailed Spain-Africa strategy that his government published at the end of last year.New embassies south of the Sahara, and partnerships in business and education are planned.The contrast between Spain's approach and that of others in the West is not just in spending but in tone and mindset – and nowhere more so than in dealing with migration.Similar to elsewhere in Europe, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is looking for ways to contain the influx of irregular arrivals.Like other centre-left and centre-right leaders, he finds himself facing an electoral challenge from the radical right, largely driven by some voters' concern over migration, with the hardline Vox party well established in parliament and routinely ranking third in opinion polls.In July, extra security forces had to be deployed against racist gangs roaming the streets of Torre Pacheco, in Murcia region – where many Africans work in the booming horticultural sector – after three Moroccans were accused of beating a pensioner.While the opposition conservative People's Party remains favourable to some immigration, but for cultural reasons wants to prioritise Latin Americans rather than Africans, Vox has been more radical.Responding to the Murcia incident Vox called for a crackdown on immigrants taking up less skilled jobs. The message largely targeted Africans working in fruit and vegetable production, now so crucial to the southern Spanish economy.But for the government the migration presents challenges that are as much practical as political.AFP via Getty ImagesThousands try to make the crossing to the Canary Islands on packed wooden boatsMore than 45,000 people made the perilous sea crossing from Africa's west coast to the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands last year. Estimates of those who died while making the attempt range between 1,400 and a staggering 10,460.Others make the shorter journey across the Gibraltar Straits or the Mediterranean to land on Andalusian beaches or try to scramble over the border fences of Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclave towns on the North African coast.The Spanish administration has to accommodate new arrivals, process their claims and manage their absorption into wider society, whether temporary or more long-lasting.However, in language markedly different from the hostile messaging that emanates from many European capitals, the Sanchez government openly acknowledges the hard economic realities on the ground in West Africa that push people to risk their lives in the effort to reach Europe.And it is trying to move beyond simply saying \"no\" to new arrivals. Instead, it is developing creative alternatives, with a promise to foster movements of people that are safe, orderly and regular and \"mutually beneficial\".On his trip to Mauritania last year, Sanchez stressed the contribution that migrants make to the Spanish economy.\"For us, the migratory phenomenon is not only a question of moral principles, solidarity and dignity, but also one of rationality,\" the prime minister said.The Spanish government funds training schemes for unemployed youth in countries such as Senegal, especially for irregular migrants who have been sent back, to help them develop viable new livelihoods back home.And it has expanded a \"circular migration\" programme that gives West Africans short-term visas to come to Spain for limited periods of seasonal work, mainly in agriculture, and then return.These issues were at the heart of the agenda when Sanchez visited Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania in August last year.A circular migration agreement with the former had been in place since 2021, but similar accords with the Mauritanian and Gambian governments have since followed.The underlying case for this singular approach was set out in detail in the foreign ministry's Spain-Africa strategy. This argued that Europe and Africa \"form part of the same geopolitical space\".But the management of migration is only one motive for the Spanish decision to place emphasis on building relations with Africa – and indeed support a much broader related social-cultural agenda.AFP via Getty ImagesSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R) met Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (L) in Madrid last yearThe fundamental premise underlying Madrid's outreach is that Spain, as the European country closest to the continent, has an essential self interest in Africa's progress towards inclusive and sustainable development, and peace and security.That basic rationale might seem obvious.Yet of course history had taken Spain down a quite different path.Other than a few Maghreb footholds and a small tropical outpost – today's independent Equatorial Guinea – its colonial expansion in the 16th and 17th Centuries had mainly been directed across the Atlantic.And over recent decades, European affairs and the Middle East had tended to dominate Madrid's foreign policy priorities, while the main beneficiaries of its development support were the countries of its vast former empire in Central and South America.However, the past few years have seen the Sanchez government preside over a fundamental broadening of outlook.Barely had Albares been installed as foreign minister in July 2021 than he launched a restructuring of his department, in part to strengthen its engagement not only with Latin America but also with the Sahel and North Africa.Confirmation of the wider geographical emphasis came with a development co-operation plan for 2024-27, which for the first time, designated West Africa, including the Sahel, as one of three regions prioritised for assistance, alongside Central and South America.Spain's Africa strategy lays heavy emphasis not just on economic sectors such as infrastructure, digitalisation and energy transition but also particularly on education and youth employment.The cultural dimension includes not only promotion of the Spanish language, with an expanded presence of the Cervantes Institute, but also programmes to help the mobility of academic teachers and researchers.Security co-operation, action on climate change, women's empowerment and an expanded diplomatic presence are unsurprising components in today's environment.However, the strategy also lays very public stress it places on supporting democratic ideas, the African Union and, in particular, the West African regional organisation Ecowas.This will be welcome public encouragement for the latter, which is currently under severe pressure after seeing its 50th anniversary year marred by the walk-out of the Sahelian states – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – whose ruling military juntas have refused to comply with its protocol on democracy and good governance.Meanwhile, in a message targeted as much at Madrid's domestic audience as its sub-Saharan partners, the foreign ministry said \"supporting the African diaspora and the fight against racism and xenophobia are also key priorities\".Fine words of course are only a first step. But in today's sour international climate such language really does stand out.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.You may also be interested in:Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy'Try or die' - one man's determination to get to the Canary Islands'I found out on social media that my son had died'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoJeremy BowenInternational editor'We want to raise our children': Life in Gaza after hostages and prisoners releasedDonald Trump's quick trip to Israel and Egypt was the victory lap he wanted.Anyone watching the speeches he made in Jerusalem and Sharm el-Sheikh could see a man luxuriating in his power - enjoying the applause in Israel's parliament, and in Egypt, basking in the fact that so many heads of state and government had flown in. One veteran diplomat in the room said it looked as if Trump saw the role of the world leaders there as extras on his film set.Trump's message at Sharm was, in effect, that he had created a historical turning point.\"All I've done all my life is deals. The greatest deals just sort of happen… That's what happened right here. And maybe this is going to be the greatest deal of them all,\" he said. Observers might also have had the impression from the speeches that the job is done. It is not.Without question, Trump can claim credit for the ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. Qatar, Turkey and Egypt used their leverage with Hamas to force it to accept. That made it a joint effort, but Trump's role was decisive. Live coverage of this storyWithout his push to demand Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's agreement to terms that he had previously rejected, the deal would not have been signed.It helps to recognise what the deal is – and what it isn't. The agreement was for a ceasefire and an exchange of hostages for prisoners. It is not a peace agreement, or even the start of a peace process.The next phase of the Trump 20-point plan requires an agreement filling in the gaps of the framework which declares that the Gaza Strip will be demilitarised, secured and governed by a committee including Palestinians. It will report to a Board of Peace chaired by President Trump. Significant work needs to be done on the detail needed to make that happen.The Gaza agreement is not a route map to peace in the Middle East, the ultimate and so far, unreachable destination.ReutersNetanyahu called Trump the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White HouseJust as seriously, there is no evidence of the political will necessary to make a real peace deal. Most wars end with exhausted belligerents making some kind of agreement. The war in Gaza has become one of those, if as Trump has declared, it really is over.The other way to end a war is with a total victory that lets the winners dictate the way ahead. The best example is the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945.Before 9 September, when Netanyahu ordered a missile strike on Qatar he seemed to still be intent on crushing Israel's enemy so comprehensively, that Israel would be able to dictate the future of Gaza. The strike infuriated Trump. Qatar is one of America's key allies in the region, and the site of the biggest US military base in the Middle East. It is also a place where his sons have been doing lucrative business. Trump dismissed Netanyahu's justification that the target, which was missed, was the Hamas leadership, not Qatar. For Trump, America's interests come before Israel's. He is not like Joe Biden, who was prepared to accept harm to America's position in the region as the necessary price for supporting Israel.CCTV captures moment of Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in DohaTrump is back in Washington DC. Diplomats say the Americans realise that getting the detail sorted out is vital and will not happen quickly. The problem is that they might not have enough time. Ceasefires always get violated in their early stages. The ones that survive tend to be based on a tight agreements, made by warring parties who have decided that their best option is to make them work.The danger is that the Gaza ceasefire lacks those underpinnings. Only 24 hours after Israelis and Palestinians, for very different reasons, shared joy and relief that hostages, prisoners and detainees were home, cracks are appearing in the ceasefire.Hamas has, so far, returned only seven of the bodies of the 28 hostages who were killed during their incarceration. Its explanation is that it is very hard to find their graves in the sea of rubble that Israel has created in Gaza.Israel's patience is thin. The fate of the bodies of the hostages will become a bigger and bigger issue in Israel if their remains are not repatriated.As a first response, Israel has said that until Hamas fulfils its obligations it will cut the flow of aid into Gaza in half, and will not reopen Gaza's border crossing with Egypt - the Rafah crossing.Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's extremist ultranationalist finance minister who opposes the Gaza deal, posted on social media that \"only military pressure brings back hostages\".The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) still occupies 53% of the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, its soldiers killed Palestinians who they said were approaching their forces. Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza told the BBC that seven people were killed in two incidents.It could be that the IDF is still observing the rules of engagement that it was using before the ceasefire. They order troops to watch two imaginary lines around their positions. If one is crossed, they fire warning shots. If Palestinians continue to approach their positions and cross a second imaginary line, IDF troops can shoot to kill. A big problem with the system is that Palestinians do not know where the lines are. It is crowd control with live fire.As for Hamas, it is reasserting its power. Its men, armed and masked are back on the streets. It has attacked rival armed clans, some of which have been protected by the IDF. Videos have circulated of Hamas killing blindfolded and kneeling men who they have accused of collaborating with the Israelis. The grisly videos of extra-judicial executions in the street send a message to any Palestinians who want to defy them that they should not dare - and to the outside world that Hamas has survived Israel's onslaught.ReutersGaza City has been reduced to grey rubblePoint 15 of the Trump plan for Gaza says the US \"will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza\". Raising and deploying that force will be impossible if the ceasefire is not solid. Potential contributors will not send in their troops to use force to disarm Hamas.Hamas has hinted it might give up some heavy weapons but will not be disarmed. It has an ideology of Islamic resistance to Israel, and knows that without weapons its Palestinian enemies will come for revenge. Netanyahu has threatened that if no-one else will do it, Israel will finish the job. Hamas's weapons have to go, he has said, the \"easy way or the hard way\".Trump has proclaimed that his Gaza deal, as it stands, will end generations of conflict between Arabs and Jews over the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He insists too that it will lead to a broader peace across the Middle East. If he really believes that the job of making peace is done, then he is deluding himself. Just trying needs sustained focus, hard diplomatic work and a decision by the two sides in the fight that the time has come to make painful sacrifices and compromises. To make peace, other dreams have to be jettisoned.Past American presidents have also believed that they can make peace in the Middle East. Trump will discover that peace is not made just because a president, however powerful, decides that it is going to happen.",

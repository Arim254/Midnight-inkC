    "body": "19 hours agoAna FaguyWatch: Surveillance video shows suspect setting Pennsylvania governor's mansion on fireThe man accused of setting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence on fire in April was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in state prison as part of a plea deal. Cody Balmer, 38, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, aggravated arson, 22 counts of arson, burglary and other offenses at a court hearing on Tuesday. While the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged during the fire, people home at the time - including Shapiro, his wife, his four children, and guests and staff members - were able to escape unscathed.Shapiro said his family was supportive of the plea agreement announced by prosecutors.The attack against the governor and his family is part of a wave of political violence in the US, including attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, the killings of two Minnesota state officials and the killing of commentator Charlie Kirk. At a press conference on Tuesday, the Pennsylvania governor - standing alongside his wife - said his family has had to lean on their faith as they navigated a difficult recovery since the attack.“We will forever be changed by this, we know that time will heal, but the scars will remain,” Shapiro said.Balmer was accused of breaking into the govenor's residence and setting it on fire on the second day of Passover. The governor, who is Jewish, had hosted a Passover celebration the night before. Getty ImagesThe gutted interior of the governor's residenceBalmer had admitted to officials that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails he used in the attack, Pennsylvania State Police said.He turned himself in 13 hours after the break-in and admitted to “harbouring hatred toward Governor Shapiro”, officials said. Balmer was asked in a police interview what he would have done if he had come face to face with Shapiro. He told police he would have beaten the governor with a hammer, according to an affidavit. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.The Democrat was among the top picks to be Kamala Harris's running mate during the 2024 presidential election, but was ultimately passed over. He has frequently been mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate.Getty Images",

    "body": "Two French nationals have been handed lengthy prison sentences by a court in Iran after being convicted of espionage, Iranian state media reports.The reports do not name the defendants but they are believed to be Cecile Kohler, 40, and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, the only French nationals being held in Iran. They were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip. The pair have been found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, the reports say.The announcement comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete.Iran has previously said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Another French tourist, Olivier Grondeau, 34, was released by Iran earlier this year after being handed a five-year prison sentence for \"conspiracy against the Islamic republic\".Iran's judicial news agency Mizan said one of the defendants was sentenced to six years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiracy against national security and 20 years in exile for \"intelligence co-operation\" with Israel.The other was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiring against national security and 20 years in exile for being complicit in intelligence co-operation with Israel.Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently. It is unclear what \"exile\" entails, though in other instances convicts have been sent to remote areas.Mizan reports that their pre-trial detention would be deducted from their sentences and that the verdict could be contested within 20 days.France has accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily and keeping them in conditions akin to torture. Iran denies the claims.Human rights groups say tourists and dual nationals are often held for leverage in diplomatic negotiations, released only when Iran gets something in return.The release of British-Iranian nationals Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori in 2022, after years in detention, came after months of negotiation that saw the UK settle a debt of nearly £400m dating from the 1970s.Kohler and Paris were touted as exchangeable for Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media. Iran has repeatedly called her detention arbitrary.Iran is thought to currently hold around 20 Europeans in detention, according to news agency AFP.These include British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman, who were detained in January while travelling through Iran on a motorcycling world tour and later charged with espionage.Their family maintains they are innocent and are being held in \"horrific conditions\".Last week, 18-year-old French-German cyclist Lennart Monterlos was released after an Iranian court acquitted him of espionage charges.",

    "body": "The US Supreme Court has rejected a request from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to overturn the nearly $1.5bn (£1.1bn) defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to make the payout in 2022 for claiming the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School - which killed 20 schoolchildren and six educators - was a hoax. In order to make that payout, Jones was being forced to sell his Infowars media company to the satirical news site The Onion. He told the highest US court the sale would cause irreparable harm to him and his audience of 30 million.Jones has not yet paid any of the damages he owes Sandy Hook families.The Supreme Court did not explain its decision to deny his request. Jones’s lawyers had made a free speech argument - that he should have the same protections under the First Amendment of the Constitution that journalists have. And Jones argued the financial consequences were too steep.\"The result is a financial death penalty by fiat imposed on a media defendant whose broadcasts reach millions,\" he told the Supreme Court in the appeal. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, said in a statement provided to BBC that the court “properly rejected Jones's latest desperate attempt to avoid accountability for the harm he has caused. \"We look forward to enforcing the jury's historic verdict and making Jones and Infowars pay for what they have done.\"While The Onion's attempt to buy Infowars was rejected by a bankruptcy judge last year, Infowars could soon be up for sale again, giving The Onion another chance. Legal pressure against Jones has been mounting since he was found liable by two juries for defamation and emotional distress over his lies about the Sandy Hook school shooting. After the first verdict in Connecticut, Jones filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas, and Infowars was put up for auction to pay the Sandy Hook families, who had sued to collect on the judgment.It was during Texas court proceedings that Jones acknowledged the attack was \"100% real\". He had previously claimed the massacre was \"staged\" as part of a government plot to take guns from Americans and that \"no-one died\". ",

    "body": "7 hours agoKoh EweChina CustomsCustoms officers recently seized a batch of maps bound for export, which they described as \"problematic\"Chinese customs officers in eastern Shandong province have seized 60,000 maps that \"mislabelled\" the self-governed island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. The maps, authorities said, also \"omitted important islands\" in the South China Sea, where Beijing's claims overlap with those of its neighbours, including the Philippines and Vietnam.The \"problematic\" maps, meant for export, cannot be sold because they \"endanger national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of China, authorities said.Maps are a sensitive topic for China and its rivals for reefs, islands and outcrops in the South China Sea.China Customs said that the maps also did not contain the nine-dash line, which demarcates Beijing's claim over nearly the entire South China Sea.The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan.The seized maps also did not mark the maritime boundary between China and Japan, authorities said.Authorities said the maps mislabelled \"Taiwan province\", without specifying what exactly the mislabelling was.China sees self-ruled Taiwan its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.Tensions in the South China Sea flare up occassionally - most recently over the weekend, when ships from China and the Philippines figured in another encounter.Manila accused a Chinese ship of deliberately ramming and firing its water cannon at a Philippine government vessel.But Beijing said the incident happened after the Philippine vessel ignored repeated warnings and \"dangerously approached\" the Chinese ship.The Philippines and Vietnam are also particularly sensitive to depictions of the South China Sea in maps.The Barbie movie from 2023 was banned in Vietnam and censored in the Philippines for showing a South China Sea map with the nine dash line.The statement from China Customs did not say where the seized maps were intended to be sold. China supplies much of the world's goods, from Christmas lights to stationery.The confiscation of \"problematic maps\" by Chinese customs officers is not uncommon - though the number of the maps seized in Shandong easily eclipses past seizures. Goods that fail inspection at the customs are destroyed.In March, customs officers at an airport in Qingdao seized a batch of 143 nautical charts that contained \"obvious errors\" in the national borders.In August, customs officers in Hebei province seized two \"problematic maps\" that, among other things, contained a \"misdrawing\" of the Tibetan border.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSayeda AkterBBC Bangla, Dhaka andKelly NgSingaporeAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered and would be handed to families after DNA testing, as they have been burnt beyond recognition, the fire service said.Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Most of the deaths were caused by toxic gas and the building's roof door being locked, the fire service said.Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died \"instantly\" after inhaling \"highly toxic gas\". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation into whether the warehouse was operating legally was also ongoing, he added.The fire service said that the chemical warehouse had no fire safety clearance or licence from their department. Meanwhile, officials in northern Dhaka had confirmed that the warehouse had no occupancy certificate or licence to operate, local media reported.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her... I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.Bangladesh has a long history of deadly industrial disasters. In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found.In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.The country's deadliest industrial accident to date took place in 2013, when the eight-storey Rana Plaza building housing garment factories near Dhaka collapsed owing to a structural failure, killing more than 1,100 people.",

    "body": "15 hours agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics\". This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?What is Trump's goal as US bombs 'Venezuela drugs boat'?Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. It has also deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence. Many lawyers questioning the legality of such military action.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers – for example killing \"enemy fighters\" even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.The strikes come after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges.Venezuela's government has reacted to previous recent strikes with anger. Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.",

His three albums won four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D’Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner.Fellow musicians Beyoncé, Nile Rogers and Lauryn Hill were among those paying their respects.'Strength and sensitivity'Singer Beyoncé thanked D’Angelo for his music on her website. \"You were the pioneer of neo-soul, and that changed and transformed rhythm and blues forever,\" she wrote. \"We will never forget you.\"Writing about his first meeting with D'Angelo, guitarist and producer Rogers recalled having encouraged the late star - who was then on the way up - to put out his material as it was \"perfect\".\"About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was genius and it was exactly what he had played for me,\" wrote Rogers. \"I know... I still have the original cassette.\"Singer and rapper Hill, who worked with D'Angelo at the start of his career, shared a similarly lengthy and personal reflection, saying his \"beauty and talent were not of this world\".\"You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,\" she wrote.Fellow rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot also paid their respects, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. \"Rest Peacefully D'Angelo,\" posted Elliot, who was becoming one of hip-hop's biggest around the same time as the soul singer's rise in the late 1990s.Scott posted: \"I never met D'Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift.\"Hudson noted how \"we lost a true original today\". \"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "24 hours agoBruno BoelpaepIn Brussels andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPolice used water cannon and tear gas at one point when the protest turned violentTens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Brussels as part of a national strike over government reforms and spending cuts that has brought flights to a halt and severely disrupted public transport.Belgium's three big unions are protesting over pensions and other measures by Prime Minister Bart de Wever's centre-right government aimed at cutting the budget deficit.There were no services at Belgium's second biggest airport at Charleroi, and all departures and many of the arrivals were cancelled at Brussels Airport.Although trains were running, most buses, trams and underground trains in the capital ground to a halt.Shipping at Europe's second biggest port Antwerp was suspended until Wednesday because of understaffing, and more than 100 ships waited in the North Sea for permission to dock at three ports, according to Belgium's MDK maritime and coastal services.Belgium has been hit by several strikes since Flemish nationalist Bart de Wever came to office last February.By midday, police said 80,0000 protesters had joined the demonstration in the Belgian capital.ReutersDemonstrators held a banner that read \"social health: vital\"Public sector workers were protesting against austerity measures and a government increasingly perceived as leaning right.They wound through the streets of central Brussels, many wearing the red or green colours of the main unions. A key issue for the unions is the government's plan to increase the number of days Belgians work per year before they can receive their pensions, as well as the end of special schemes for several sectors including military and railway workers. De Wever's government has also announced measures including a maximum two-year limit on claiming unemployment benefit. Further cuts are planned for next year's budget, and some proposals such as reducing child benefit or raising VAT have already been floated.\"It's about time we came together,\" said Anaïs, 29. \"It's always the same part of the population that has to tighten their belts.\"Bruno Boelpaep/BBCAnaïs complained that the government's pension reforms would not affect wealthier BelgiansHolding a placard showing the number 67 with a red line through it, she objected to the pension age going up: \"65 is enough. 67 is too late. We are asked to work more, to work longer hours. It's not fair.\"The rise in pension age was adopted 10 years ago, well before De Wever's government came to office, but it remains deeply unpopular and the government is aiming to ringfence it and make it more expensive to retire earlier.Thierry Bodson of the ABVV union told demonstrators that \"the fight against the De Wever government is not just the fight of a day or a year - it's for a whole generation\", Belga news agency reported.\"We need to fight for our rights,\" said mother-of-two Vanessa, who had travelled from Charleroi. \"I'm worried about the measures that will be taken. What sort of future will my children have?\" she told the BBC.It is not just the federal government under pressure to cut spending. Belgium's complex multi-level governance means regional authorities are also imposing austerity measures. The ruling coalition in Belgium's largely French-speaking Walloon region has announced that teachers in the higher tiers of secondary schools will have to work an extra two hours per week. Many of them joined the protests today.\"Nothing is clear, and it's really worrying, but if higher-level teachers have to work more, many jobs will be cut,\" said Sandrine, 48, who works in education.Although the protests were largely peaceful, there were several incidents of vandalism and arson early in the morning and some people in masks clashed with police later on.",

    "body": "20 hours agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu announced the planned suspension two days before his new government faced votes of confidenceFrench Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has told parliament he backs suspending controversial 2023 pension reforms, in the face of crucial votes of no-confidence later this week.The changes, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, were seen as signature reforms in Emmanuel Macron's presidency.\"This autumn I will propose to parliament that we suspend the 2023 pension reform until the [2027] presidential election,\" Lecornu said to applause from left-wing parties.Lecornu was reappointed prime minister last week only four days after he resigned, and needs the support of Socialist MPs in parliament if his government is to survive.Opposition parties on the far right and far left have called confidence votes, known as \"censure\" votes on Lecornu's government, for Thursday morning and are demanding parliamentary elections.The Socialists said they would be prepared to support the new government, but only if it promises a complete suspension of Macron's pension changes.\"If he does not explicitly say the words 'immediate and complete suspension of the pension reform', it will be censure,\" Socialist MP Laurent Baumel said earlier on French TV.\"He is holding his destiny in his own hands. He knows what he has do if he doesn't want to be the prime minister who resigns every week.\"The reforms were finally pushed through parliament in March 2023, less than a year after Macron was voted in for a second presidential term.There had been months of political debate, strikes and street protests, and in the end the bill had to go through without a vote in parliament using a constitutional mechanism known as 49:3. Last week, Lecornu said it was something many French people remembered as a \"wound on democracy\" .On Tuesday he made it plain to MPs that suspending the pension reform would cost €400m (£350m) in 2026 and a further €1.8bn (£1.57bn) in 2027. This will have to be \"compensated by other savings,\" Lecornu said.Lecornu is France's third prime minister in the past year but even if he does survive he needs to get a budget through parliament that brings down a budget deficit heading for 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year. France's public debt earlier this year stood at €3.4tn, or almost 114% of GDP, the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.Lecornu has been one of Macron's most loyal allies, so his decision to row back on such a contested reform shows how keen the president is to avoid further turmoil.Philippe Aghion, who was jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday, said earlier that he also backed a suspension of the pension reform, because it would still come at a smaller cost than the instability that would follow another government collapse.\"We're living through an era of crisis,\" Lecornu told MPs. \"Some people want the situation to turn into a regime crisis, but that won't happen.\"Promising a \"serious and reliable budget\", the prime minister also vowed to bring an end to reliance on the 49:3 mechanism to push through legal changes without a vote. Since late 2022, every budget has had to be forced through without a vote.Repeatedly, he told the chamber that \"the government will propose, we will debate and you will vote\".Parliament will have \"the final word\", he said.To audible groans from MPs, Lecornu proposed a working group to look into pensions, and said it would have to come to a decision by the time of the next presidential election.France's budget deficit is far above the EU target of 3% of GDP, and Lecornu said that reversing the pension reform would have to be \"financially compensated, including through cost-saving measures. It cannot be carried out at the expense of an increased deficit\".Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally (RN) and the radical-left France Unbowed (LFI) of Jean-Luc Mélenchon have both tabled confidence votes in Lecornu's government on Thursday, but would need the support of centre-left parties to bring him down.The RN's Sébastien Chenu confirmed his party would vote against Lecornu later this week. \"We are not fooled by anything and cannot be bought,\" he said. \"Hello and goodbye, Mr Prime Minister.\"Mathilde Panot of France Unbowed also railed against Lecornu and Macron. \"Nobody believes in you any longer,\" she said.But a triumphant Boris Vallaud of the Socialists said the prime minister's decision on the pension reform was a \"victory\".\"The French were waiting for your statement and we were waiting for a sign that you'd heard them... The suspension of the pension reform: here it is at last.\"The support of the centrist bloc and the Socialists should give Lecornu enough votes to pass his budget in parliament – but the numbers remain extremely tight, and any breaking of the ranks could result in him being toppled.Le Pen and Mélenchon believe elections are the only way of ending the political deadlock that came out of snap elections called by Macron in the summer of 2024.That deadlock turned to turmoil last week when Lecornu resigned as prime minister 26 days after Macron had appointed him, and only hours after he had named his government.In a week of political twists and drama, Macron then reappointed him late on Friday.The move was widely seen as a last-ditch attempt by the president to exercise control over an increasingly rudderless National Assembly, which has been splintered into three distinct factions since the 2024 vote.That hung parliament has resulted in two short-lived prime ministers who were voted down within months when they attempted to put forward their yearly budgets.Eight days ago, Lecornu stood down before he could even face MPs.",

    "body": "9 hours agoLauren Turner andOsmond ChiaReutersThe US government has seized more than $14bn (£10.5bn) in bitcoin and charged the founder of a Cambodian business empire, the Prince Group, with allegedly masterminding a massive cryptocurrency scam, which involved forced labour camps.UK and Cambodian national Chen Zhi was charged on Tuesday in New York for allegedly engaging in a wire-fraud conspiracy and money laundering scheme.Mr Chen's businesses were also sanctioned by the US and the UK as part of a joint operation. The UK government says it has frozen assets owned by his network, including 19 properties in London - one of which is worth nearly £100m ($133m).The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.US prosecutors said it was one the biggest financial takedowns in history and the largest ever seizure of bitcoin, with approximately 127,271 bitcoin being held by US government.Mr Chen, who remains at large, is accused of being the mastermind behind a \"sprawling cyber-fraud empire\" operating under his multi-national company, the Prince Group, said the US Department of Justice (DOJ).The Cambodia-based group's website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. But the DOJ alleges that it runs one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisations.Unwitting victims were contacted online and convinced to transfer cryptocurrency based on false promises that the funds would be invested and generate profits, the DOJ said.Prosecutors alleged that the company, under Mr Chen's direction, built and operated at least ten scam compounds throughout Cambodia, according to court documents seen by the BBC.Mr Chen was accused of managing the compounds that were specially designed to reach as many victims as possible, said prosecutors.His accomplices allegedly procured millions of mobile phone numbers and set up \"phone farms\" to conduct call centre scams, according to the court documents, dated 8 October.Two of these facilities had 1,250 mobile phones that controlled around 76,000 social media accounts for scams, the documents said.Prosecutors said Prince Group documents included tips on building rapport with victims, advising workers not to use profile photos of women who were \"too beautiful\" so that the accounts would look more genuine.US District Court EDNYCourt documents contained images of \"phone farms\" allegedly used to conduct  scamsAssistant Attorney General for National Security John A Eisenberg described the Prince Group as a \"criminal enterprise built on human suffering\".It also trafficked workers, who were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out scams online, targeting thousands of victims worldwide, he said.Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly used the criminal proceeds for luxury travel and entertainment, said the DOJ. They also made \"extravagant\" purchases like watches, private jets and rare artwork, including a Picasso painting purchased from a New York City auction house, the department said.If convicted, Mr Chen faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in jail.In Britain, Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly incorporated businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in UK property. His network's assets include a £100m office building on central London, a £12m mansion in North London and seventeen flats in the city, said the UK foreign office on Tuesday.Being sanctioned, as part of a joint operation with US authorities, means he is now locked out of the UK's financial system.The Prince Group has also been sanctioned in the US and labelled as a criminal organisation.They were \"ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money\", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.Cooper said: \"Together with our US allies, we are taking decisive action to combat the growing transnational threat posed by this network - upholding human rights, protecting British nationals and keeping dirty money off our streets.\"The foreign office said Mr Chen and the Prince Group built casinos and compounds used as scam centres and laundered the proceeds.Four businesses linked to the alleged scams - The Prince Group, Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World and Byex Exchange -  have also been sanctioned, said the foreign office.Two scam centres allegedly run by Jin Bei Group and Golden Fortune Resorts were named earlier this year in an Amnesty International report on the use of forced labour and torture in Cambodian scam centres.People working in scam centres are often foreign nationals lured by the promise of a legitimate job, and then forced to carry out scams under threat of torture, the foreign office said.These scammers operate on an \"industrial scale\", including in the UK, using tricks like fake romantic relationships to lure victims into being scammed, said the foreign office.Fraud Minister Lord Hanson said: \"Fraudsters prey on the most vulnerable by stealing life savings, ruining trust, and devastating lives. We will not tolerate this.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway legislative elections this month in the South American nation.Welcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not \"waste our time\" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail.Milei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to \"prosperity\".Argentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda.As Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud.\"The election is coming up very soon,\" he said. \"It's a very big election.\"Trump added: \"Victory [for Milei] is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good. I think they will be better after this.\"And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election.\"A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027. But Trump said if \"a socialist wins\" then the US would feel \"a lot differently\" about supporting the South American nation.\"If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,\" Trump said.For his part, Milei blamed Argentina's economic woes on his political adversaries.\"This liquidity problem that Argentina has is a result of the political attacks we have suffered from our opponents,\" he told Trump.How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over TrumpTrump is bailing out Argentina. What happened to 'America first'?Trump's backing for his libertarian ally, who took office in December 2023, is no secret.He said the bailout was \"just helping a great philosophy take over a great country\", and the White House has framed it as supporting an important regional ally.But Trump's explicit linking of a recently announced $20bn currency swap between the US and Argentina to Milei's electoral prospects is notable for an American president who has previously railed against foreign interference in elections.In recent provincial elections in Buenos Aires, Milei's La Libertad Avanza coalition (Freedom Advances) performed worse than expected, spooking markets as they watch for any sign his economic programme's days might be numbered.His party has recently been rocked by several corruption scandals.If Milei's party loses seats, or fails to gain more, in this month's midterms – that could affect his government's ability to pass further reforms.Several key vetoes he has tried to make have already been overturned by Congress, where he doesn't have a majority.But will US support actually make a difference?Argentine stocks fell after Tuesday's news conference.This intervention, which was supposed to stabilise the economy in Argentina, now seemed to hinge on Milei securing more political support.And it seems the financial markets are unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will be enough to boost Milei's electoral chances.This currency swap was, economically speaking, supposed to be a bit of a lifeline for Argentina's currency – the peso, which has been losing value for years.As a means to control inflation, Milei had been stopping the peso from devaluing too drastically by keeping it propped up with the country's reserves.The problem with that is that it drained reserves ahead of $20bn of debt due next year.That led to fears, including among investors, that the country was heading for a financial crisis if it defaulted on its debts again.Some thought that to avert this Milei might have to let the currency devalue drastically – which would lead to a spike in prices as people's money would suddenly be worth less.Many economists told me they thought this would be \"political suicide\". So, perhaps the US intervention helps avoid that political disaster.But is this really going to cut through to ordinary voters? Opinion polls suggest that some Argentines are tiring of Milei's sharp austerity measures.His supporters hail them for bringing down inflation and cutting the deficit.But they've come at a social cost – with large cuts to pensions, education, health, infrastructure, and transport and utilities subsidies among other things.",

    "body": "13 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, DelhiMuskan SharmaMuskan Sharma has dedicated her crown to her motherMuskan Sharma stood up to men who tried to bully her over her clothes - and went on to win hearts and a beauty pageant.The 23-year-old, who was crowned Miss Rishikesh 2025 last week in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, told the BBC that even though it was a small local pageant, \"it made me feel like Miss Universe\".Sharma's win has made headlines in India as it came after a viral video that showed her spiritedly arguing with a man who barged into their rehearsals just a day before the 4 October contest.Sharma, who \"wanted to be a model and participate in a pageant since I was in school\", said the intruders came in just as they broke for lunch. \"We were sitting around, chilling, having a laugh when they walked in,\" she said.The footage showed Raghavendra Bhatnagar, district head of a Hindu group called Rashtriya Hindu Shakti Sangathan, objecting to skirts and western dresses Sharma and other contestants were wearing.\"Modelling is over, go back home,\" Bhatnagar is heard telling them. \"This is against Uttarakhand's culture.\" Sharma refuses to back down. \"Why don't you shut the shops which sell them [Western clothes]?\"She then tells him that he should expend his energies on things that are worse than women's clothing - social evils such as drinking and smoking.\"There's a shop right outside that sells cigarettes and alcohol. Why don't you shut that down? First stop those things and I will stop wearing these clothes,\" she says.The man snaps at her saying \"don't tell me what to do\". Likewise, she retorts. \"If you have the right to choose, then so do we. Our opinion matters as much as yours,\" she says.As the argument continues, Sharma is joined by some of the other contestants and organisers and Bhatnagar and his group, who threatened to stop the show, are finally escorted out by the hotel manager.Muskan SharmaThe Miss Rishikesh contestants were heckled by men for their clothes during rehearsalsSharma says her reaction to Bhatnagar was \"spontaneous\". \"I could see my dreams shattering in front of me. The only question in my mind at the time was will the pageant go on? Will I be able to walk the ramp? Or will all my hard work go waste?\" she says. The next day, the event went on as planned and Sharma won the crown.\"For three seconds after I heard my name announced, I was shocked,\" she said.\"But then I was happy that I stood up for myself and that I won. It felt like a double victory. It was a small pageant in a small place but it made me feel like Miss Universe,\" she said.Sharma says heckling of women for their clothing is unheard of in Rishikesh, a city in the Himalayan foothills on the banks of Ganges river. It's known for its ashrams and meditation and yoga retreats and is considered a holy Hindu site that draws in large numbers of tourists and pilgrims.The city is also sought out by fans of Beatles because the Fab Four had spent weeks at an ashram there in 1968.\"You see tourists dressed in western clothing here all the time and no-one bats an eyelid,\" she adds.Globally, beauty pageants have been criticised for objectifying women and reinforcing gender stereotypes. But these contests have been hugely popular in India since 1994 - the year when Sushmita Sen won the Miss Universe crown and Aishwarya Rai brought home the Miss World trophy. Both went on to become top Bollywood actresses and have inspired generations of young women since then to follow in their path. Similar successes in later years of Priyanka Chopra, Diana Hayden and Lara Dutta have only reinforced the belief that beauty pageants can be a ticket to success, especially for young women in small-town India.Sharma says her parents have always been very supportive of her decision to participate in the pageant. In the viral video, she's even heard asking Bhatnagar: \"Who are you to comment on my clothing if my parents allow me to to wear them?\"Muskan SharmaThe pageant took place as plannedBut the backlash to Western clothing in India is not new where what women wear routinely becomes a subject of debates. In a deeply patriarchal society, many link western clothing, especially jeans, to the \"moral degradation\" of young people. Schools and colleges set dress codes for female students and sometimes village elders bar an entire community of girls from wearing jeans.The BBC has reported a number of cases where girls and women have been singled out and humiliated for their clothes.A few years ago, we wrote about a 19-year-old student in Assam who turned up in shorts to take an exam and was forced to wrap a curtain around her legs after the teacher objected. In one extreme case, a teenager was allegedly murdered by her relatives for wearing jeans. Namita Bhandare in her column in The Hindustan Times newspaper points out that there is no objection to the Mr Rishikesh contest where participants are barely dressed.The objection to Sharma and other contestants' clothing, she writes, is \"barely a fig-leaf\". \"The issue is not clothes. The issue is freedom and aspiration. How dare these young women be on a stage that could springboard them to a larger global platform? How dare they cross lines of honour and shame that a patriarchal society has imposed on them?\"Bhandare writes that in India where there are not enough women MPs or judges, the pushback by young women from a small town is remarkable.Sharma says it's her mother who taught her to stand up for what's right. \"The crown is as much my mother's as it's mine. Without her I wouldn't be the person I am today.\"Her story, she believes, will now encourage other women to stand up for themselves, for what is right. \"I'm saying that in the moment, I was scared and nervous too. But I also want to say that if you believe that you're right, then you can also fight.\"\"For me,\" she says, \"the crown was always secondary. The more important thing was to encourage women to stand up against injustice, to speak up for what's right,\"I ask her what's the next step for her.\"I will go for Miss Uttarakhand next year and then Miss India. After that, I'll see where life takes me.\"",

    "body": "Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has died at the age of 80, family sources have told the BBC.Odinga died on Wednesday while receiving medical treatment at a hospital in India. He collapsed during a morning walk and was taken to Devamatha Hospital, which said he had suffered a cardiac arrest. It said he did not respond to resuscitation measures and was \"declared dead at 09:52\" local time (04:22 GMT).In recent weeks, there has been speculation about his health, although family members and political allies had dismissed reports suggesting he was critically ill. President William Ruto paid tribute to Odinga as a \"beacon of courage\" and \"father of our democracy\". \"Raila Amolo Odinga is truly a once-in-a-generation leader. A man whose ideals transcended politics, and whose legacy will shape the destiny of Kenya for generations to come,\" Ruto said in a live address to the nation.A seven-day period of mourning has also been declared. Odinga will be also be accorded a state funeral with full honours, Ruto said.Raila Odinga: A founding father of Kenya's multi-party democracyHow Odinga's court challenges have improved Kenya's electionsOther Kenyan politicians and world leaders have been sending their condolences, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who described Odinga as a \"towering statesman and a cherished friend of India\".South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said he was a \"leader who placed the interests of his country and continent first\" while Zambia's Hakainde Hichilema described Odinga as \"a towering advocate for democracy\", whose legacy would endure.  The Kenyan president had earlier visited Odinga's family home in Nairobi and expressed his condolences to his widow Ida Odinga and other family members.A delegation led by Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi and Odinga's widow is expected to travel to India to oversee the arrangements to repatriate his body.Odinga's supporters have been pouring onto the streets to mourn, especially in his political strongholds of western Kenya and parts of Nairobi.A political mobiliser and towering figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times. He rejected the results on each occasion, often saying that victory had been stolen from him.He was vindicated by Kenya's highest court after the 2017 elections, when it annulled Uhuru Kenyatta's victory and ordered fresh polls. However, he boycotted the rerun, demanding electoral reforms.Odinga later made up with Kenyatta, stunning the nation when the two shook hands in 2018 – ending months of tension. The disputed election of 2007, in which Odinga claimed he was cheated of victory by Mwai Kibaki, led to the biggest crisis in Kenya's history.Violence erupted around the country, resulting in 1,200 deaths and about 600,000  people were forced to flee their homes.To resolve the crisis, a power-sharing agreement was brokered by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, leading to the formation of a unity government in which Odinga became prime minister.He has often reconciled with the incumbent president after contentious elections.After his most recent defeat in 2022, he later joined President Ruto in a so-called broad-based government, which brought several of his allies into key positions.He defended the move as necessary for national unity, coming in the aftermath of watershed nationwide protests last year that culminated in the storming of parliament. Dozens of protesters were killed in confrontations with security officers.The Ruto administration backed Odinga's bid to become chairperson of the African Union Commission, in elections held earlier this year. Despite strong regional support, he lost to Djibouti's Mahmoud Ali Youssouf.Odinga inspired a passionate and loyal following throughout his political career, especially in western Kenya, where he was born.His supporters called him \"Baba\" (Father), \"Agwambo\" (Act of God), and \"Tinga\" (Tractor) - drawn from his party's symbol during the 1997 elections.He was widely regarded as a master strategist and mass mobiliser, often drawing huge crowds to his political rallies, and he had a deep ability to connect with ordinary people.He will be remembered for his unwavering fight for democratic freedoms and human rights.He was a former political prisoner, and holds the record for being Kenya's longest-serving detainee. His struggle against one-party dictatorship saw him detained twice (from 1982 to 1988 and 1989 to 1991) during the rule of Daniel arap Moi.He was initially imprisoned for trying to stage a coup in 1982, which propelled him on to the national stage.For most of his political life, Odinga has been seen as symbol of resistance and political reform and his death leaves a vacuum about who can fill his shoes and carry on his legacy.He is the son of Jaramogi Odinga, Kenya's first vice-president, who walked out of government after falling out with then-leader Jomo Kenyatta, Uhuru Kenyatta's father.",

    "body": "17 hours agoSammy AwamiBBC Africa, Antananarivo andDanai Nesta KupembaMadagascar crowds cheer as military unit seizes powerAn elite military unit says it has seized power in Madagascar from President Andry Rajoelina following weeks of youth-led protests in the Indian Ocean island.Standing outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, CAPSAT chief Col Michael Randrianirina said the military would form a government and hold elections within two years. He also suspended key democratic institutions, like the electoral commission.Gen Z protesters will be part of the changes because \"the movement was created in the streets so we have to respect their demands\", he added.Troops and protesters have been celebrating the apparent ousting of President Rajoelina, with thousands waving flags in the capital, Antananarivo.CAPSAT, or the Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar.The unit supported Rajoelina when he came into power in 2009,  but joined the protesters on Saturday. Madagascar's constitutional court has named Col Randrianirina as the country's new leader, even though a statement from the president's office said he was still in charge and denounced what it described as an \"attempted coup d'etat\".'We have seized power,' says head of military unitAFP via Getty ImagesYouth-led protests began over electricity cuts and water shortagesThe demonstrations soon escalated, to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, rampant corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.Protesters clashed with security forces resulting in the death of at least 22 people and more than 100 others injured, according to the UN, although the Malagasy government has dismissed those figures and described them as based on \"rumours and misinformation\".President Rajoelina, an entrepreneur and former DJ, was once seen as a fresh start for Madagascar. The baby-faced leader became president when he was just 34, earning the title of Africa's youngest leader, and going on to govern for four years, before returning to power after the 2018 election.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Andry Rajoelina gave a speech on Monday via his Facebook page But he fell out of favour following allegations of cronyism and corruption, which he denied. Despite the fact that power appears to have shifted away from him, he has continued to try to influence events. Rajoelina attempted to dissolve the national assembly before the opposition could vote to strip him of his presidency for abandonment of post, but that did not work.Lawmakers voted to impeach Rajoelina by 130 votes to one blank ballot on Tuesday. Even members of his party, Irmar, voted overwhelmingly to impeach him.Rajoelina rejected the vote, calling it \"null and void\". The African Union (AU) has warned against soldiers \"meddling\" in Madagascar's political affairs and rejected \"any attempt at unconstitutional changes of government\".French President Emmanuel Macron called the situation \"greatly worrying\".The island has gone through a series of political upheavals in recent years.Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of its 30 million people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.

    "body": "1 hour agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent andLiv McMahonBBC Technology JournalistReutersOpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to \"treat adult users like adults\",  says its boss Sam Altman.In a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way  - \"but only if you want it, not because we are usage maxxing\".The move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's xAI's recent introduction of two sexually explicit chatbots to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers.It is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions.OpenAI did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.Mr Altman said OpenAI had previously made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\".These changes were announced in a blog post in August, which no longer appears on OpenAI's website.\"We realise this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,\" Mr Altman posted on Tuesday.He said ChatGPT could soon relax the restrictions \"now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools\".He added: \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.\" The changes come after OpenAI was sued earlier this year by parents of a US teen who took his own life.The lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.The family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts.In a statement given at the time, OpenAI told the BBC it was reviewing the filing.\"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time,\" the company said.Child safety concernsWritten erotica does not require age verification in the UK under the Online Safety Act. However, pornographic images, including those generated by AI, would require users to prove they are over 18.In the US, critics say OpenAI's decision to allow erotica on the platform shows the need for more regulation at the federal and state levels.\"How are they going to make sure that children are not able to access the portions of ChatGPT that are adult-only and provide erotica?\" said Jenny Kim, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. Ms Kim is involved in a lawsuit against Meta that claims the company's Instagram's algorithm harms the mental health of teen users.\"OpenAI, like most of big tech in this space, is just using people like guinea pigs,\" she said. In April, TechCrunch reported that OpenAI was allowing accounts in which a user had registered as a minor to generate graphic erotica.OpenAI said at the time that the company was rolling out a fix to limit such content.A survey published this month by the nonprofit Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) found that one in five students report that they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with AI.On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature that would have blocked developers from offering AI chatbots companions to children unless the companies could guarantee the software wouldn't breed harmful behaviour.Newsom said it was \"imperative that adolescents learn how to safely interact with AI systems\" in a message that accompanied his veto.At the nationwide level, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots interact with children.In the US Senate last month, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would chatbot users to file liability claims against their developers.Why introduce erotica?Mr Altman's announcement on Tuesday comes as sceptics have been questioning the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies.OpenAI's revenue is growing, but it has never been profitable.Tulane University business professor Rob Lalka, author of The Venture Alchemists, said the major AI companies find themselves in a battle for market share.\"No company has ever had the kind of adoption that OpenAI saw with ChatGPT,\" Prof Lalka told BBC News. \"They needed to continue to push along that exponential growth curve, achieving market domination as much as they can,\" he added.",

    "body": "Burkina Faso's military government has refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries. Donald Trump's administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of his crackdown on immigration.  The US State Department said it was committed to ending illegal and mass migration and bolstering US border security. The Department of Homeland Security have been contacted for comment.Burkina Faso's leader Capt Ibrahim Traoré styles himself as a pan-African champion, standing up to Western imperialism. His military government seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent?Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks outAppearing on state broadcaster RTB late on Thursday, the foreign minister asked: \"Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is... Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion.\" He said he had a meeting with the US Embassy on Wednesday in which he rejected the offer - that he said had been made repeatedly - to accept deportees.On Thursday, the US embassy in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou announced on its website that it would temporarily pause issuing immigrant, tourist, student and business traveller visas. Instead, residents of Burkina Faso will have to travel to the US embassy in the capital of neighbouring Togo. Foreign Minister Traoré said he had received a diplomatic note from the US explaining that Burkina Faso was put on a list of countries whose nationals had not respected rules around US visas and referring to the US proposals, according to a local news outlet's transcript of the interview. Several African countries - Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda and South Sudan - have all accepted people from third countries expelled from the US in recent months. On Monday, Eswatini accepted 10 deportees despite legal challenges, adding to an earlier group of five, which the US had described as serious criminals. However, Nigeria has said it would not take any US deportees.Trump's crackdown aims to deport millions of immigrants in the US illegally. \"Naturally, this proposal, which we considered indecent at the time, runs completely contrary to the principle of dignity,\" Traoré added.

    "body": "9 hours agoAnahita SachdevBBC News, DelhiSaffronartVS Gaitonde's Untitled fetched $40.2m at a recent record-breaking auction in DelhiA radiant golden canvas layered with subtle textures and faint shapes, exuding both energy and tranquillity.This untitled 1971 painting by Vasudeo Santu Gaitonde headlined a record-breaking recent Saffronart auction in Delhi, which fetched $40.2m (£29.9m) - the highest-ever total for South Asian art. Gaitonde's work alone sold for $7.57m, nearly three times its estimate, making it India's second most expensive painting.The bidding added momentum to an already strong auction season for Indian art. Just days later, Sotheby's sold artist Francis Newton Souza's landscape, Houses in Hampstead, at a price marginally lower than Gaitonde's piece, making it India's third highest grossing painting. Earlier this year, the record for India's most expensive painting was reset when MF Husain's Untitled (Gram Yatra) fetched a staggering $13.8m.Auctioneers and curators say India's art market is witnessing an unprecedented boom, driven by a surge of art fairs, galleries, and exhibition spaces across cities and towns.Industry insiders estimate that the market is worth $338m, up exponentially from $2m at the turn of the century, and will expand to $1.1bn by 2030.Sotheby'sFrancis Newton Souza's Houses in Hampstead has become India's third most expensive paintingDinesh Vazirani, a founder of Saffronart, believes this is a \"point of massive inflection\".Marking its 25th anniversary, Saffronart's recent auction saw a packed room, spirited bidding, and a rare \"white glove\" result - every lot sold, with some attendees even \"squabbling\" over artworks, according to an attendee.\"When we started in 2000, people said we were crazy. Who's going to buy art online?\" Mr Vazirani said.\"Seeing the art market with so much strength almost validated that what we started as maybe foolish young people has become a very mature industry.\"The boom in Indian art - which dominates South Asia's market - comes even as global art sales slump. The 2024 Art Basel and UBS report shows a 12% drop worldwide, the second yearly decline.Mr Vazirani predicts the auction market could double last year's earnings, driven by rising wealth in India and among the diaspora. Millionaire households have nearly doubled in four years. As the rich pour money into their luxurious lifestyle, art has become both a status symbol and an investment. For these groups, art is a generational asset that can also be enjoyed, Mr Vazirani argues.\"They understand that you can't buy it and trade in it. But if you hold it for long periods of time, the appreciation is quite dramatic.\"Recent tax cuts slashing goods and services tax (GST) on art from 12% to 5% have also helped boost the market.While global buyers dominate, much of the demand abroad comes from diaspora collectors seeking \"a slice of their heritage\", said Manjari Sihare-Sutin, co-head of Sotheby's Indian and South Asian Art department. Its recent auction, which sold the Souza painting, was another \"white glove\" sale, earning $25.5m - the department's highest total in 30 years.\"I think art has become an important conduit for both local collectors and Indian diaspora outside of India to reconnect with their roots,\" Ms Sihare-Sutin said.GettyThe Kochi-Muziris Biennale in the southern state of Kerala is popular for its exhibits These trends have attracted new buyers: a third of Sotheby's last-month bidders were first-timers with them, while Saffronart reports 25–30% of its buyers are recent entrants.While top sales often feature established modernists like Husain, Souza, Gaitonde, and Raza, auctioneers say rising top prices lift demand and values for previously overlooked artists as well.Unlike the brief speculative boom of the early 2000s, which collapsed in 2008, insiders say the current surge in the Indian art market feels more sustainable, going beyond galleries and auctions.Curator Ina Puri notes a resurgence in India's art scene, driven by growing recognition of Indian artists and increased investment in spaces for public engagement.\"I feel that Indian art has made a comeback,\" Ms Puri said.\"Across the country, there are new institutions, museums and spaces coming up to showcase art.\" Government funding for the arts has long lagged behind other priorities, leaving the private sector to lead. A notable example is Kiran Nadar Museum of Art's new Delhi building, set to open in 2026, spanning 100,000 sq m and showcasing both visual and performance art.Other examples: Hampi Art Labs in Karnataka offers exhibitions and artist residencies; Art Mumbai fair's third edition in November expects 40,000 visitors; and Renault's planned Chennai design centre will merge technology with artistic collaboration.These join established events like the India Art Fair in Delhi and Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala, which draw record crowds annually.Galleries are increasingly showcasing indigenous and marginalised art, Ms Puri said, though more support is needed for students and emerging artists. AFP via Getty ImagesThe India Art Fair in Delhi is a popular event that receives thousands of visitors annuallyDelhi-based non-profit Khoj, founded in 1997, tries to fill this gap by supporting emerging artists through programs and residencies. Director Pooja Sood notes growing participation from smaller towns often overlooked by the art world.\"They're trying to build their own thing,\" she said. \"It's fantastic\".Rising interest in South Asian art boosts the ecosystem, but record-breaking sales of established artists don't directly aid newcomers - ground-up support remains essential.Ms Sood stresses that Khoj operates outside the commercial art world, offering young and mid-career artists a space to explore, experiment, and \"even fail if they have to\".\"I feel the more mad, crazy, experimental art happens in very small pockets, and that's what we're always trying to build.\""

    "body": "Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters?10 hours agoPaul Njie BBC Africa, YaoundéAFP/Getty ImagesThe world's oldest head of state - 92-year-old Paul Biya - has promised Cameroon's electorate \"the best is still to come\" as he seeks his eighth consecutive presidential term on Sunday.The nonagenarian has already been in power since 1982 - another seven-year mandate could see him rule for 50 years until he will be almost 100.He defied widespread calls to step down and has been criticised for only showing up for one rally, spending most of the campaign period on a 10-day private trip to Europe.A backlash over his reliance on an AI-generated campaign video, as his opponents actively wooed voters on the ground, saw him rush north on his return home.In the vote-rich city of Maroua on Tuesday he addressed crowds of his party supporters - reaching out in particular to women and young people, promising to prioritise their plight in his next mandate.\"I will keep my word,\" he insisted, urging them to \"give me your valuable support once again\".But political analyst Immanuel Wanah tells the BBC that Biya's primary focus since coming to power has been to stay in power, \"often at the expense of efforts to enhance the living conditions of the country's citizens\".It is a view echoed by Dr Tilarius Atia, another political analyst, who puts this survivalist mindset down to an abortive coup against Biya in 1984.It means that for the vast majority of the population, Biya is the only president they have known - more than 60% of Cameroon's 30 million people are below the age of 25.Young political activist Marie Flore Mboussi is desperate for \"new blood\" as she believes \"longevity in power inevitably leads to a kind of laziness\".\"After 43 years, the people are tired,\" she tells the BBC.The presidential election comes amid growing concerns about inflation, security challenges, poor social services, corruption and unemployment.Youth unemployment has been a particular talking point for most of the candidates running in the election.Nearly 40% of young Cameroonians between the ages of 15 and 35 are unemployed, with 23% of young graduates facing challenges in obtaining formal employment, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\"Young people are more inclined to emigrate abroad because they tell themselves that inside the country, they do not have the possibility of becoming somebody,\" 26-old-year graduate Vanina Nzekui tells the BBC.\"They tell themselves that all positions are occupied by older people,\" she says, adding that this comes at the cost of using their skills to help develop the country.But Aziseh Mbi, 23, believes age should not be a criterion for leadership.In Biya's case, the civil society activist says, the president has been able to do \"significant things,\" citing several youth initiatives.ReutersPresident Biya was keen to appeal to women and young people during his only election rallyBeyond youth unemployment, the electoral process has also stirred controversy, especially with the exclusion of Maurice Kamto from the presidential race.In July the electoral body barred the 71-year-old opposition leader from running because a rival faction of the party that had endorsed him presented someone else as a candidate.His exclusion, confirmed by the Constitutional Council, was widely criticised as a ploy to prevent any strong challenge to President Biya.After coming second in the 2018 presidential election, Kamto claimed victory and organised street protests.\"The exclusion of Prof Kamto waters down the legitimacy of our democracy because we should have been fair enough to allow for everybody to partake,\" says Dr Atia.Mr Wanah agrees that the absence of the country's main opposition figure \"reinforces the perception that truly fair elections cannot take place in Cameroon\".Twelve candidates were approved to contest for the country's top job, including Issa Tchiroma Bakary and Bello Bouba Maigari - both former Biya allies from the north of the country. They resigned from their ministerial positions in government to take on their boss.Lawmaker Cabral Libii, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) party Joshua Osih and Patricia Tomaïno Ndam Njoya - the lone female candidate - are also in the race.At the launch of the election campaign, two aspirants, including renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna, withdrew their candidacies to support Maigari of the NUDP party. This means 10 people will now compete for the presidency.Michel Mvondo / BBCTwo candidates have withdrawn from the race and thrown their weight behind Bello Bouba Maigari, once a Biya ally Prior to the poll - which will only be a single-round vote as the person with the most votes will win - there had been widespread calls for the opposition to present a single candidate to challenge Biya, who has never lost an election.Tchiroma Bakary has secured the support of the Union for Change, a coalition of more than 50 political groups and civil society organisations who presented him as the opposition's consensus candidate.But the initiative has failed to gain unanimity, with others refusing to rally behind him.Kamto said he had held talks with some aspirants, including the two northern figures Tchiroma Bakary and Maigari, encouraging them to unite. As neither seemed ready to step down, he urged Cameroonians to vote for whomever they preferred.Dr Atia reckons the failure to endorse one candidate under a single coalition will cost the opposition at the ballot box.On the campaign trail, 76-year-old Tchiroma Bakary, a former government spokesperson, has been pulling big crowds - with some analysts positioning  the Cameroon National Salvation Front party leader as Biya's main challenger.On Sunday, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to see him in the economic capital Douala.He has promised to reform the system of which he was a part for two decades.Despite Tchiroma Bakary's support base in the north, analysts say Biya is likely to overpower him and the other opposition candidates.\"President Biya just needs a slim majority to win the election, and I see him winning despite the efforts being made by the opposition,\" says Dr Atia.Michel Mvondo / BBCFormer government spokesperson Issa Tchiroma Bakary has promised reform and is drawing big crowdsIn Cameroon's English-speaking North-West and South-West regions, where a long-running separatist conflict continues, an election boycott lockdown has been imposed, paralysing business activities, movement and education.The separatists who have imposed it have threatened to target anyone who does vote.\"We have seen people [who] have been pulled out of their homes and slaughtered in cold blood, before, during, and even well after [previous] elections when they are identified,\" Samah Abang-Mugwa, a resident of one of the Anglophone regions, tells the BBC - adding that he will not risk casting his ballot.Since 2017, those seeking to create a breakaway state have been fighting government forces. They are angered by what they see as the marginalisation of Cameroon's minority Anglophone community by the Francophone-dominated government.The conflict has so far killed at least 6,000 people and forced nearly half a million others from their homes, according to the UN.According to civil society activist Abine Ayah, the likely exclusion of much of the English-speaking community could undermine the legitimacy of the election.Although Biya says his government has made significant efforts to resolve the conflict, his opponents in the presidential race continue to criticise his handling of the situation.After Sunday's vote, the Constitutional Council has 15 days to announce the results.The interior minister has already warned that no candidate is allowed to declare victory beforehand.Paul Atanga Nji made the comments on the eve of the last day of campaigning.\"Those who will attempt to announce results of the presidential election or any self-proclaimed victory in violation of the laws of the republic would have crossed the red line and should be ready to face the retaliatory measures commensurate to their crime.\"Additional reporting by the BBC's Michel Mvondo in Yaoundé.More from the BBC on Cameroon's election:Is the world's oldest leader set for an eighth term?Social media revamp by 92-year-old presidentThe African president who keeps defying death rumoursWhy African leaders maintain secrecy around their healthGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts"

    "body": "'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley10 hours agoLily JamaliTechnology correspondent, San FranciscoGetty ImagesSilicon Valley is home to many major tech firms, including Apple's circular headquartersAt OpenAI's DevDay this week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman did what American tech bosses rarely do these days: he actually answered questions from reporters.\"I know it's tempting to write the bubble story,\" Mr Altman told me as he sat flanked by his top lieutenants. \"In fact, there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.\"In Silicon Valley, the debate over whether AI companies are overvalued has taken on a new urgency. Sceptics are privately - and some now publicly - asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\".In other words - there are fears these companies are overvalued.Mr Altman said he expected investors would make some bad calls and silly start-ups would walk away with crazy money.But with OpenAI, he told me, \"there's something real happening here\".Not everyone is convinced.In recent days, warnings of an AI bubble have come from the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, as well as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who told the BBC \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".And here, in what is often considered the tech capital of the world, concerns are growing.At a panel discussion at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum this week, early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan told a packed audience he has lived through four bubbles.Getty ImagesJerry Kaplan founded Go Corporation, which developed early tablet computersHe's especially concerned now given the magnitude of money on the table as compared to the dot-com boom. There's so much more to lose.\"When [the bubble] breaks, it's going to be really bad, and not just for people in AI,\" he said. \"It's going to drag down the rest of the economy.\"However, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has minted its fair share of tech entrepreneurs, Prof Anat Admati says while there have been many attempts to model when we're in the bubble, it can be a futile exercise.\"It is very hard to time a bubble,\" Prof Admati told me. \"And you can't say with certainty you were in one until after the bubble has burst.\"But the data is concerning to many.AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year - and Gartner estimates global spending on AI will likely reach a whopping $1.5tn (£1.1tn) before 2025 is out.OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, is at the centre of the tangled web of deals drawing scrutiny.For example - last month, it entered into a $100bn deal with chipmaker Nvidia, which is itself the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.It expands an existing investment Nvidia already had in Mr Altman's company - with  expectations that OpenAI will build data centres powered with Nvidia's advanced chips.Then on Monday, OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of equipment for developing AI from Nvidia rival AMD, in a deal that could make it one of AMD's largest shareholders.Remember this is a private company, albeit one recently valued at a half-trillion dollars.Then there's tech giant Microsoft, which is heavily invested, and cloud computing behemoth Oracle has a $300bn deal with OpenAI, too.OpenAI's Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, funded with the help of Oracle and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and announced at the White House during President Donald Trump's first week in office, grows ever larger every few months. And as for Nvidia, it has a stake in AI startup CoreWeave - which supplies OpenAI with some of its massive infrastructure needs.Getty ImagesOpenAI boss Sam Altman And as these increasingly complex financing arrangements get more and more common, the experts here in Silicon Valley say they may be clouding perceptions on AI demand.Some people aren't mincing their words about it either, calling the deals \"circular financing\" or even \"vendor financing\" - where a company invests in or lends to its own customers so they can continue making purchases.\"Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented,\" Mr Altman told me on Monday. But, he added, \"it's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast.\"OpenAI's revenue is growing quickly, but it has never turned a profit.And it is hardly a good sign that the people I've spoken to keep bringing up Nortel - the Canadian telecom equipment-maker that borrowed prolifically to help finance deals for their customers (and thereby artificially boost demand for their wares). For his part, Nvidia's Jensen Huang defended his deal with OpenAI on CNBC Monday, saying the firm isn't required to buy his company's tech with the money he invests.\"They can use it to do anything they like,\" Huang said. \"There's no exclusivities. Our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow – and grow the ecosystem.\"Telltale signsMr Kaplan says he sees a couple of telltale signs the AI sector - and therefore the wider economy - could be in trouble.In frothy times, he says, companies announce major initiatives and product plans that they don't yet have the capital for.Meanwhile, retail investors clamour to get in on the start-up action.The surge in AMD stock this week could indicate investors are trying to get a piece of the ChatGPT wealth machine - and while all this is playing out, real physical infrastructure aimed at satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger for more AI development is being built.\"We're creating a new man-made ecological disaster: enormous data centres in remote places like deserts, that will be rusting away and leaching bad things into the environment, with no one left to hold accountable because the builders and investors will be long gone,\" Mr Kaplan said.Getty ImagesOpenAI wants to secure $500bn to build a 10-gigawatt complex, under construction in Texas, by the end of this year.But even if we are in a bubble, the hope from Silicon Valley is investments being made now won't necessary go to waste.\"The thing that comforts me is that the internet was built on the ashes of the over-investment into the telecom infrastructure of yesterday,\" said Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the AI community hub Hugging Face.\"If there is overinvestment into infrastructure for AI workloads, there may be financial risks tied to it,\" he said. \"But it's going to enable lots of great new products and experiences including ones we're not thinking about today.\"There are plenty of believers in AI's potential to transform society.The question is whether the money to fund the ambitions of the foremost companies in the sector may be drying up.\"Nvidia looks like the last lender or investor,\" said Rihard Jarc, who founded the UncoverAlpha newsletter. \"Who else has the capacity right now to invest $100 billion in another company?\""

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPSébastien Lecornu spent just 26 days as prime minister before his dramatic resignation last MondayPresident Emmanuel Macron has asked Sébastien Lecornu to return as French prime minister only four days after he stood down from the post, sparking a week of high drama and political turmoil.Macron made the announcement late on Friday, hours after meeting all the main parties together at the Élysée Palace, except the leaders of the far right and far left. Lecornu's return came as a surprise, as he said on national TV only two days ago he was not \"chasing the job\" and his \"mission is over\". It is not even certain he will be able to form a government, but he will have to hit the ground running. The new prime minister faces a deadline on Monday to put next year's budget before parliament.  The Élysée said the president had \"tasked [Lecornu] with forming a government\" and Macron's entourage indicated he had been given \"carte blanche\" to act.Lecornu, who is 39 and one of Macron's most loyal allies, then released a long statement on X in which he accepted \"out of duty the mission entrusted to me by the president, to do everything to provide France with a budget by the end of the year and respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots\".When he appeared on French TV this week, Lecornu described himself as a \"soldier-monk\", and as he prepared to get to grips with forming a government he said on Friday \"I will do everything to succeed in this mission\".AFP via Getty ImagesNational Rally leader Marine Le Pen (L) was not invited to Macron's talks and went to talk to voters at a livestock show insteadPolitical divisions over how to bring down France's national debt and cut the budget deficit have led to the fall of two of the past three prime ministers in the last year, so his challenge is immense. France's public debt earlier this year was almost 114% of economic output (GDP) - the third highest in the eurozone - and this year's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.Among the conditions Lecornu listed for taking on the job, one was that \"no-one will be able to shirk\" the necessity of restoring France's public finances. With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a \"bad joke\", from a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Élysée\".Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls.Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part.He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments.By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the socle commun (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree.But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support.In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.AFP via Getty ImagesMarine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through. It also falls short of the demands of left-wing leaders as they were hoping Macron would choose a prime minister from their side. Olivier Faure of the Socialists said \"since we've not been given any guarantees, we won't give any guarantee [to back the prime minister] in a vote of confidence\".Fabien Roussel from the Communists said after meeting the president that the left wanted real change, and a prime minister from the president's centrist camp would not be accepted by the French people.Greens leader Marine Tondelier said she was \"stunned\" Macron had offered the left almost nothing, adding that \"all of this is going to turn out very badly\". While Macron and his reappointed prime minister look to slash the government's budget deficit by tens of billions of euros, the head of France's central bank has warned that the political turmoil will set the economy back even further.The bank is forecasting growth this year of 0.7%, but its chief François Villeroy de Galhau says it could have been higher and the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has cost France an estimated 0.2% of extra growth.\"Like many in France I've had enough of this [political] mess,\" he told RTL radio. \"It's time for compromises - that's not a dirty word - even forming coalitions.\"If Lecornu fails to form a government, there could be even more instability, and that will cost the French economy even more."

James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. \"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". \"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. \"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictmentTrump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\"."

    "body": "9 hours agoKayla Epsteinin New York City andLeire VentasBBC News MundoGetty ImagesMonica Moreta Galarza was thrown to the ground when her husband was arrested outside immigration court in New York CityMonica Moreta Galarza felt relieved after her husband's routine immigration hearing at New York City's 26 Federal Plaza.A judge had ordered Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López to return to court in May, and she believed that meant a reprieve from his potential deportation to Ecuador. Instead, as soon as they stepped out of the courtroom with their children, she was torn from her husband's arms and thrown to the ground by immigration officers as they detained him.\"One of them charged at me so aggressively that I was terrified, and he ended up throwing me to the ground,\" Ms Moreta Galarza told BBC News Mundo in Spanish. \"They treated us like animals.\"The incident, which has since gone viral, led to one immigration agent being temporarily suspended. But it is not an isolated occurrence. The BBC witnessed similar incidents at the court house, while others – including an aggressive encounter between Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the media – have sparked public outcry.ICE's operations inside the building have created a charged, tense environment, attorneys said.\"I would honestly sum it up as just traumatic,\" said Allison Cutler, a New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG) attorney who works at 26 Federal Plaza.\"It's traumatic for the clients we're serving, for the families getting ripped apart.\"Getty ImagesFederal immigration officers wearing masks and sunglasses detain a man who appeared for his hearing at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City on 30 JulyWhile many of the detentions at 26 Federal Plaza are swift and non-violent, reporters and lawyers have witnessed several chaotic episodes in recent weeks.On a Tuesday in late August, the BBC watched as a dozen officers waiting outside a courtroom descended on a man, two women and a small boy. They quickly detained the man, and a melee ensued as the group fought to stay together.The crying woman, clinging to the detained man, was wrenched away by a federal officer - who appeared to be the same man who pulled Ms Moreta Galarza from her husband - as the man was carted off.The judge closed the courtroom and, as a result, the BBC could not verify details of the case. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide details of the man's current status, but stated that the agency \"takes its responsibility to protect children seriously\".They added that ICE gives parents the option of being removed with their children or having them placed with a designated individual.After the images of the incident with Ms Moreta Galarza spread on social media, DHS reported that the officer involved in the incident had been disciplined.Then last week, immigration officers were captured on video shoving two journalists to the ground as they tried to document a possible detention. One of the journalists could not get up, and was transported to the hospital.\"Nothing like this has happened with journalists before,\" Olga Fedorova, the other photojournalist thrown to the floor, told the BBC. Ms Fedorova frequently reports from the building and said that before the incident, \"we were able to work with federal agents, around federal agents with no incidents 99% of the time\".DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC in a statement that officers were making an arrest when they were \"swarmed by agitators and members of the press, which obstructed operations\".Ms McLaughlin said that \"officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator\".Chaotic encounters with government officials have played out multiple times in the lower Manhattan building this year, as immigration courts become key sites of a mass deportation initiative ordered by the Trump administration. Half of the 3,320 immigrants ICE has detained in the New York City area between Trump's inauguration and the end of July were arrested at 26 Federal Plaza, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project. The numbers suggest the building's immigration courts and offices are a primary engine of the administration's deportation plans in America's biggest city.About three quarters of people arrested at 26 Federal Plaza since Trump's inauguration did not have past criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the Deportation Data Project numbers suggest.Officers routinely pull multiple detainees from their hearings, without giving them the chance to speak to lawyers.\"We've never seen anything like this,\" said Benjamin Remy, a NYLAG lawyer who spends several days a week working with immigrants at Federal Plaza.Many immigrants no longer show up to court, he said. At one August hearing, a man with a criminal record failed to appear. The judge therefore ordered him removed from the country and threw out his asylum case.His attendance may not have changed the outcome; immigration enforcement was assembled outside that courtroom as well.Non-citizens in the US without a visa or similar documentation have always been subject to removal, said Triciah Claxton, supervising attorney with Safe Passage, an immigration rights group focused on minors.\"There used to be a concentrated effort on those who might have had criminal histories or prior arrests,\" said Ms Claxton, whose clients mostly appear virtually to avoid detention.But now, she said, that net appears to have widened.\"You see a lot of people who are in the process - they have asylum claims pending, they have other forms of relief pending – are still being taken in,\" Ms Claxton said.Getty ImagesPeople wait to enter immigration court as federal agents patrol the hallsLegal experts say this is an abuse of the courts system and puts immigrants into an impossible position. If they turn up for court hearings, as they are instructed to do, they could be arrested. But if they skip their court date, a judge could automatically order their deportation.The government argues it has broad authority to detain people who are in the US illegally.The administration says it is removing dangerous criminals from the country, and the White House and Department of Homeland Security frequently tout the arrests and detentions of undocumented migrants with violent criminal histories.It says it makes arrests in immigration court for safety reasons.\"DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,\" an agency official said in a statement to BBC.A New York Times/Siena poll found that the majority of respondents, 54%, supported deporting people who are here illegally. Over half (51%) felt the government was targeting the right people.In the case of Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López, whose wife Ms Moreta Galarza was pushed to the floor, the government says he was a violent criminal, and that it was justified in arresting him at court.Ortiz López entered the country illegally on 20 March 2024 and was wanted after being arrested on 18 June for \"assault and criminal obstruction of airway or bloodstream\".\"President Trump and Secretary (of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem will not allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,\" the statement added.\"If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return.\"But for Ms Moreta Galarza, the incident at the courthouse reminded her of the injustices she says she fled in her home country of Ecuador.\"I suffered a lot in my country. I had no protection and the authorities there didn't care,\" she tells BBC News Mundo.She adds that she never thought the same thing would happen to her in the US.\"It's very ugly. I feel like I'm worthless now.\""

    "body": "11 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWatch: 'It was shocking', Trump says of China's tightened export rules for rare earthsUS President Donald Trump has said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China from next month. In a post on social media, Trump said the US would also put export controls on critical software. In an earlier post on Friday, he hit back at Beijing's move this week to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".He threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. He later said he had not cancelled it, but that he did not know \"that we're going to have it\". \"I'm going to be there regardless,\" he told reporters at the White House.Financial markets dropped in the wake of Trump's remarks, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.  China dominates production of rare earths and certain other key materials, which are key components in cars, smartphones and many other items.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials. Carmaker Ford even had to temporarily pause production.In addition to tightening rules for rare earth exports, China has opened a monopoly investigation into the US tech firm Qualcomm that could stall its acquisition of another chipmaker. Getty ImagesTrump visited China in his first termAlthough Qualcomm is based in the US, a significant portion of its business is concentrated in China.Beijing has also said it will charge new port fees to ships with ties to the US, including those owned or operated by US firms.\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump wrote in a post on social media on Friday. \"They are becoming very hostile.\"The US and China have been in a fragile trade détente since May, when the two sides agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods that had nearly stopped trade between the two countries. The move left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a new 10% tariff.Officials have held a series of talks since then on matters including TikTok, agricultural purchases, and the trade of rare earths and advanced technology like semiconductors.The two sides were expected to meet again this month at a summit in South Korea.China expert Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Xi's recent actions were a bid to shape the upcoming talks, noting that the recent rare earths directive does not go into effect immediately.\"He's looking for ways to seize the initiative,\" he said. \"The Trump administration is having to play a game of whack-a-mole and deal with these issues as they come up.\"He added that he did not think China was worried about US retaliation in response.\"What China took away from the Liberation Day tariffs and the cycle of escalation followed by de-escalation is that the Chinese side had a higher pain threshold,\" he said. \"From their perspective, the Trump administration blinked.\" In prior rounds of trade talks, China has pushed for looser US restrictions on semiconductors. It is also interested in securing more stable tariff policies that would make it easier for its businesses to sell into the US. Xi had previously used as leverage his country's dominance of rare earths production. But the export rules unveiled this week target overseas defence manufacturers, making them particularly serious, said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Nothing makes America move like targeting our defence industry,\" she said. \"The US is going to have to negotiate because we have limited options, and in an era of rising geopolitical tension and potential conflict, we need to build our industrial defence base.\"While a Trump-Xi meeting now looks unlikely, she said it was not necessarily completely off the table. Ms Baskaran said there's still time and room for talks. China's new rules don't take effect until December. \"Negotiations are likely imminent,\" she said. \"Who does them and where they happen will be determined with time.\""

    "body": "1 day agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCMark Zuckerberg is said to have started work on Koolau Ranch, his sprawling 1,400-acre compound on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, as far back as 2014. It is set to include a shelter, complete with its own energy and food supplies, though the carpenters and electricians working on the site were banned from talking about it by non-disclosure agreements, according to a report by Wired magazine. A six-foot wall blocked the project from view of a nearby road.Asked last year if he was creating a doomsday bunker, the Facebook founder gave a flat \"no\". The underground space spanning some 5,000 square feet is, he explained, \"just like a little shelter, it's like a basement\".That hasn't stopped the speculation - likewise about his decision to buy 11 properties in the Crescent Park neighbourhood of Palo Alto in California, apparently adding a 7,000 square feet underground space beneath. Bloomberg via Getty ImagesZuckerberg spent a reported $110m on properties in a neighbourhood in Palo AltoThough his building permits refer to basements, according to the New York Times, some of his neighbours call it a bunker. Or a billionaire's bat cave.Then there is the speculation around other tech leaders, some of whom appear to have been busy buying up chunks of land with underground spaces, ripe for conversion into multi-million pound luxury bunkers. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has talked about \"apocalypse insurance\". This is something about half of the super-wealthy have, he has previously claimed, with New Zealand a popular destination for homes.So, could they really be preparing for war, the effects of climate change, or some other catastrophic event the rest of us have yet to know about? Getty Images NewsSam Altman once speculated about joining Peter Thiel at a remote property in New Zealand in the event of a global disasterIn the last few years, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has only added to that list of potential existential woes. Many are deeply worried at the sheer speed of the progression. Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist and a co-founder of Open AI, is reported to be one of them.By mid-2023, the San Francisco-based firm had released ChatGPT - the chatbot now used by hundreds of millions of people across the world - and they were working fast on updates.But by that summer, Mr Sutskever was becoming increasingly convinced that computer scientists were on the brink of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) - the point at which machines match human intelligence - according to a book by journalist Karen Hao.In a meeting, Mr Sutskever suggested to colleagues that they should dig an underground shelter for the company's top scientists before such a powerful technology was released on the world, Ms Hao reports.AFP via Getty Images\"We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,\" Ilya Sutskever is reported to have said\"We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,\" he's widely reported to have said, though it's unclear who he meant by \"we\".It sheds light on a strange fact: many leading computer scientists and tech leaders, some of whom are working hard to develop a hugely intelligent form of AI, also seem deeply afraid of what it could one day do.So when exactly - if ever - will AGI arrive? And could it really prove transformational enough to make ordinary people afraid?An arrival 'sooner than we think'Tech leaders have claimed that AGI is imminent. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said in December 2024 that it will come \"sooner than most people in the world think\". Sir Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, has predicted in the next five to ten years, while Anthropic founder Dario Amodei wrote last year that his preferred term - \"powerful AI\" - could be with us as early as 2026.Others are dubious. \"They move the goalposts all the time,\" says Dame Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at Southampton University. \"It depends who you talk to.\" We are on the phone but I can almost hear the eye-roll.\"The scientific community says AI technology is amazing,\" she adds, \"but it's nowhere near human intelligence.\"There would need to be a number of \"fundamental breakthroughs\" first, agrees Babak Hodjat, chief technology officer of the tech firm Cognizant.What's more, it's unlikely to arrive as a single moment. Rather, AI is a rapidly advancing technology, it's on a journey and there are many companies around the world racing to develop their own versions of it.Sign up for BBC InDepth notificationsBut one reason the idea excites some in Silicon Valley is that it's thought to be a pre-cursor to something even more advanced: ASI, or artificial super intelligence - tech that surpasses human intelligence.It was back in 1958 that the concept of \"the singularity\" was attributed posthumously to Hungarian-born mathematician John von Neumann. It refers to the moment when computer intelligence advances beyond human understanding.Getty ImagesJohn von Neumann is credited with one of the earliest mentions of the singularity concept, long before it had a name - he was a physicist, mathematician, economist and computer scientist More recently, the 2024 book Genesis, written by Eric Schmidt, Craig Mundy and the late Henry Kissinger, explores the idea of a super-powerful technology that becomes so efficient at decision-making and leadership we end up handing control to it completely.It's a matter of when, not if, they argue.Money for all, without needing a job?Those in favour of AGI and ASI are almost evangelical about its benefits. It will find new cures for deadly diseases, solve climate change and invent an inexhaustible supply of clean energy, they argue. Elon Musk has even claimed that super-intelligent AI could usher in an era of \"universal high income\".He recently endorsed the idea that AI will become so cheap and widespread that virtually anyone will want their \"own personal R2-D2 and C-3PO\" (referencing the droids from Star Wars).\"Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance,\" he enthused.There is a scary side, of course. Could the tech be hijacked by terrorists and used as an enormous weapon, or what if it decides for itself that humanity is the cause of the world's problems and destroys us?AFP via Getty ImagesElon Musk has endorsed the idea everyone will want their own R2-D2 and C-3PO\"If it's smarter than you, then we have to keep it contained,\" warned Tim Berners Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, talking to the BBC earlier this month.\"We have to be able to switch it off.\"Governments are taking some protective steps. In the US, where many leading AI companies are based, President Biden passed an executive order in 2023 that required some firms to share safety test results with the federal government - though President Trump has since revoked some of the order, calling it a \"barrier\" to innovation.Meanwhile in the UK, the AI Safety Institute - a government-funded research body - was set up two years ago to better understand the risks posed by advanced AI.And then there are those super-rich with their own apocalypse insurance plans. Getty Images\"Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance,\" billionaire Musk once enthused\"Saying you're 'buying a house in New Zealand' is kind of a wink, wink, say no more,\" Reid Hoffman previously said. The same presumably goes for bunkers.But there's a distinctly human flaw.I once met a former bodyguard of one billionaire with his own \"bunker\", who told me his security team's first priority, if this really did happen, would be to eliminate said boss and get in the bunker themselves. And he didn't seem to be joking.Is it all alarmist nonsense?Neil Lawrence is a professor of machine learning at Cambridge University. To him, this whole debate in itself is nonsense.\"The notion of Artificial General Intelligence is as absurd as the notion of an 'Artificial General Vehicle',\" he argues.\"The right vehicle is dependent on the context. I used an Airbus A350 to fly to Kenya, I use a car to get to the university each day, I walk to the cafeteria… There's no vehicle that could ever do all of this.\"For him, talk about AGI is a distraction.\"The technology we have [already] built allows, for the first time, normal people to directly talk to a machine and potentially have it do what they intend. That is absolutely extraordinary… and utterly transformational.\"The big worry is that we're so drawn in to big tech's narratives about AGI that we're missing the ways in which we need to make things better for people.\"Getty ImagesMark Zuckerberg, pictured with his wife Priscilla, has said that the underground space at his Hawaii compound is \"just like a little shelter\"Current AI tools are trained on mountains of data and are good at spotting patterns: whether tumour signs in scans or the word most likely to come after another in a particular sequence. But they do not \"feel\", however convincing their responses may appear.\"There are some 'cheaty' ways to make a Large Language Model (the foundation of AI chatbots) act as if it has memory and learns, but these are unsatisfying and quite inferior to humans,\" says Mr Hodjat.Vince Lynch, CEO of the California-based IV.AI, is also wary of overblown declarations about AGI.\"It's great marketing,\" he says \"If you are the company that's building the smartest thing that's ever existed, people are going to want to give you money.\"He adds, \"It's not a two-years-away thing. It requires so much compute, so much human creativity, so much trial and error.\"Getty ImagesFilms like 2001: A Space Odyssey have warned about the dangers of sentient computersAsked whether he believes AGI will ever materialise, there's a long pause.\"I really don't know.\"Intelligence without consciousnessIn some ways, AI has already taken the edge over human brains. A generative AI tool can be an expert in medieval history one minute and solve complex mathematical equations the next.Some tech companies say they don't always know why their products respond the way they do. Meta says there are some signs of its AI systems improving themselves.Ultimately, though, no matter how intelligent machines become, biologically the human brain still wins. It has about 86 billion neurons and 600 trillion synapses, many more than the artificial equivalents.Researchers are studying the brain in attempts to better understand consciousnessThe brain doesn't need to pause between interactions either, and it is constantly adapting to new information.\"If you tell a human that life has been found on an exoplanet, they will immediately learn that, and it will affect their world view going forward.

    "body": "16 hours agoSammy AwamiBBC Africa, AntananarivoSammy Awami / BBCRazanasoa Edmondine looking at the photos on her phone of her new grandsonRazanasoa Edmondine still looks shell-shocked as she recalls the death of her one-month-old grandson, killed by police tear gas in protests that have rocked Madagascar over the last two weeks.\"It was just a normal Friday. My daughter-in-law was going to the market with the baby when they encountered demonstrators on the road,\" she tells the BBC at the family's home on the northern outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo.\"Not long after, police showed up and started dispersing the protest with tear gas.\"It was the second day of youth-led protests, triggered by anger over persistent power and water shortages, and Ms Edmondine's daughter-in-law ran into a nearby building with other protesters to take cover.Police then fired more tear gas canisters into the building, quickly filling it with choking smoke.With the streets in chaos, they could not get to a hospital until the following day. By then, the damage had been done.\"The baby was trying to cry but no sound came out,\" says Ms Edmondine softly.\"It was like something was blocking his chest. The doctor told us he had inhaled too much smoke. A couple of days later, he passed away.\"Protest organiser tells the BBC the country needs \"radical change\"Her grandchild is one of at least 22 people the UN says were killed during clashes between police and demonstrators in the early days of the protests, which have since escalated into broader dissatisfaction over corruption, high unemployment and the cost-of-living crisis in one of the world's poorest nations.The government of President Andry Rajoelina has dismissed this figure as misinformation but has not provided its own numbers.However, it has emphasised that the value of property damage exceeds $47m (£35m). The first days of the protests were marked by widespread violence, with cars set on fire, shop windows smashed and a two-month-old, multi-million-dollar cable car station vandalised.Rabe, who only gave the BBC his first name, has accused the police of firing live bullets at peaceful protesters - a few blocks away from where Ms Edmondine's daughter-in-law was hiding.As police launched tear gas, panic spread fast and people fled in every direction, seeking shelter inside any open building, but he says his 20-year-old autistic son did not understand what was happening.\"He must have slipped outside to see what was going on. That's when the police shot him and continued chasing other protesters.\"He believes his son was shot from the front, as the bullet left a large open wound in his back - the likely exit wound.\"I don't know much, but as far as I know, when someone raises their hands, it means they haven't stolen anything, they haven't vandalised anything,\" says Rabe. \"He was just there to see what was happening.\"Responding to accusations of police brutality, earlier this week President Rajoelina said: \"There have been deaths, we completely agree. And I truly sympathise with the suffering and pain of the families who have lost loved ones.\"But I want to tell you that these deaths are not protesters, they are not students. They are rioters. They are the ones who looted.\"AFP/Getty ImagesThe protests were triggered by anger over a lack of access to water and electricitySome business owners say the prolonged protests have disrupted commercial activity and cut into their income, especially for those in city centre neighbourhoods around the University of Antananarivo, from where the protests have been organised.\"I fully support Gen Z, but I don't think protests are the right way to address their grievances. When people demonstrate, I can't do business,\" says Laza Brenda, who runs a roadside mobile phone repair kiosk.For entrepreneur Ulrichia Rabefitiavana, the uncertainty has spooked several of her international clients, who have cancelled contracts for training and seminar events.\"We've had to postpone a major event involving more than 2,000 people that we've been preparing for over six months. It was supposed to take place this week. It's been very challenging for us to postpone everything and lose that money,\" says Ms Rabefitiavana.The tourism sector on the Indian Ocean island, which is famous for its unique wildlife, is among the hardest hit with the situation catching most people by surprise.\"We have received nothing but cancellations. Normally, the period of mid-September and October is the busiest period for us,\" says François van Rens from the Radisson Hotel Group.\"We normally operate around 60, 70% occupancy but we have now dropped down to 10%. So it's like in full throttle and all of the sudden the handbrake.\"Sammy Awami / BBCThis woman earns $2.30 a week selling doughnuts - with which she must support her young sonThe anger of the youth movement behind the demonstrations, known as Gen Z Mada, has grown with the protesters now calling for the president to step down.The evidence of young people's frustrations, whether it is unemployment, water scarcity or struggling businesses, is not hard to find across Antananarivo.At the airport, for example, visitors with just a few bags are quickly surrounded by two or three young people eager to help in exchange for a small tip.Anyone leaving their car parked outside a cafe or restaurant will almost certainly be approached by a couple of young men asking for a fee after claiming they have \"guarded\" the vehicle.On the roadside, a young woman selling sweet doughnuts tells the BBC she earns $2.30 a week, money she relies on to feed her four-year-old child.\"I'm only allowed to do business at this spot on weekends because during the week someone else uses it for their own business,\" she says while turning the dough in boiling oil.Driving through the outskirts of Antananarivo, it is common to see families washing clothes in paddy fields, a visible reminder of the severe water shortages in people's homes.ReutersWater is hard to come by for most in the city and people have to buy it from water sellersOne of the main protest organisers, who requested anonymity for safety reasons and organised to meet us near the rice fields, told the BBC he had to walk a mile each day to get water from a well – and he considers himself middle-class.\"To be a young person in Madagascar, you have to be tough,\" he adds, explaining that insecurity is rife.\"You live in constant fear of when your house will be broken into, when you will be shot by people, when you'll be stabbed on the streets. It's like your humanity has been stolen from you and taken away.\"He demands \"radical change\" to deal with the island's chronic socio-economic challenges.According to Hery Ramiarison, professor of economics at the University of Antananarivo, these are the result of decades of poor economic planning and the government's failure to create inclusive wealth.\"There is a huge employment problem among young people,\" he explains.\"It stems from very low levels of education in the labour force, serious deficiencies in the education system both in quantity and quality, widespread school dropouts, and a near-total absence of training opportunities adapted for them.\"The academic finds it striking that after 64 years of independence, three-quarters of the population have an education level below primary school, while only 3% have attained higher education.Sammy Awami / BBCLaza Brenda says he supports the Gen Z demands but says protests are bad for businessPresident Rajoelina has asked the Malagasy people to give him one year to fix the problems driving the protests, saying he will resign if fails to meet the deadline.But Prof Ramiarison feels the president does not understand the complexities of how Madagascar has become trapped in two vicious circles of poverty that feed into each other.One is driven by weak economic growth, the other stems from political instability, which discourages investment and growth and pushes people deeper into poverty, fuelling social unrest.\"To break free from the poverty trap, it is essential to first break the primary vicious circle by addressing its root causes - namely the key determinants of economic growth,\" he says.Madagascar has experienced repeated political turmoil since gaining independence from France, including the mass protests in 2009 that toppled then-President Marc Ravalomanana - the once popular dairy tycoon.That saw the rise of Rajoelina, a former DJ and then the mayor of Antananarivo, who seized power in the aftermath.From his roadside phone shop, Mr Brenda says: \"Once they're in power, they forget us. It's always the same.\"More on Madagascar's Gen Z crisis:Behind the Gen Z protesters who want to force Madagascar's president from powerPolice fire rubber bullets as Madagascar protesters reject president's promisesArmy general named as Madagascar PM to quell Gen Z protestsGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts"

    "body": "24 hours agoTom Batemanstate department correspondent andElaine OkyereBBC News EPAUp to 200 US troops already based in the Middle East will be moved to Israel to help monitor the ceasefire in Gaza, according to US officials.The US military will establish a multinational taskforce in Israel, known as a civil-military coordination centre, which is likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE, they said.One senior official said no US forces will enter Gaza, adding that the American role was to create a Joint Control Center which will \"integrate\" the multinational force going in.The Israeli government has approved the first phase of a Gaza deal with Hamas, which has led to a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners. Israel-Gaza war ceasefire live updatesThe taskforce will be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance.The multinational force will inform both the Israelis and Hamas via Egypt and Qatar of the situation on the ground and any potential violations of the truce, one of the officials said.The force is being established under the leadership of Adm Brad Cooper, head of Centcom. He joined the American delegation for part of indirect talks in Egypt earlier this week, one of the officials said. Those talks led to US President Donald Trump announcing on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had \"signed off on the first phase\" of a peace plan he unveiled last week. One of the point's in Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy in Gaza but this is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange is completed.Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Since then, Israel's massive military offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. These figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies."

    "body": "16 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, Jerusalem andBBC Visual Journalism teamGetty ImagesA ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump.The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media.It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose.Even its title, \"Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War\", leaves room for different interpretations.The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid.However, by highlighting \"Comprehensive end of Gaza war\", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war.This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume.This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting.Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended.Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. \"If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,\" he said.The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan.This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation.And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help.Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located.The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive.This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations.US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides.Next phase of deal unclearThis deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help.Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage.Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting.What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain."

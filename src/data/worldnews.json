    "body": "<div><p>Fifa has accused Malaysia of falsifying citizenship documents so<b> </b>seven foreign-born players could play for the national team.</p><p>Football's world governing body had fined and suspended the players in late September and on Monday released a report justifying its action.</p><p>Fifa said the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) had forged birth certificates to make it look like the players' grandparents were born in Malaysia. This, the body said, \"constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating\".</p><p>But FAM said the discrepancies arose from an \"administrative error\" and that it would appeal Fifa's penalties. It maintained that the players were \"legitimate Malaysian citizens\".</p></div><div><p>Fifa's \"grandfather rule\" allows foreign-born football players to represent countries that their biological parents or grandparents were born in. This aims to prevent national football teams from simply importing foreign players to boost performance.</p><p>Fifa investigated the players following Malaysia's 4-0 win against Vietnam in June, in response to questions about their eligibility.</p><p>In September, the Fifa disciplinary committee suspended the seven players<b> </b>for a year and ordered them to pay a fine of 2,000 Swiss francs ($2,500; £1,870). At the time, Fifa did not share details about the reason for their suspension, only that it related to \"doctored documentation\".</p><p>The football governing<b> </b>body ordered FAM to pay 350,000 Swiss francs ($440,000; £330,000).</p><p>In recent years, South East Asian countries have launched recruitment drives for naturalised players, hoping to emulate Indonesia's strategy of recruiting Dutch-born footballers from the Indonesian diaspora.</p><p>Earlier this year, FAM sent Fifa birth certificates showing that the grandparents of its seven players had been<b> </b>born in Malaysian cities like Penang and Malacca. </p><p>But Fifa said investigators obtained original birth certificates of the grandparents, which showed that they were born in countries like Argentina and Spain - all corresponding with the players' birthplaces.</p><p>The seven players include Spanish-born Gabriel Felipe Arrocha, Facundo Tomas Garces and Jon Irazabal Iraurgui, Argentinian-born Rodrigo Julian Holgado and Imanol Javier Machuca, Netherlands-born Hector Alejandro Hevel Serrano and Brazilian-born Joao Vitor Brandao Figueiredo.</p><p>Malaysia's sports minister Hannah Yeoh said Fifa's findings had tarnished the country's image. She said the ministry would wait for FAM's appeal to be over before making any official statement. </p><p>\"I also understand that all local football fans are naturally angry, disappointed and want to see improvements,\" she told a news conference on Tuesday, according to government news agency Bernama.</p><p>Malaysia is set to play against Laos in another Asian Cup qualifier this week - though the Malaysian team's line-up will look much different without the sanctioned players.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>A 30-year-old woman has become the third person to die from methanol poisoning in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, as the authorities investigate the source of the tainted drinks thought to be making people ill.</p><p>Bruna Araújo de Souza died after consuming a vodka drink at a bar more than a week ago, according to officials in the city of São Bernardo. It comes after health officials announced the deaths of two men. </p><p>There has been a total of 225 confirmed cases of methanol poisoning in Brazil so far, according to the health ministry's latest update. Most of these have been in São Paulo. </p><p>At least 11 businesses have been closed and more than 10,000 bottles of alcohol seized by authorities.</p></div><div><p>It is unclear whether the contamination was intentional or accidental, and people are being asked to avoid consuming drinks without labels, safety seals or tax stamps. </p><p>Methanol is a type of alcohol commonly found in cleaning products, fuel and antifreeze. It is highly poisonous, even in small amounts. </p><p>Symptoms of methanol poisoning are similar to a hangover, meaning it can be hard for a person to know if they have been affected.</p></div><div><p>Ms Souza was hospitalised in a critical condition and tests showed she had methanol in her system, as did her boyfriend, according to an obituary posted online. She was later confirmed to be brain dead. </p><p>The two men who have died have been named in Brazilian media as Marcos Antônio Jorge Júnior and Ricardo Lopes Mira. They are both from the city of São Paulo.</p><p>Mira, 54, died on 16 September, having fallen ill a few days before, while Júnior, 46, died on 2 October after drinking vodka in a bar. </p><p>Both São Paulo state and national health officials say they are investigating other suspected methanol poisoning deaths. </p><p>The manager of a bar near Paulista Avenue, one of the busiest areas in the city of São Paulo, told the Associated Press: \"Clients have been worried, and we're advising them it's better not to drink cocktails.\"</p><p>Among those who have been hospitalised with suspected methanol poisoning is the Brazilian rapper Hungria, who posted a picture of himself in hospital on social media with a caption saying \"if you feel thirsty, find a safe place to drink\". </p><p>Brazil's Health Minister Alexandre Padilha has described the situation as \"abnormal and unlike anything else in our history regarding methanol poisoning in the country\".</p><p>This is not the first time Brazil has had to deal with an outbreak of methanol poisoning. At least 51 people died in the northeast region of Bahia in 1999. </p><p>More recently, at least 54 people died in 2022 during an outbreak in neighbouring Peru. </p><p>Thousands of people suffer from methanol poisoning each year, according  to medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - with the majority of outbreaks happening in Asia.</p><p>Lack of regulations and awareness by the public, including tourists, are among the main reasons given for why these outbreaks take place.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>A judge in Albania has been shot dead after a man opened fire during a trial at the Court of Appeal in the capital, Tirana.</p><p>Judge Astrit Kalaja died en route to hospital, officials said, while two others involved in the hearing over a property dispute - a father and son - were shot but sustained injuries that were not life-threatening.</p><p>Police said they had arrested a 30-year-old male suspect who they identified by the initials \"E Sh\", but Albanian media have named as Elvis Shkëmbi. </p><p>His uncle, a defendant in the case, has also been arrested, as has a security guard whom, the authorities claim, let the alleged gunman into the building, even after he set off a metal detector.</p></div><div><p>Albanian state police say Mr Shkëmbi shot Judge Kalaja \"several times\" using a pistol which he removed from his belt immediately after a verdict was announced.</p><p>He then allegedly turned the gun on the two plaintiffs, wounding them both.</p><p>According to the authorities, the 63-year-old security officer, who they refer to as \"BK\", failed to physically check the two men or to register them in a \"protocol book\" where all people entering or leaving the Court of Appeal must be recorded.</p><p>The suspect and his uncle were then able to hang around the lobby for nearly an hour prior to the hearing. </p></div><div><p>After the shooting, Mr Shkëmbi allegedly left the room and handed a pistol to a court clerk.</p><p>His uncle \"did not take any action to stop his nephew's criminal actions\", police said, adding that this \"creates reasonable suspicion that he was aware of the plan to execute the judge in the case, in the role of instigator and/or assistant\".</p><p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama, meanwhile, offered his condolences to Judge Kalaja's family, saying: \"The criminal aggression against the judge undoubtedly requires the most extreme legal response toward the aggressor.\"</p><p>He also called for stricter security within the country's courts and harsher punishments for the illegal possession of weapons.</p><p>The country's general prosecutor Olsian Çela said: \"Beyond the heartbreaking loss of one life and the injury of two others, this event strikes at the very foundation of justice and the functioning of the legal system.\"</p><p>Judge Kalaja was a lawyer for more than 30 years. He initially worked in a district court before being appointed to Tirana's Court of Appeal in 2019.</p><p>Firearm attacks on judges in the courtroom are rare but they do happen. A decade ago, a judge in Milan's Palace of Justice was shot and killed by a man on trial in a bankruptcy case. He also killed a lawyer and his co-defendant before escaping, but was later arrested.</p><p>Albania had the highest number of firearm incidents linked to public disputes in the first six months of this year among Balkan nations, according to a UN-backed regional monitor.</p><p>Between January and June, there were 43 instances in which a firearm was involved in a public dispute in Albania - out of a total of 213 firearm-related incidents.</p><p>That is less than the number recorded in the same period last year. </p></div>",

It was thought he had what it took to fix a discreet deal between the parties and save French politics from implosion.</p><p>But as it turns out, that wasn't the case. </p><p>Lecornu has arguably gone down in even more embarrassing circumstances than his two ill-fated predecessors.</p><p>At least Michel Barnier and François Bayrou both presided for a short while over their governments, and tabled a few ideas.</p><p>Lecornu, on the other hand, named his cabinet late Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had lost it. He didn't even get to make his inaugural address to parliament, which was planned for Tuesday. </p><p>His government lasted for precisely 14 hours.</p></div><div><p>The immediate cause of his calamitous fin de régime is now clear. It was the conservative Republicans party (LR) and their leader, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.</p><p>With its 40 or so MPs, the LR has become a key part of the centre-right alliance that is trying to run France.</p><p>Retailleau has made much of his presence in government about projecting himself and his party as natural candidates for the offices of state. </p><p>Earlier on Sunday, he'd told Lecornu that he was willing to stay on as minister. But within an hour of the cabinet being announced, he posted on social media that there'd been a change of heart: LR might not be joining after all. </p><p>Officially it was because Lecornu had done the dirty by naming former finance minister Bruno Le Maire as his pick for defence. </p><p>Le Maire - a former party colleague - is a particular bugbear of LR, partly because he betrayed them by joining Macron, and partly because they blame him for letting French debt spiral out of control when in control of the country's finances.</p><p>Either way, LR accuses Lecornu of hiding Le Maire's nomination - apparently Retailleau didn't learn of it until he turned on his television.</p><p>And at the end of Monday there was a new twist. Le Maire agreed not to become a minister and Macron gave his outgoing prime minister a last-minute reprieve of 48 hours, to see if he could persuade LR into the government. </p><p>So, the situation remains fluid.</p><p>Whatever happens, the deeper truth is that the more time passes, the harder it is going to be for anyone - even the most gifted of Macron acolytes - to set up a stable government.</p><p>Why? Because the more time passes, the closer France gets to its next big electoral moment – the 2027 French presidential election.  </p><p>So unpopular is Macron today that all who associate themselves with him risk a severe beating the next time the public gets a chance to vote.</p><p>As a result, the fractious centre-right alliance at the heart of Macron-land is now beginning to splinter.  </p><p>The LR are out, but many centrists are starting to mutter too. Even the president's onetime wunderkind former prime minister Gabriel Attal is keeping his distance.</p><p>If it feels like the twilight of an era, then that is what it is. The faithful are leaving, preparing for a world without Macron. It might not be so far away.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>The committee which organised Syria's first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar al-Assad has acknowledged \"significant shortcomings\", after results showed only 13% of the seats contested were won by female and minority candidates.</p><p>Observers said six women and 10 members of religious and ethnic minorities were among the 119 people elected to the new People's Assembly on Sunday.</p><p>There was no direct popular vote. Instead, electoral colleges are selecting representatives for two-thirds of the 210 seats. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa is appointing the rest.</p><p>An election committee spokesman said the president's choices might \"compensate\" for the underrepresented components of society.</p></div><div><p>Twenty-one seats were not filled because the polls were postponed for security reasons in two Kurdish-controlled provinces in the north, and a third in the south which has seen deadly fighting between government forces and Druze militias.</p><p>Sharaa declared that the elections were a \"historic moment\" during a visit to a polling station and said the parliament would play an \"important oversight role\" during its 30-month term.</p><p>He promised a democratic and inclusive political transition after his Sunni Islamist group led the lightning rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime last December, ending a 13-year civil war that killed more than 600,000 people and displaced another 12 million.</p><p>However, the country has been rocked by several waves of deadly sectarian violence since then, fuelling fear and distrust among minorities.</p></div><div><p>Sunday's polls were overseen by the Higher Committee for the Syrian People's Assembly Elections, whose 11 members were chosen by the president in June.</p><p>They, in turn, appointed sub-committees which were tasked with selecting up to 7,000 members of 140 electoral colleges covering 60 districts.</p><p>The candidates representing the 50 districts where voting took place all had to be electoral college members. Supporters of \"the former regime or terrorist organisations\" were barred from membership, as were advocates of \"secession, division or seeking foreign intervention\".</p><p>In the end, women made up 14% of the 1,500 candidates, according to the Higher Committee.</p><p>However, there were no quotas for female lawmakers, nor for those from the country's many ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p>After publishing the preliminary election results on Monday, higher election committee spokesman Nawar Najmeh was asked by journalists to comment on the representation of women and Christians.</p><p>\"Among the most significant shortcomings of the electoral process were the unsatisfactory results for Syrian women's representation, and the fact that Christian representation was limited to two seats, a weak representation relative to the number of Christians in Syria,\" he told a news conference.</p><p>Election observers told Reuters news agency that two members of Assad's Alawite sect and several ethnic Kurds also won seats.</p><p>The US estimates that 10% of Syria's 24 million population is Christian. Sunni Muslims constitute 74%, other Muslim sects 13%, and Druze 3%.</p><p>Najmeh suggested that \"the president's third [of the seats] could compensate\" for some underrepresented components of society.</p><p>He also insisted that authorities were \"serious about having supplementary ballots\" in the northern provinces of Raqqa and Hassakeh, which are mostly controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).</p><p>However, he said the polls there would be linked to progress between the government and the SDF on the implementation of a March agreement to integrate all Kurdish-led military and civilian institutions into the state.</p><p>The Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political umbrella of the SDF-affiliated Autonomous Administration of North-East Syria (AANES), said the elections \"did not represent the Syrian people's will, and did not represent all regions and communities in the country\".</p><p>On Tuesday, Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra said he had agreed to a comprehensive ceasefire with the SDF's leader, Mazloum Abdi, following recent clashes in two Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods of the northern city of Aleppo.</p><p>The AANES accused the army of attacking residents of Ashrafieh and Sheikh Maksoud on Monday, while the interior ministry said the clashes erupted after the SDF shelled army checkpoints.</p><p>The government also holds little sway in the southern province of Suweida, where tensions with the predominantly Druze population have remained high since the sectarian violence there three months ago.</p><p>The violence erupted when Druze militias clashed with Sunni Bedouin tribes, which prompted the government to send its forces to intervene. More than 1,000 people were killed in the fighting, most of them Druze, according to monitoring groups.</p><p>One Druze cleric in Suweida, Fadi Badria, told the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the elections represented only the authority of what he called the \"terrorist\" interim government, and that they would \"not be recognised by the province\".</p></div>",

Thousands of federal employees were furloughed or ordered to work without pay when funding for their agencies ended five days ago.</p><p>But the US president hinted that he was open to trying to end the impasse and possibly strike a deal with Democrats who are sticking to demands that the legislation address healthcare. Republicans are pressing for a \"clean\" funding bill.</p></div><div><p>The Democratic-led bill to extend the government's funding failed first on Monday with a 45-50 vote. Its Republican counterpart then fell short at 52-42. </p><p>Soon after the vote, Trump took to social media to blame Democrats for shutting down the government.</p><p>\"I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!\" he posted on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>Democrats have held out on supporting the Republican-led proposal because they say it undercuts medical access for lower-income Americans. </p><p>They want any funding bill to ensure health insurance subsidies for lower-income Americans do not expire and to reverse the Trump administration's cuts to the Medicaid health programme.</p><p>Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants - something Democratic leaders deny. They have also said that they will work on the healthcare issue in separate legislation, after the government reopens.</p><p>Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump said he is currently negotiating with Democratic leadership on possible healthcare provisions.</p><p>\"We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things. And I'm talking about good things with regard to healthcare,\" he said.</p><p>But Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, wrote on X that \"THIS ISN'T TRUE\". </p><p>The White House has warned since the shutdown started last Wednesday that permanent firings of federal employees were \"imminent\". </p><p>Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that on Monday, saying the Office of Management and Budget was already working with agencies that would have to lay people off. </p><p>\"We don't want to see people laid off. But unfortunately, if this shutdown continues, layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,\" she said. </p><p>Leavitt also called on Democratic lawmakers to relent.</p><p>\"There's nothing to negotiate. Just reopen the government,\" she said.</p><p>In separate interviews with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, the House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, and top Republican, Speaker Mike Johnson, each blamed the other's party for the continued stand-off.</p><p>Jeffries accused Republicans of \"lying\" about Democrats' intentions in the negotiations \"because they're losing the court of public opinion\".</p><p>But Johnson said Democrats were \"not serious\" and negotiating in bad faith.</p><p>\"They're doing this to get political cover,\" he said.</p><p>Recent polling from CBS, the BBC's US news partner, found that Americans view both parties' handling of the shutdown unfavourably, with Trump and congressional Republicans being blamed slightly more for the situation.</p></div>",

The result was a hung parliament in which Macron's centrist partners lost their majority and had to seek alliances with other parties.</p><p>The leader of one of those parties, Bruno Retailleau of the conservative Republicans, pulled out of Lecornu's government 14 hours after it was announced.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8aa5/live/ec3e0460-a394-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"EPA Newspapers with headlines reflecting the political crisis\" /><span>EPA</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Opinion polls suggest almost three-quarters of voters think Macron should step down</figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>It's all about France's debt</h2><p></p><div><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt and get over the ideological divisions between the centre-ground parties who could be part of a government.</p><p>Early this year public debt stood at €3,345 billion, or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy. France's budget deficit this year is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Michel Barnier and François Bayrou lasted only three and nine months respectively before being ousted in confidence votes as they tried to tackle the deficit with austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu did not even make it as far as presenting a budget plan. Criticism poured in from all sides as soon as he presented his cabinet on Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had decided his position was untenable.</p><p>He blamed his departure on the unmovable stance of parties who, he said, \"all behave as if they had a majority\".</p><p>All the parties have an eye on the next presidential votes in 2027, and they are also gearing up for the possibility of snap parliamentary elections in case Macron dissolves parliament again.</p></div><p></p><h2>Who are the key figures in this crisis?</h2><p></p><div><p>The leaders who have been calling on Macron to resign for months are on the hard right and radical left.</p><p>Marine Le Pen and her young lieutenant in the far-right National Rally, Jordan Bardella, are ready for elections and have refused Lecornu's invitation to talk.</p><p>Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) has been agitating for Macron's impeachment, although that seems unlikely. He is backed by the Greens.</p><p>Olivier Faure's centre-left Socialists were allied to the radical left during the last elections but have been talking to Lecornu on condition that he forms a left-wing government.</p><p>Then there is Gabriel Attal, who leads Macron's own centrist Renaissance party, but has said he no longer understands the president's decisions.</p><p>And on the centre-right is Bruno Retailleau, whose Republicans have been part of the so-called socle commun (common platform) with the centrists.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella walk down the street\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A snap election would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular</figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>What happens now?</h2><p></p><div><p>Lecornu has been deep in discussions with party representatives and has until Wednesday evening to present a \"platform of action and stability\" to Macron.</p><p>There are four options - and none of them look good.</p></div><div><ul><li>If Lecornu manages to persuade the centre-ground parties to form some kind of government, then Macron will be able to name a new prime minister, whoever that is. Lecornu has indicated he does not wish to take on the job, although that is not a definitive no. The omens are not great. When he resigned on Monday Lecornu said: \"I was ready for compromise but all parties wanted the other party to adopt their programmes in their entirety.\" But France does need to pass some kind of 2026 budget to tackle its national debt, and the factions know that.</li><li>If Lecornu fails, the Elysee has indicated that Macron would \"take responsibility\". That would probably mean fresh parliamentary elections, which would spell bad news for his centrist allies and the Socialists but would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular. Elections would need to take place a maximum of 40 days after parliament is dissolved - which would mean voting in November.</li><li>Macron's presidency ends in 18 months but he is facing increasing calls to step down. He has repeatedly rejected early presidential elections, but it is not out of the question. Former Macron minister Benjamin Haddad argues that his resignation would make no sense  as the next president would just face the same problem: \"The political divide is here to stay.\"</li><li>Even without a government agreement, the parties could put aside their differences in parliament and come to a compromise on a limited budget. But French politics is not known for its culture of compromise.</li></ul></div><p></p><h2>Has Macron run out of road?</h2><p></p><div><p>After his third prime minister in the past year announced his resignation on Monday, Macron went for a long walk along the River Seine, his mobile phone to his ear.</p><p>A stunt for the cameras? Perhaps, but it was symbolic of the solitary nature of his position, as he confronts some of the hardest choices of his presidency and some of his former allies appear to be deserting him.</p><p>But the president will have known for some time of the political challenges ahead and he is not one to give up without a fight -<b> </b>or another bid to stabilise an increasingly ungovernable France. There is a sense that time may be running out for the master of the clocks.</p></div></article>",

An appeals court is set to review the move in the coming days.</p><p>\"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" Judge Karin Immergut, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, wrote in her Saturday opinion. </p><p>\"Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power - to the detriment of this nation.\"</p></div><div><p>Once the appellate court has its say, the Supreme Court could step in via its so-called \"shadow docket\", issuing a ruling that could curtail Trump's ability to use the military on US soil - or give him a free hand, at least temporarily.</p><p>Such reviews have become a more routine occurrence recently, as a majority of the Supreme Court justices, in response to emergency petitions from the Trump administration, has largely allowed the president's actions to move forward while legal challenges play out.</p><p>\"A tug of war between the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts is going to be a driving force in the coming term,\" Samuel Bray, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said at a briefing last month.</p><p>The court's reliance on this shadow docket has been criticised by left-leaning legal scholars and politicians as an improper use of the court's authority. Its orders have typically been short, offering limited legal reasoning and leaving lower-level judges with minimal guidance.</p><p>\"All Americans should be alarmed by the Supreme Court's growing reliance on its shadow docket to resolve controversial and high-profile cases without any transparency - no substantive explanations, oral arguments, or reasoning,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said earlier this year.</p><p>\"This further pushes the Court's deliberations and decisions out of view of public scrutiny and shields it from accountability.\"</p><p>In the coming months, however, the court is set tackle questions of presidential power – and other high-profile controversies - head on, hearing oral arguments and issuing full decisions on their merits.</p><p>\"It's not going to be able to get away with one-page orders that don't explain the reasoning,\" said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who specialises in the Supreme Court and US politics. \"If they're going to grant more power to the executive its going to have to explain why.\"</p><p>The court is already scheduled to consider whether federal laws prohibit the president from removing members of agencies designed by Congress to be independent from presidential influence infringe on executive authority.</p><p>The justices will also hear arguments in an expedited review of Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her position as a governor on the influential Federal Reserve Board – a case that could dramatically increase the president's power over American economic policy.</p><p>The US – and global economy – is also front and centre as Supreme Court justices will have a chance to decide whether many of Trump's unilaterally imposed tariffs on foreign imports have adequate legal authority or should be voided.</p><p>The justices may also review Trump's attempts to unilaterally cut federal spending and fire lower-level government employees, as well as his aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p><p>While the court has not yet agreed to consider Trump's attempt to terminate automatic citizenship for those born on US soil, it could do so in the coming months.</p><p>\"The scope of executive power will be front and centre this term,\" said Professor Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School, in an email to the BBC.</p><p>\"The cases coming before the court will test the Trump administration's highest political and economic priorities, whether tariffs or birthright citizenship.</p><p>\"One question will be whether the justices will apply principles (eg the major questions doctrine) that it used to strike down signature Biden initiatives in a politically even-handed way.\"</p><p>The court used its newly fashioned \"major questions doctrine\" to stymie Biden's efforts at student loan forgiveness and environmental regulations, holding that Congress did not give him explicit authorisation to do so.</p><p>Presidential power is the central focus of this year's Supreme Court term but cases involving several hot-button political and cultural controversies are also scheduled in the coming months.</p><p>The court will review whether a Colorado ban on conversion therapy – a controversial practice that attempts to use counselling to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity – violates constitutional free speech protections.</p><p>Also on the docket are two cases involving state bans on transgender athletes in interscholastic sport competition.</p><p>A Republican congressman in Illinois is challenging a state law that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day.</p><p>A group of Louisiana conservatives have asked the court to strike down a provision of a voting rights law that requires states to draw congressional districts that guarantee Black voter representation equal to their population level.</p><p>And the Republican Party is targeting a decades-old law that prevents political candidates and parties from coordinating their campaign spending.</p><p>Over the past few years, this conservative-dominated Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to issue landmark new rulings that have dramatically shifted America's legal landscape.</p><p>On topics like abortion rights, federal regulatory authority and the consideration of race in college admissions, the court has reversed decades of existing precedent.</p><p>Those decisions have contributed to a public view of the Supreme Court that has become increasingly polarised along partisan lines.</p><p>In a recent Pew Foundation poll, opinions of the nation's highest legal body were split nearly evenly, with Republicans supportive and Democrats highly critical.</p><p>By the time the court issues its final decisions in this term, expected by the end of June next year, the 6-3 conservative majority on the court may have broken new ground, and once again fundamentally reshaped American law.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Kayla Epstein</i></p></div>",

It lived up to that billing.</p><p>The attorney general was making her first appearance at a congressional oversight hearing - and it was a timely one.</p><p>Two weeks ago, her justice department <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r872egvjo\">indicted former FBI Director James Comey</a>, triggering an outcry from Democratic politicians.</p><p>Her testimony on Tuesday also came just a day after a group of former justice department employees released a letter accusing Bondi of helping to take a \"sledgehammer\" to \"longstanding work the department has done to protect communities and the rule of law\".</p><p>Nerves were raw, and Bondi was clearly ready for a fight. Here are five takeaways from the hearing.</p></div><p></p><h2>1. Bondi goes on the attack</h2><p></p><div><p>Recent Trump administration officials, including Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and FBI Director Kash Patel, have relied on a clear playbook for testimony before hostile congressional committees. </p><p>Go on the attack early and often.</p><p>That strategy was on display throughout Bondi's testimony. When pressed on National Guard deployments, she said she wished Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and California Senator Alex Padilla loved their states \"as much as they hate Donald Trump\".</p><p>When questioned about Jeffrey Epstein, she noted that several Democratic senators had taken money from deep-pocketed donors who had ties to the late convicted sex trafficker.</p><p>Bondi launched a series of pointed attacks on senators as they questioned her.</p><p>And when it was time for junior Vermont Senator Peter Welch to ask questions, he began by observing Bondi's penchant for launching personal attacks.</p><p>\"I'll be waiting for my turn,\" the soft-spoken New Englander said. \"But you don't have to do it now\".</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump says “there will be others” after Comey indictment</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Lots of questions, few answers</h2><p></p><div><p>When Bondi wasn't going on the attack, she frequently declined to comment on questions from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>She said she wouldn't discuss \"personnel matters\" when questioned about the spate of senior level justice department firings, including top FBI officials and a US lawyer who had recommended against the Comey indictment.</p><p>She wouldn't comment on \"ongoing investigations\" and legal proceedings – including the Comey case. She also wouldn't shed light on conversations she has had with the president or other White House aides.</p><p>When presented with a large photograph of her sitting at a table with the president the day after Trump had penned a Truth Social post calling for her to indict Comey, her only remark was that she loved the picture.</p><p>\"This is supposed to be an oversight hearing where members of Congress can get serious answers to serious questions,\" California Senator Adam Schiff said, after listing all the questions that Bondi had refused to answer.</p><p>\"I think you owe the president an apology for your entire career,\" Bondi replied.</p></div><p></p><h2>3. Bondi keen to focus on crime</h2><p></p><div><p>Bondi appeared determined to focus on what she said was the Trump administration's goal of reducing crime in the US.</p><p>She was quick to cite statistics that she said showed the successes they have had so far – the number of arrests in Washington DC, the drug crackdowns and illegal firearm confiscations in Chicago, the drug seizures at the border.</p><p>\"We are returning to our core mission of fighting real crime,\" Bondi said.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r872egvjo\">Trump urged prosecutors to target Comey. Now he's been charged</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgg4vgeedo\">Trump pushes justice department to prosecute his political opponents</a></li></ul><p>Democrats may have had other ideas, but Bondi - and the White House - likely feel they are on the safest political ground when they talk about crime-fighting. </p><p>It is an issue that, according to the polls, many Americans care about – and one that has the potential to appeal not just to die-hard conservative partisans, but to independent and Democratic voters as well.</p></div><p></p><h2>4. But Democrats focus on Epstein</h2><p></p><div><p>A source of particular heat for Bondi over the past few months has been the justice department's handling of its investigation into Epstein, who before his death had well documented ties to many rich and powerful Americans.</p><p>For most of the hearing, Democrats were the ones peppering Bondi with Epstein-related questions.</p><p>Senator Sheldon Whitehouse wanted to know if the FBI had discovered pictures of Trump and \"half-naked young women\", and whether the justice department had looked into \"suspicious activity reports\" about Epstein's finances. </p><p>Bondi wouldn't answer.</p><p>Dick Durbin asked about claims that the justice department had flagged anything in its Epstein documents related to Trump to the president.</p><p>\"I'm not going to discuss anything about that with you, senator,\" Bondi replied.</p><p>The attorney general was asked why her department now says there is no list of Epstein's clients after she earlier claimed to have that information on her desk.</p><p>Bondi responded by citing the department's previous finding that there was no evidence of conspiracy or a cover-up surrounding the investigation.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, speaks as he attends an oversight hearing of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Capitol Hill in Washington\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The hearing was testy - with both parties attacking the other in their questioning</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The questions still swirling around the Epstein investigation have been a rare source of bipartisan interest, with some Republicans joining Democrats to call for more transparency. It took a while, but this Senate hearing finally gave some indication of that.</p><p>Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana recounted recent comments by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that Epstein was \"the greatest blackmailer ever\".</p><p>The Louisiana senator suggested Lutnick, who owned a home near Epstein in Palm Beach Florida, should testify before Congress and speak to the FBI.</p><p>Bondi continued her Epstein dance, saying it was up to Lutnick and FBI Director Kash Patel to decide if a meeting was necessary.</p></div><p></p><h2>5. Republicans look back in anger</h2><p></p><div><p>If Democrats were focused on what they view as the unprecedented weaponisation of the justice department under Trump, most of the Republican senators were more interested in fighting battles from the Biden presidency – or earlier.</p><p>Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley spent much of the hearings interjecting on how Democrats had, in his view, stonewalled investigations into the Biden family's business dealings.</p><p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham condemned the FBI's Russia investigation following the 2016 presidential election. Ted Cruz of Texas focused on protests outside the homes of conservative Supreme Court justices in the wake of their 2021 decision overturning abortion rights. </p><p>Eric Schmidt of Missouri filled out a veritable bingo card of right-wing complaints directed at the justice department.</p><p>Bondi, for her part, wholeheartedly agreed with the Republican chorus.</p><p>When the five-hour hearing finally concluded, the event had the feeling of a partisan house of mirrors, with each side accusing the other of political weaponisation and partisan prosecutions.</p><p>\"The Department of Justice is supposed to be the nation's guardian of fairness and the rule of law,\" Senator Alex Padilla said during his questioning. \"When the public trust breaks down, then justice itself is at risk.\"</p><p>It is the kind of comment that both Republicans and Democrats on the committee could agree with – before casting the other side as the source of the nation's ills.</p></div></article>",

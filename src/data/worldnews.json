He is also the patron saint of animals and the environment.The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226.The late Pope Francis, who died last year after leading the Roman Catholic Church for more than a decade, chose his name and modelled his papacy after the radical humility of Saint Francis.St Francis of Assisi's bones will be on display until 22 March.

Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his \"deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims\". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape. The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.\"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous,\" the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently. A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that \"sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson\", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPhanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali, in Kathmandu,andHafsa KhalilEPAA 24-year-old British man is among 19 people who were killed in a bus crash in Nepal, police say.The bus - which had been carrying tourists - had been travelling to the capital, Kathmandu, when it lost control and fell 200m on to the bank of the Trishuli river, in the country's central Dhading district, in the early hours of Monday morning.There were 44 people onboard including the driver, 25 of whom suffered injuries. The bus had been travelling from Pokhara, a popular tourist spot.Nepal's Home Ministry has created a five-member taskforce to investigate the cause of the incident. The UK Foreign Office said it was assisting the family of the Briton who was killed.Nepalese authorities identified him as Stewart Dominic Ethan. His name has not been confirmed by the Foreign Office.Nepalese police say they have identified all 19 bodies, including a 40-year-old Chinese woman and a 32-year-old man from India. Among the injured is a Chinese national and a New Zealander.All the injured had been taken to hospitals in the capital, they added. Children were among those onboard.Multiple teams were sent to the site, including police units, the army and a rescue team of divers, authorities said.Police spokesman Abinarayan Kafle said 17 people died at the scene, with two more dying while receiving treatment, BBC Nepali reported.Road accidents are relatively commonplace in Nepal, due to a range of factors including poor road maintenance and narrow paths in mountainous areas.In 2024, at least 14 people died after a bus travelling from Pokhara to Kathmandu fell into the Marsyangdi river in the Tanahun district.\"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Nepal and are in contact with the local authorities,\" a Foreign Office spokesman told the BBC.Nepal is a popular destination for many international visitors, especially climbers, who travel there to access a key section of the Himalaya mountain range that includes Mount Everest.",

    "body": "Australian prosecutors consider reopening British girl's cold case disappearance12 hours agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentFamily handoutCheryl Grimmer was three when she disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in January 1970The family of a British girl who disappeared in Australia more than 55 years ago has welcomed a decision by prosecutors to consider reopening her case.Three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970. Despite extensive searches, there were no leads.A suspect was charged with her abduction and murder in 2017, but his trial collapsed after his teenage confession was ruled inadmissible. He denies any wrongdoing and prosecutors dropped the case.After public pressure - including from the girl's family - the New South Wales (NSW) director of public prosecutions now says her office is willing to conduct a special review of that decision.Sally Dowling said in a letter to Grimmer's family that the normal time limit for families to request a review had expired, but that she had agreed to look at the case anyway.She said she could review the case now, based on evidence police handed over in 2019, or the family could wait until detectives had considered the \"fresh\" information they say they have found.\"It's taken way too many years but finally we're really happy that they see our fight for some justice for Cheryl,\" Ricki Nash, Cheryl's older brother, told the BBC.Nash said the family had written to NSW Police to request it reopen an investigation, taking into account new evidence that had come to light since 2019.\"We are not asking for anything extraordinary,\" he said. \"When transparency leads the process, evil can no longer hide behind process failures or bureaucratic division.\"The British toddler and her family had only recently migrated to Australia from Bristol as so-called Ten Pound Poms before she vanished.On the day Cheryl disappeared, Nash had been put in charge of his younger siblings as the family got ready to leave the beach. He was told to go to the bathroom block and Cheryl ran giggling into the ladies' changing rooms, refusing to come out.Too embarrassed to enter himself, Nash went back to the beach to tell his mother to help. When they returned 90 seconds later, the toddler was gone.Cheryl's family has been pushing for a fresh investigation ever since the trial collapsed seven years ago. They argue that lots of missteps were made by NSW authorities in their search for Cheryl.Last October, Jeremy Buckingham, a member of the NSW Legislative Council, the state's upper house, used parliamentary privilege to name the suspect. He had been known only as Mercury, as his real name is legally protected because he was a minor at the time of the alleged crime.In May, there will also be a NSW parliamentary inquiry looking into cases of unsolved murders and long-term missing people – with Grimmer's case forming part of the inquiry.",

    "body": "23 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe US operates two dedicated hospital boats, including the USNS Mercy Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making \"random outbursts on social media\", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to \"take care\" of people on the island.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\".Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded \"it's going to be a no thanks from us,\" and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US. Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so. He later announced a \"framework for a future deal\" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were \"going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!\"The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear if Trump was referencing either of those ships, or what had prompted his decision. Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea \"is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens.\"\"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote on Facebook.Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.\"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,\" he said.Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.A month on from Trump announcing a \"framework for a future deal\" over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were \"willing to make a lot of accommodations\".",

    "body": "1 day agoOttilie MitchellReutersVenezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez at Miraflores Palace in CaracasA total of 1,557 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty under a new law introduced on Thursday, the country's National Assembly President has said. Jorge Rodríguez, brother of Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez and an ally of former President Nicolás Maduro, also said \"hundreds\" of prisoners had  already been released. Among them is politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of several opposition voices to have criticised the law for excluding certain prisoners.The US has urged Venezuela to speed up its release of political prisoners since US forces seized Maduro in a raid on 3 January. Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners.At a news conference on Saturday Jorge Rodríguez said 1,557 release requests were being addressed \"immediately\" and ultimately the legislation would extend to 11,000 prisoners.The government first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics for years. These groups have also criticised the new law. One frequently cited criticism is that it would not extend amnesty to those who called for foreign armed intervention in Venezuela, BBC Latin America specialist Luis Fajardo says.He noted that law professor Juan Carlos Apitz, of the Central University of Venezuela, told CNN Español that that part of the amnesty law \"has a name and surname\". \"That paragraph is the Maria Corina Machado paragraph.\" It is not clear if the amnesty would actually cover Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, Fajardo said.He added that other controversial aspects of the law include the apparent exclusion from amnesty benefits of dozens of military officers involved in rebellions against the Maduro administration over the years.On Saturday, Rodríguez said it is \"releases from Zona Seven of El Helicoide that they're handling first\". Those jailed at the infamous prison in Caracas would be released \"over the next few hours\", he added.Activists say some family members of those imprisoned in the facility have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their relatives.Maduro is awaiting trial in custody in the US alongside his wife Cilia Flores and has pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapons charges, saying that he is a \"prisoner of war\".",

He was then taken into custody alongside his bodyguard - neither man has commented on the charges.Appearing in court, dressed in black, Mugabe looked calm during the proceedings.Bellarmine is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.Searching the property in Hyde Park where the shooting happened, police have found bullet cartridges but no firearm so far.Mugabe and Tobias Tamirepi Matonhodze, 33, also face additional charges, including defeating the ends of justice, which relates to the missing firearm, prosecutors say.The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition.Speaking outside court, Mugabe's lawyer Sinenhlanhla Mnguni provided an update on his well-being, telling reporters his client was \"fine\" as he remains in custody. Describing the circumstances of the shooting, prosecutors allege that \"an altercation occurred between the victim and the accused inside Mugabe's home\".While attempting to flee the victim was then allegedly \"shot in the back and collapsed outside the gate\" and the gate was then closed, according to a statement from the National Prosecuting Authority.The case against Mugabe and Matonhodze was postponed until 3 March when a bail application will be made.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoOttilie MitchellandYama Bariz,BBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed at least 18 people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school. The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces and had killed dozens of people.In Girdi Kas village, in the Bihsud district of Nangarhar, a man named Shahabuddin told reporters while pointing at his destroyed house that of 23 members of his family, only five had survived the attack. Local Taliban spokesman Sayed Taib Hamd said that 18 members of the family had been killed.The BBC had earlier been told about 20 people were thought to have died. No deaths have been reported so far in the other areas hit. A guesthouse and a religious school were targeted in the Bermal and Urgun districts of Paktika province, but they were empty at the time of the attacks, local officials and locals told the BBC.AFP via Getty ImagesHouses were also destroyed in Balish village in the Urgun district of Paktika province (pictured)Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is eighth in line to the throneAustralia's prime minister has told Sir Keir Starmer his government would back plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.Anthony Albanese expressed his support for such a proposal in a letter to the UK prime minister.Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", in October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The UK government is considering introducing legislation to remove him from the line of succession. It follows Andrew's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The former prince was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest by Thames Valley Police.Removing Andrew from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where King Charles III, his brother, is head of state, including Australia.Albanese's letter reads: \"Dear Prime Minister Starmer, in light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession.\"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation.\"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\"Speaking after his brother Andrew's arrest, King Charles had said: \"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"A spokesman for the UK prime minister confirmed the letter had been received and said the government was \"considering whether further steps are required in relation to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\". He said they were \"not ruling anything out\".\"Given the ongoing police investigation it would not be appropriate for the government to comment further at this stage.\"Removing Andrew from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament approved by MPs and peers, and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.Canada, Jamaica and New Zealand are among the Commonwealth countries who would also need to support it.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Getty ImagesAnthony Albenese wrote to his UK counterpart on MondayBuckingham Palace has not publicly commented on the government's consideration of legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession.On Friday, Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC that the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray meanwhile said \"any questions in that sphere would be quite complicated\", adding that the live police investigation needed to \"play out\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said on Monday that Parliament should not pass legislation to remove the former prince from the line of succession \"until the police have finished their jobs\". He also cautioned against a \"trial by media\".The former prince was arrested at 08:00 GMT on Thursday at Sandringham, the King's Norfolk estate where Andrew has been living since leaving his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, in early February.Police searches at Sandringham concluded late on Thursday. It is understood they continued at the 30-room property in Windsor over the weekend, where several unmarked police cars were seen on Saturday.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of millions of files in January connected to the late financier's case.",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un re-appointed leader of North Korea's ruling party9 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesKim Jong Un vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living in his opening speech to the congressNorth Korea's ruling Workers' Party has again chosen Kim Jong Un to be its general secretary, state media report.The announcement, which was made at a rubber-stamp party congress in Pyongyang on Sunday, comes as little surprise given the Kim family has ruled by dictatorship since the late 1940s.State-run KCNA said that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles. But the secrecy of the regime makes it harder to evaluate how much progress the military has made.  Kim, who took control of the regime after his father's death in 2011, has invested heavily in the nuclear weapons programme, turning Pyongyang into a far bigger challenge for the West, and especially the US.  He is expected to announce the next phase of the country's weapons programme during the Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, which began on 19 February and is now in its fourth day. Before it started, North Korea unveiled what it said was a range of nuclear-capable rocket launchers.The congress has been held once every five years in the last decade.With some 5,000 party members in attendance, according to KCNA, it offers a rare glimpse into the structure of political power in North Korea, which remains quite opaque to even the keenest watchers.The meetings are considered to be the most important political event and provide insight into where the country's priorities lie, from foreign policy to its nuclear ambitions.While Kim has remained at the top of North Korean leadership, the party congress' presidium, or executive committee, has been reshuffled since the last meeting in 2021. More than half of its 39 members have been replaced, according to state media.In his opening speech last week, Kim vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living, which he described as \"heavy and urgent historic tasks\".All eyes are on whether Kim's daughter, Ju Ae, will make an appearance at the congress.Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said that Kim had chosen Ju Ae as his heir. Believed to be 13 years old, she has become an increasingly prominent figure at official events, inspecting missiles and attending Beijing's military parade with her father.Chinese president Xi Jinping called Kim to congratulate him on his re-appointment on Monday, saying he would work with Kim to \"write a new chapter in the China-North Korea friendship\", Chinese state media reported.Beijing has long been Pyongyang's most significant ally: it is North Korea's largest trade partner and source of aid. But at the same time, China is wary of Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, which could destabilise the region, and its growing ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia.",

    "body": "2 days agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentAmmar Awad via ReutersThe mother of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, 19, grieves at his funeral on ThursdayThe family of a 19-year-old Palestinian-American man who they say was shot dead by an Israeli settler in the occupied West Bank have called for accountability over his killing.Nasrallah Abu Siyam was shot near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, becoming at least the sixth American citizen killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the territory in the last two years. The Trump administration said it stood ready to provide consular assistance, but did not respond to claims its policies had failed to stem a surge in settler violence.The Israeli embassy in Washington said the incident was under review and an \"operational inquiry... must be completed as soon as possible\".Abu Siyam was a US citizen born in Philadelphia.His family said he was among approximately 30 residents of the village of Mukhmas who were trying to stop armed settlers from stealing their goats on Wednesday. As both residents and settlers threw stones, said one witness, settlers shot at least three of the villagers, including Abu Siyam, who was struck fatally. Abdulhamid Siyam, cousin to Abu Siyam, told the BBC that the 19-year-old's death was a \"big loss\" and the actions of settlers in the West Bank had gone unchecked.\"A young man of 19 shot and killed in this cold blood and no responsibility, impunity completely,\" he said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from rights groups for lifting Biden-era sanctions on violent settlers, who have rarely faced criminal punishments from Israeli authorities. The US State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was \"carefully monitoring the situation\". On Saturday it released an updated statement saying it extends \"deepest condolences\" to the family of the victim and expects \"a full, thorough, and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death\". It added the US embassy in Jerusalem had been in direct contact with the family to provide assistance.A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that soldiers had attended the scene and used \"riot dispersal means to restore order\". \"No IDF fire  was reported during the course of the incident,\" the IDF statement said. The spokesperson confirmed that the incident was under review, and said \"a continuous military presence\" would remain in the area in the coming days to prevent further incidents.",

The devices were planted in waste bins, it added.President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed \"an individual suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack\" had been detained. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said she was a Ukrainian woman.The police later said the 33-year-old suspect had made and planted the explosives on the \"instruction\" of an agent of Russia's special services.The victim of the attack was named as Viktoria Shpylka. \"She was only 23 years old and had begun her service at the start of the full-scale invasion of the Kherson region,\" the police wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.National Police of UkrainePolice officer Viktoria Shpylka was killed in the attackPolice said the first blast occurred after a police car arrived at the scene of the reported break-in at a shop in the city centre.\"Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off,\" it added.Eleven people were admitted to hospital, six of whom were law enforcement officers in serious conditions.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said police and the Security Service of Ukraine had detained the suspect, a resident of the north-western Rivne region.\"We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime,\" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, the regional prosecutor's office said it had started an investigation into the \"act of terrorism that led to grave consequences\".National Police of Ukraine/TelegramA number of officials were also injured after bombs detonated when they arrived to a reported break-in overnightElsewhere, Ukraine faced another night of overnight Russian strikes ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on Tuesday.Kyiv said its air defences had countered 50 Russian missiles and nearly 300 drones overnight. The attacks targeted the energy sector, residential buildings, and railways, Zelensky said.At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region, top local official Mykola Kalashnyk said, while a woman and a child were taken to hospital with injuries.The latest aerial attack comes two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin has become the biggest war in Europe since World War Two, with hundreds of thousands of military casualties -killed, wounded and missing - believed to be on each side.Western military experts estimate that Russian combat losses have been much higher than Ukraine's.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "Final missing Lake Tahoe skier found dead 5 days after avalanche 2 days agoChristal Hayes and Nardine SaadLos Angeles, California ReutersThe ninth and final missing skier has been found dead in California's Lake Tahoe backcountry, five days after a powerful avalanche struck several guides and a tight-knit group of friends on a trip. Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said on Saturday during a news conference that all nine bodies have now been recovered from the Castle Peak area in the Sierra Nevada mountains. She also released the names of all nine victims, which included close friends, a pair of sisters and three guides. Two people who were part of the group escaped the \"football-field sized\" avalanche - the deadliest in modern California history - and authorities said they might help piece together what happened.Sheriff Moon and others during the news conference described the harsh weather rescue crews were met with after the avalanche, and that white-out conditions stalled days of searching.Authorities said there was an ongoing avalanche risk after the Tuesday disaster and high winds prevented them from being able to utilize helicopters for days.When winds calmed on Friday, helicopters were used to pour water over the area - a tactic meant to mitigate an avalanche risk - authorities said. Crews were then sent to search for the ninth missing skier.The victims were confirmed on Saturday as: Carrie Atkin, 46, of Soda Springs, California; Lizabeth Clabaugh, 52, of Boise, Idaho; Danielle Keatley, 44, of Soda Springs and Larkspur, California; Kate Morse, 45, of Soda Springs and Tiburon, California; Caroline Sekar, 45, of Soda Springs and San Francisco, California; and Katherine Vitt, 43, of Greenbrae, California.The three Blackbird Mountain guides who died were identified as Andrew Alissandratos, 34, of Verdi, Nevada; Nicole Choo, 42, of South Lake Tahoe, California, and Michael Henry, 30, from Soda Springs.Earlier this week, a family spokesperson identified several of the skiers to the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\"While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,\" Moon said at the news conference.She said they relied on avalanche experts, who said the disaster spread across the size of an American football field and was nearly powerful enough to take out a house.Six members of the 15-person backcountry ski group were rescued early this week. The group was on its way back from a three-day guided ski trip in the backcountry when the avalanche struck, bringing with it eight feet (2.4 meters) of snow and 90 mph winds.Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown on Thursday told CBS that when the avalanche hit, the skiers went into what he called \"frantic mode\" to try to find their friends and partners.\"They were ultimately able to unbury three individuals who did not survive,\" Brown said.The Nevada County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that authorities are investigating whether there could be criminal negligence relating to the avalanche, CBS reported.",

Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

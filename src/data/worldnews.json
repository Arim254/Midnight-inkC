    "body": "20 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAMost of the victims were young and relatives are still struggling to comprehendThe Swiss government has announced an emergency payout of 50,000 francs ($65,000;  £48,000) for the victims of the deadly fire at the ski bar resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve.The so-called solidarity contribution will go to each of the 115 injured and the families of the 41 who died, the Federal Council said. Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire at Le Constellation bar began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foam that lined the ceiling of the bar's basement, which was packed with people.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and 58 people are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.The announcement of the payout was made by Swiss President Guy Parmelin and Finance Minister Beat Jans.They said the one-off sum would be in addition to the emergency aid of 10,000 francs offered by the regional government of the canton of Valais where Carns-Montana is situated and \"intended to offer rapid, un-bureaucratic assistance to those affected\". The federal government is also pledging to provide funding of up to 20m francs in addition to facilitating talks between the victims, officials and insurers to reach amicable compensation agreements, Jans said. \"The Federal Council shares with the victims and their families the desire for truth and justice,\" Parmelin told a press conference. \"We, too, want to know what happened, why, and how it could have been prevented.\"Local authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Criminal proceedings have also been brought against the municipality's head of public safety and a former council fire safety inspector.",

    "body": "Australian PM apologises after calling child sex abuse survivor and advocate 'difficult'8 hours agoLana LamSydneyGettyGrace Tame says Anthony Albanese used \"misogynist's code\" in calling her \"difficult\"Australia's prime minister has apologised for calling a former Australian of the Year and sexual abuse survivor \"difficult\", saying it was only in reference to the hardships she has faced.During a one-word response game, Anthony Albanese used the adjective to describe Grace Tame, who was named the 2021 Australian of the Year for her advocacy for child sexual abuse survivors.Tame, 31, said the description was \"misogynist's code for a woman who won't comply. History tends to call her 'courageous'.\"It prompted Albanese to apologise \"if there was any misinterpretation\" and that Tame \"has had a very difficult life, but she deserves great credit for turning that into a benefit for others\".But hours later, Tame dismissed Albanese's apology, taking to Instagram to post: \"Spare me the condescension, old man. We all know what you meant.\"Greens leader Larissa Waters posted on X that calling Tame difficult was \"completely unwarranted\".\"Labelling women as difficult won't silence us. It won't stop us speaking truth to power. Next time try 'unbreakable' or 'warrior' or 'fierce', Prime Minister,\" she wrote. On Wednesday, other answers that Albanese gave during the rapid-response quiz included \"president\" for Donald Trump, , \"leader\" for the new head of the opposition coalition Angus Taylor and \"divisive\" for Pauline Hanson, leader of anti-immigration party One Nation. When asked for a response to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, he said \"grub\" which drew applause from the audience.Tame was awarded Australian of the Year in recognition of her tireless efforts to overturn laws in the state of Tasmania that made it illegal for victims of sexual abuse to speak publicly about their experiences. From the age of 15, Tame was groomed and raped by her 58-year-old maths teacher Nicolaas Ockert Bester. He was later found guilty and served one year and nine months in jail for sexually abusing Tame when she was his student in 2011. In 2022, videos and images of Tame refusing to smile at an official event with the then-prime minister Scott Morrison went viral.She had been openly critical about Morrison over his government's response to sexual assault allegations and a toxic workplace culture in parliament in the wake of  political staffer Brittany Higgins' allegation that she was raped in her boss's office in 2019.The phrase is currently under consideration to be banned as part of new laws cracking down on \"hateful\" slogans after the Bondi Beach shootings. The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.",

    "body": "17 hours agoFiona Nimoni,in LondonandIone Wells,in São Paulo, BrazilAPMarielle Franco was 38 years old when she was shot dead Brazil's Supreme Court has voted to convict two politicians of ordering the murder of the prominent Rio de Janeiro councillor and activist, Marielle Franco. Brothers Domingos Inácio Brazão and João Francisco Inácio Brazão were sentenced to more than 76 years each for masterminding the drive-by shooting that killed Franco alongside her driver Anderson Gomes in 2018. Franco, a gay black woman, was an emerging figure in Brazil's socialist party, with her death at the age of 38 sparking nationwide protests.Four justices concluded unanimously that the Brazão brothers targeted Franco because she was considered a threat to their interests.Franco had worked with Rio de Janeiro's city council to oppose housing developments in poorer neighbourhoods that were a source of income for militia groups.The case exposed links between politicians and organised crime.The brothers \"didn't just have contact with the militia. They were the militia,\" Judge Alexandre de Moraes said.The only woman on the Supreme Court, Carmen Lucia, said the process had caused her \"great spiritual and psychological harm\", asking how many more \"Marielles will Brazil allow to be murdered?\"In a post on Instagram, Franco's sister Anielle Franco - who serves as minister for racial equality - paid tribute to Brazil's judicial system, saying it had \"honoured the memory of Marielle and Anderson\". She added: \"It has been eight years of struggle to find out who ordered Marielle's murder and why. Eight years of fighting for full justice. \"Brazil begins a new historic chapter in confronting political violence based on gender and race. Impunity cannot be part of our democracy.\"In 2024, two former police officers were jailed in 2024 over Marielle's murder. Ronnie Lessa confessed to firing the shots and was sentenced to 78 years and nine months, while Élcio de Queiroz received 59 years and eight months for being behind the wheel.The Brazao brothers were arrested in 2024 after Lessa named them as the masterminds behind the murders as part of a plea deal with prosecutors.Getty ImagesAnielle Franco, pictured with her father and mother, was in the Supreme Court on Wednesday to hear the verdict ",

    "body": "11 hours agoKelly NgAFP via Getty ImagesTommy Schaefer and his then-girlfriend Heather Mack were jailed for the shocking murder of Mack's mother Indonesia has deported a US man who spent 11 years in jail for the high-profile \"suitcase murder\" of his girlfriend's mother on the resort island of Bali. In 2014, Tommy Schaefer was on holiday in Bali with his then-girlfriend Heather Mack and her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack. The couple conspired to kill Wiese-Mack, reportedly to gain access to a $1.5m (£1.17m) trust fund.Her body was later discovered stuffed inside a suitcase. Schaefer was released from a Bali jail on Tuesday morning after receiving a number of remissions for good behaviour. But the 33-year-old will still face federal charges in the US and is due to appear before the court in Chicago on Thursday, according to reports.Shortly before boarding his flight back to the US on Tuesday night, Schaefer apologised for his actions. \"I'm sorry. I'm always sorry. I'm always sorry,\" Schaefer told AFP news agency.\"I was thrust into this situation, but I take full responsibility for everything I have done and I hope Sheila's family finds peace.\"In 2015, an Indonesia court sentenced Schaefer to 18 years in jail and Mack to 10 years, for what the presiding judge called a \"sadistic\" killing.Prosecutors had said that Mack - who was 18 at the time of the murder and pregnant - covered her mother's mouth while Schaefer struck her in the head with a fruit bowl. The body was stuffed inside a suitcase and left it in the boot of a taxi, prosecutors said. The driver later alerted police.The couple was later discovered staying at another hotel in Bali.Schaefer, then 21, said on trial that he had been defending himself after Wiese-Mack became angry after learning that her daughter was pregnant. Mack was given a shorter sentence due to her lesser role and because she gave birth to a baby while on trial, the Bali court heard. She too was released early and deported in 2021. She was arrested immediately upon arriving in the US and charged with conspiracy to kill a US national and obstruction of justice - and eventually sentenced to 26 years in jail. Mack originally pleaded not guilty to the US charges on conspiring to kill a US national, but changed her plea after the prosecutors offered to ask for a shorter sentence.Mack has given media interviews over the years from prison, where she recounted the incident and her troubled relationship with her mother.",

    "body": "Spain declassifies files on 1981 attempted coup in effort to dispel conspiracy theories17 hours agoGuy Hedgecoe,BBC Madrid correspondentandRobert Greenall,BBC NewsGetty ImagesCoup leader Antonio Tejero Molina died on the very same day as the files were declassified.Spain's government has released dozens of documents related to an attempted coup that took place 45 years ago - regarded as a key moment in the country's history.A group of armed officers burst into parliament and threatened MPs, aiming to overthrow the country's fledgling democracy and return it to dictatorship. Their efforts failed when King Juan Carlos refused to support them. However, conspiracy theories have abounded since, including that the king may have had prior knowledge of the coup or even that he may have been actively involved. The release of the files also came on the same day as the death of the coup's leader, Antonio Tejero Molina, at the age of 93. Tejero's lawyer described him as a \"man of honour, unwavering faith, and great love for Spain\".\"May God grant him the peace that men denied him,\" he wrote on X on behalf of his family.On 23 February 1981, a group of officers led by Tejero burst into the main chamber of the national parliament, wielding guns and threatening the politicians as a new government was being sworn in. Their aim was to return authoritarianism - six years after the death of the country's dictator Francisco Franco.A photo of Tejero brandishing a handgun in the parliament as MPs take cover is perhaps the most famous image of the coup.Getty ImagesKing Juan Carlos ascended the throne two days after the death of Gen Francisco FrancoThe release of the 153 classified files generated enormous expectation - so much so that the government web page where the documents were to be posted collapsed temporarily. They include police and judicial reports, transcriptions of conversations between officials, and the reactions of foreign governments to the events.But the files themselves appear to contain no explosive revelations. Franco - Spain's brutal dictator - died in 1975, paving the way for the introduction of a parliamentary monarchy.Six years later, Spain's fragile democracy appeared to hang in the balance for several hours as the coup attempt took place. Eventually, it failed, after the young king addressed Spaniards - and the armed forces - via a televised message, expressing his opposition to the rebels and ordering all military to remain in their barracks.For many Spaniards, the episode sealed Juan Carlos's status as the saviour of their young democracy and the country's rejection of Francoist values.However, in the decades since, many have cast doubt over the supposedly heroic role of the king. Other theories claimed the uprising was a set-up by the political establishment aimed at providing a test that would reinforce the country's democracy.The current, Socialist-led government of Pedro Sánchez said having documents related to this event under lock and key was an \"historical anomaly\" that needed to be corrected and that their release posed no risk to anyone. It also said their declassification would serve to undermine those peddling false theories about the coup.However, there were some interesting revelations in the files, including that six members of the intelligence services were involved in the plot. Another document showed the security forces estimated that, if a police special unit attempted to break into the parliament building, it might lead to \"between 80 and 110 deaths\".Among the documents were also messages of support from foreign governments once the coup had failed. A message in Spanish from Queen Elizabeth II to King Juan Carlos read: \"All of us in Great Britain are reassured to know the final result.\"",

    "body": "'People are getting poorer': How Iran's struggling economy is changing how families live59 minutes agoBehrang Tajdin,Economics correspondent, BBC PersianandGhoncheh Habibiazad,Senior reporter, BBC PersianEPAFood prices have doubled in Iran in the past 12 months, official figures show\"We used to eat out twice a month,\" says Marjan, who lives in Iran's second largest city, Isfahan. \"Now we just can't. We have to save that money to pay the rent.\"For the last six years, she had been selling wooden crafts and keyrings through a page on Instagram - one of hundreds of thousands of Iranian women making a living that way.When the government imposed an internet blackout in early January as part of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests, these women suddenly found themselves with no income.\"Even once the internet came back, things just weren't the same.\" says Marjan. \"Our sales used to be 300 million rials (around $185 on the open market) per month. Now it's not even 30 million rials.\"She and her husband are seriously considering selling their car to pay back their loans and keep up with the rent. \"If things carry on like this, I'll probably have to look for a new job,\" she says. \"The problem is that pretty much every line of work is struggling at the moment, so even that is not a realistic plan B.\"The protests began as a reaction to the spiralling cost of living and soon focused on the whole regime, whose policies people blamed for their difficulties.  The economic situation has worsened in the weeks since the protests erupted.'Just incomprehensible'Affording the basic necessities of life is becoming an increasing struggle for many Iranians because of high inflation.\"Just two months ago, beef was 7m rials per kilo,\" says Mina, a 44-year-old mother of two in Tehran. \"But I bought some the day before yesterday for 19m rials a kilo - more than double. I bought Iranian rice in the late summer for 1.7m rials a kilo, now it's 3.8m.\"The official figures show that in the past 12 months, the price of basic necessities has increased by an average 60%, while food prices have doubled in the same period.And it is not just the last year. The cost of an average family food basket is currently eight times what it was five years ago and more than 30 times what it was in 2016.\"Inflation has basically become a monthly part of our lives now,\" says Amir, a 29-year-old English teacher in Karaj, 30km (20 miles) west of Tehran. \"Prices go up easily by 10% a month\".Back in the spring, he says, \"a hamburger cost 5m rials. It is now 12m. The numbers are just incomprehensible\".These soaring food prices is why you hear more and more Iranians talking about red meat vanishing from their tables in recent years, to be replaced by cheaper alternatives such as chicken, cheese or beans.Figures released by the Central Bank of Iran shows that annual consumption of beef and lamb per household has declined from 64kg in 2004/05 to 32kg in 2024/25.The inflation is forcing families to cut back.Mina says that her family has stopped buying branded goods and that they have not been on a foreign holiday since 2017.\"I can't afford to travel abroad at all. I checked a domestic trip yesterday, 200m rials per person. So for our family of four, that's 800m just for plane tickets. Back in 2017, a whole trip to Europe cost 200m.\"One of the main drivers of these soaring costs has been the rapid fall in the value of the rial.Since May 2018, when Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran and reinstated wide-ranging sanctions on the country, the Iranian currency has lost more than 95% of its value against the US dollar on the open market.The past year has been particularly turbulent.The rapid fall in the value of the rial sparked the protests in Tehran's bazaar in late December, which soon spread across the country. The protests were brutally suppressed by the security forces, who killed thousands of people.Since then, the rial's value has kept falling, pushing up the prices even higher.Those with fixed incomes can see how this has eroded their purchasing power.Worse every yearSima, a former senior civil servant who has recently retired, says her income is now six times what it was a decade ago, but in dollars, it is worth several times less.\"In 2015, my salary of 50m rials a month was roughly worth $1,500. By 2020, it had risen to 130m rials and was worth around $520. Now my pension is about 300m and worth less than $200,\" says the 60-year-old Tehran resident.\"Ten years ago, I used to change my mobile phone every two years, sometimes even once a year,\" she says. \"I could easily afford a brand-new imported car back then. Now, we can't even upgrade to a slightly better second-hand one, let alone buy new.\"The gradual fall in living standards has been the story of the past two decades.BBC Persian analysis of the official data shows that over the past 20 years, the average annual household expenditure in real terms has fallen by a quarter in urban areas and has almost halved in rural areas.In other words, Iranians are on average much poorer than they were 20 years ago.This is despite the fact that from 1990 to mid-2000s this measure was on an upward trajectory.However, the sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear programme created a toxic combination of persistently high levels of inflation, low employment, and low or no real GDP growth, has resulted in Iranian families seeing their living standards fall. And events of the last 12 months have severely worsened the situation.Shadow of warSince the 12-day war between Iran and Israel last June, during which the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities, the Iranian economy has remained in a state of suspense, and many think that it is not a question of \"if\" but \"when\" hostilities will flare up again.The resumption of talks on a new deal between Iran and the US in February, with Trump threatening military action if the Iranian government does not agree to his demands, has not helped the business sentiment much either.\"Investors are not thinking of expansion or creating jobs. They are only thinking of saving their business,\" says a spokesman for Iran's private sector.Farshid Shokrekhodaei, head of investment and financing at the Iran Chamber of Commerce told Ilna news agency that because of these conditions \"the capital is going towards investing in assets such as foreign currency and gold\", instead of investing in productive businesses.This is in addition to other crises that had been adversely affecting businesses and people.Iran is facing a serious shortage of electricity, natural gas and water, as a result of years of underinvestment in infrastructure and the government's failure to manage consumption.Every winter, factories have their gas supply cut off for days, even weeks, at a time.  In the warmer months, their electricity is cut off. People also have to endure regular blackouts at home, as well as their drinking water supply being shut off in larger cities.But all those problems are overshadowed by the \"not war, not peace\" situation - as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei put it - between Iran and the US.Many people, like Parham, a 26-year-old from Tehran, do not think that it can \"continue for much longer - not for us, nor for the US.\"\"Given that people are getting poorer and poorer, we're going to see a wave of social instability,\" he says.",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaGetty ImagesChimamanda Ngozi Adichie had twin boys, via a surrogate, in 2024An inquest into the death of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son will formally begin on 14 April.The date was set during a preliminary hearing at the Yaba Magistrate Court in Lagos, roughly seven weeks after Nkanu Nnamdi Esege died at a Euracare hospital.Adiche and her family have accused Euracare of negligence, saying medics denied Nkanu oxygen and gave him too much sedation, causing a cardiac arrest.The hospital expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" over the death but denied wrongdoing, saying its care had been in line with international standards.During the preliminary hearing on Wednesday, Magistrate Atinuke Adetunji directed all parties to file witness statements ahead of the inquest.The court is expected to hear evidence from medical experts and hospital representatives as the coroner seeks to establish the circumstances and cause of Nkanu's death.According to submissions made to the court by Adichie's legal team, Nkanu had initially been admitted to Atlantis Hospital in Lagos with what was described as a worsening but mild illness. Plans had been made to transfer him to the United States for further treatment at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.But first, Atlantis Hospital referred the toddler to Euracare for pre-flight investigations, including an MRI and a spinal tap, or lumbar puncture. He died on 7 January after undergoing these procedures.In a legal notice three days later, lawyers for Adichie and her husband, Dr Ivara Esege, accused Euracare of breaching the duty of care owed to the child. The hospital denied this allegation.Adichie, 48, is an award-winning writer known for a string of internationally successful novels, such as Half of a Yellow Sun and Americanah.She was born and raised in Nigeria but is now based in the US.Adichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Nkanu was one of twin boys born in 2024, using a surrogate.More about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "11 minutes agoPaulin KolaMedinski Instagram postThe peace talks have not produced any results, but prisoners and bodies have been exchangedRussia has handed over the remains of 1,000 soldiers to Ukraine and has received the bodies of 35 Russian soldiers in return, Russia's top negotiator has said.It comes as Ukraine's chief negotiator was preparing to meet US President Donald Trump's envoys in Geneva for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war which has entered its fifth year. Two previous rounds of talks hosted by Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner have included Russian negotiators, too, but have not led to a breakthrough. Hours before the latest talks, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles in six different regions of Ukraine, injuring dozens of people, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelesnky said. Vladimir Medinsky, a top aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, did not give any details about the exchange of bodies in his short announcement on Telegram, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck. Ukraine has not confirmed the exchange.The two sides have, however, exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Kyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.And from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.So even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received. No-one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.One possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.On the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating \"an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level\". \"President Trump supports this sequence of steps,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war.\" Putin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.However, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoHarry SekulichandPaul Kirby,Europe digital editorGetty ImagesHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says he has stationed soldiers at key energy facilities across the country after he blamed Ukraine for disrupting energy supplies.Orban, who is trailing in opinion polls ahead of pivotal elections next month, has accused Kyiv of imposing an \"oil blockade\" on Hungary by deliberately delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline.Ukraine says the pipeline was damaged by Russian strikes last month and its repair crews have been injured by further attacks.Druzhba is the main route for delivering Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia and shipments of Russian oil to both countries have been cut off since 27 January.The Hungarian leader, who is seen as Russia's closest partner in the EU, argues the suspension of the critical oil flow is purely political and has accused Ukraine of \"preparing further actions\", including sabotage, four years into Russia's full-scale war.However, Orban's critics say he has been stepping up the war of words with Ukraine in order to convince the public that Hungary is under attack in the run-up to the 12 April vote. Most opinion polls suggest his Fidesz party is at risk of losing power after 16 years.This week he vetoed a €90bn (£78bn) EU loan to Ukraine and blocked the 20th package of sanctions on Moscow.In an open letter on social media on Thursday, he accused Ukraine, the EU and opposition parties of \"co-ordinating efforts to bring a pro-Ukraine government to power in Hungary\".The EU has urged Kyiv to speed up reopening the pipeline, but Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said \"they advise us to repair it, but they know that there have already been attacks on Druzhba\".Slovakia's leader Robert Fico, also seen as one of Russia's closest European partners, has accused Zelensky of stalling. On Monday, his government said it would stop providing emergency power supplies to Ukraine until oil supplies resumed through the pipeline.Ukraine has had to increase imports from its European neighbours because of acute power shortages throughout the winter caused by intensified Russian attacks on its electricity and gas networks.The European Commission made clear on Wednesday that while Hungary and Slovakia had begun using their emergency oil supplies there was no risk of a shortages and there were alternative sources for both countries.\"Croatia confirmed... that non-Russian crude oil is being transported through the Adria pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia,\" European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said after experts met to discuss the situation. \"It remains the main alternative pipeline for Hungary and Slovakia to cover their needs, and the pipeline has sufficient capacity to increase volumes to fully cover the Hungarian Slovakian requirements,\" she said. Ukraine's military has repeatedly attacked Russian oil facilities inside Russia itself, and a Ukrainian drone strike hit an oil pumping station in Tatarstan earlier this week.The attacks forced Russia's oil operator to reduce the amount of crude oil it takes into its system by about 250,000 barrels a day, according to Reuters news agency.In his message on Thursday, Orban accused Zelensky of blocking the Druzhba pipeline as an \"anti-Hungarian policy\", a day after he accused Kyiv of \"preparing further actions to disrupt Hungary's energy system\".Following a meeting of the Hungarian Defence Council on Wednesday, he said soldiers had been deployed to energy stations, police would patrol power stations, and drones were banned in Hungary's north-east border region with Ukraine.There is no indication that Ukraine is planning any kind of attack, and its armed forces are already severely stretched in a four-year full-scale Russian invasion along a front line of about 1,200km (750 miles).Zelensky did not immediately respond to the accusation, however Orban has long sought to portray Kyiv as trying to drag Hungary into the war, and he has repeatedly tried to block financial aid to Ukraine.",

    "body": "9 hours agoKoh EweandDanny Vincent,Hong KongGetty ImagesJimmy Lai was sentenced to nearly six years in jail in 2022 for a fraud offenceJimmy Lai, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, has won an appeal against a fraud conviction in 2022, which had seen him sentenced to nearly six years in jail. On Thursday, Hong Kong's Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of Lai and another defendant who had been accused of illegally subletting office space.But the 78-year-old will remain in prison. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail for colluding with foreign forces under the city's national security law.Lai, a British citizen, is a fierce critic of Beijing and is one of the biggest figures in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. He has been detained since 2020.Lai's daughter Claire described the ruling on Thursday as \"nothing more than a PR move by the Hong Kong authorities\". \"No one should be fooled into thinking.. [it] is anything more,\" she told the BBC.\"The rule of law is broken there, and my father is still unjustly imprisoned and will remain so for nearly 20 years unless urgent action is taken to secure his release.\"Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, who leads Lai's international legal team, echoed this, saying the decision \"changes nothing\" and that Lai risks dying in prison because of ill health.\"No one should be fooled into thinking that this fraud appeal belatedly succeeding suggests the Hong Kong system operates fairly or justly,\" she told the BBC.In 1995, Lai founded Apple Daily, a local tabloid that was critical of Beijing and became Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper. The paper was shuttered in 2021 after Lai and other key staff members were arrested.The paper was at the heart of Lai's fraud trial. Prosecutors argued that Lai breached lease terms by allowing his private consultancy firm to operate in office space that Apple Daily had rented.Wong Wai-keung, a former executive at Lai's media company, was also charged in the same case and jailed for 21 months.Critics say Lai's trials and detention are a sign of the shrinking civil liberties in Hong Kong, especially after the introduction of a Beijing-imposed national security law.This month, the UK and the US governments said the national security law has been used to \"silence\" activists like Lai.But Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have argued that the law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Rights groups and Lai's family have raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Last December Claire Lai told the BBC that her father's teeth were rotting and his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\".But Chinese authorities maintained that Lai was \"in good health\" and received \"appropriate\" care.Supporters claim that Jimmy Lai has long been facing political persecution through the courts. The overturning of the sentence on Thursday has been met with some scepticism by some.\"Even if [he] is released at 96 rather than 98, it doesn't make much difference,\" one supporter who attended court told the BBC.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Pope Leo to visit four African countries in April18 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesPope Leo visited Africa several times before he became the leader of the Catholic ChurchPope Leo XIV will begin a 10-day visit to four African countries on 13 April, marking his first pastoral trip to the continent, the Vatican has announced.He will travel to Algeria, Cameroon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea.In Cameroon, the Pope will visit the capital Yaoundé, the economic hub Douala, and the Anglophone city of Bamenda in the restive Northwest region, where an armed conflict has been raging for nearly 10 years.This is the first time that a pope will visit Algeria, whose population is mostly Muslim.In December, he expressed his desire to visit the continent, citing Algeria, the birthplace of St Augustine of Hippo, as a potential destination. The pontiff belongs to the Augustinian religious order and had previously called for interfaith dialogue in the North African country.While it will be the Pope's first pastoral visit to Africa since assuming the leadership of the Catholic Church, he is no stranger to the continent. As Cardinal Robert Prevost, he visited several countries including Kenya and Tanzania. His decision to travel to the continent highlights Africa's growing importance to the church - it is home to about 20% of the world's Catholics.In January, Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, Archbishop of Kinshasa and President of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar hinted at the Pope's plans to visit Africa in April.\"When the Pope visits a country, especially countries in crisis like ours, it is also to give hope to the people, especially people who are suffering,\" the cardinal said in an interview with Vatican News after meeting the pontiff.The Pope's visit to Africa follows his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon late last year, where he called for peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.The last papal trip to Africa took place in February 2023, when Leo's predecessor, Pope Francis, visited the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.The official programme of the Pope's activities during his tour is yet to be released.However, Vatican News reports that the tour from April 13 to 23, will include stops in Algiers and Annaba in Algeria; Yaoundé, Bamenda and Douala in Cameroon; Luanda, Muxima and Saurimo in Angola; and Malabo, Mongomo and Bata in Equatorial Guinea, the continent's only Spanish‑speaking nation.Additional reporting by Jean OtalorMore about Pope Leo XIV from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "45 minutes agoVanessa Buschschlüter,Latin America online editor,Bernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporter,andMax MatzaWatch: \"I'm not going to speculate\", says Marco Rubio on Cuba boat shootingCuba has accused 10 people aboard a US-registered speedboat it intercepted off its coast on Wednesday of planning \"an infiltration with terrorist aims\".Border guards shot dead four people and injured the other six on the boat, the Cuban interior ministry said, alleging that those aboard the Florida-registered vessel had fired first.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.The deadly shooting comes at a time of increased tension between the two countries, less than two months after US forces seized Cuba's close ally, Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, and stopped his successor from supplying it with oil.   Cuba's interior ministry said in an online statement that the speedboat had entered Cuban territorial waters and was \"one nautical mile off Cayo Falcones\", on Cuba's northern coast, when it was intercepted.It added that the commander of the Cuban boat was injured in the firefight that ensued.Cuban officials have so far named one of the men killed in the clash, as well as the six survivors, who they said were evacuated and given medical assistance. The Cuban authorities said they had established that all 10 of those on board the speedboat were Cuban nationals residing in the US. They also identified an 11th person they said had been arrested and had confessed to being part of the alleged plot.The Cuban authorities added that most of them had \"prior records involving criminal and violent activity\".Handguns, assault rifles and improvised explosive devices were recovered from the speedboat, along with other tactical gear, according to the statement.BBC Verify checked the speedboat's registration details provided by the Cuban embassy in US (FL7726SH, Florida registered) but they yielded no ownership details or tracking history on any of the platforms the BBC relies on.Cuba's interior ministry has in the past denounced other incursions into its territorial waters by privately owned US boats it said were engaged in smuggling Cubans from the Caribbean island to the US. The incident also comes almost 30 years to the day since Cuban defence forces shot down two small civilian planes belonging to Brothers to the Rescue, a US-based group that searched for rafts carrying migrants from Cuba to the US. Four people aboard were killed in the 1996 incident, triggering outrage in the US.Before the Cuban government released some of the passengers' identities, Rubio had said that the speedboat intercepted by the Cubans had not been carrying US government personnel.The US secretary of state said Washington would not rely on information provided by the Cuban government, and would instead independently verify the facts of the case and what those on board were doing in the area.He spoke from Saint Kitts and Nevis, where he had travelled to meet Caribbean leaders amid the Trump administration's push to ramp up pressure on Cuba's government, as well as other regional issues. Rubio, whose parents emigrated to the US from Cuba in the 1950s, has been a harsh critic of the Communist-run government in Havana. He said on Wednesday that \"Cuba's status quo is unacceptable\" and \"needs to change\".\"They need to make dramatic reforms,\" he said, urging its Communist leadership to \"open the space for both economic, and eventually political, freedom for the people of Cuba\".Last month, following the seizure of Venezuela's Maduro in a US military operation, Donald Trump told Cuba to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.The US president also said at the time that there would be \"no more oil going to Cuba\". His administration has blocked shipments from Venezuela and threatened tariffs on other nations delivering oil to the island.The move has further exacerbated the already crippling oil and fuel shortages Cuba has been suffering for years.On Wednesday, however, the US Treasury said it would ease some small private sector transactions, including oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people, for commercial and humanitarian use\".The first Cuban interior ministry statement alluded to these tensions, saying that \"in the face of current challenges, Cuba reaffirms its determination to protect it territorial waters\" and safeguard its sovereignty.

    "body": "21 hours agoShingai NyokaHarareGetty ImagesThe US funding would have gone towards supporting programmes for HIV/Aids treatment and prevention, tuberculosis and malariaZimbabwe has rejected a US health deal that would have provided $367m (£272m) in funding over five years because of Washington's demand for sensitive data.The decision has come to light after a government memo from December was leaked, revealing that President Emmerson Mnangagwa felt the deal was \"lopsided\".A government spokesman has since explained the US was demanding access to biological samples for research and commercial gain but said it was not willing to share the benefits for future vaccines and treatments.\"We will now turn to the difficult and regrettable task of winding down our health assistance in Zimbabwe,\" US ambassador to Zimbabwe Pamela Tremont said in a statement.Her embassy said the US had provided more than $1.9bn in health funding to Zimbabwe over the last two decades.A doctors' association in Zimbabwe has called for further dialogue to find a deal acceptable to both sides so the country's HIV programme can continue.The agency had administered aid for the US government, but Trump argued its spending was \"wasteful\" and his administration was pursing government-to-government deals to boost transparency and accountability.It said the money for Zimbabwe would have gone towards \"HIV/Aids treatment and prevention, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal and child health, and disease outbreak preparedness\".\"We believe this collaboration would have delivered extraordinary benefits for Zimbabwean communities especially the 1.2 million men, women and children currently receiving HIV treatment through US-supported programmes,\" Tremont said.But government spokesperson Nick Mangwana said the arrangement was \"asymmetrical\".\"Zimbabwe was being asked to share its biological resources and data over an extended period, with no corresponding guarantee of access to any medical innovations - such as vaccines, diagnostics, or treatments - that might result from that shared data,\" his statement said.\"In essence, our nation would provide the raw materials for scientific discovery without any assurance that the end products would be accessible to our people should a future health crisis emerge.\"He also said the US's withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) and its pursuit of bilateral health agreements were upending structures already set up through the global health agency.Mangwana gave as an example its Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing scheme to deal with future pandemics.\"This system is designed to ensure that when a country contributes its data, the benefits - including vaccines and treatments - are shared equitably, not commercialised exclusively by those with the resources to develop them.\"Zimbabwe's reservations over the US deal \"should not be misconstrued as anti-American sentiment\", he added.\"We welcome continued dialogue with our American counterparts on how future co-operation might be structured in a manner that respects the sovereignty and dignity of both nations.\"The Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians (ZCPHP) said it understood the government's concerns, but suggested negotiations should continue given that much of the country's HIV programmes relied on external financing.\"Where technical issues exist, including those relating to data governance or implementation frameworks, these can often be addressed through technical clarification and negotiated safeguards,\" it said.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

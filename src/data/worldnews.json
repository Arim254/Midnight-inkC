    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge4 days agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, all those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based international order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret3 days agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Top image credit: PA MediaEmail: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "14 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesA former French senator has been found guilty of spiking an MP's drink with ecstasy in order to sexually assault her.Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars.He was also ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,350) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her.Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said the sentence was a \"huge relief\". Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal. According to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass.\"I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor,\" she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. \"He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down.\"Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA.Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said.\"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\"He added: \"We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough... All I want is to speak out on the dangers of these products.\"Getty ImagesSandrine Josso remains an MP for the centre-right MoDem partyAsked about the several internet searches he made around ecstasy and the drug GHB, he said he had no recollection.\"I was on the train, thoughts and ideas just come to you,\" he told the court, adding government members needed to show an interest in \"all current events\".Guerriau, a centre-right senator from the Horizons party, was suspended when the charges against him came to light. He resigned as a senator last October.Josso, who is still an MP for the centre-right MoDem, has become a staunch campaigner against so-called chemical submission - drug-facilitated sexual assault.\"What I went through is still very painful,\" Josso said, speaking to French media ahead of the trial beginning. \"Psychological trauma feels like being frozen in time... I jump at the slightest thing. I've become very vulnerable.\"Josso has gone on to join an association against chemical submission, set up by Caroline Darian - the daughter of Dominique Pelicot, who in 2024 was found guilty of drugging his wife Gisele and inviting men to rape her in their home for over a decade.Josso was often in court during the Pelicot trial. This week, Darian and her brother David attended the proceedings in the Guerriau case.",

    "body": "49 minutes agoHarry SekulichReutersTrump claims Iraq would have \"zero chance\" of succeeding under former PM Nouri MalikiA former Iraqi prime minister has denounced threats made by US President Donald Trump to end US support for Iraq if he were to return to power.Nouri Maliki, who has links to Iran, was selected at the weekend by the ruling coalition of Shia-led parties as its nominee for prime minister.The US president wrote on Truth Social that Maliki would be a \"very bad choice\", adding: \"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos.\" Maliki, whose time in office between 2006 and 2014 was marked by sectarian violence, stepped down after the Islamic State (IS) group seized large parts of the country.In a post on X, Maliki rejected US interference in Iraq's internal affairs and said he considered the comments a \"violation\" of the country's sovereignty and its democratic order.After being endorsed on Saturday by a Shia Co-ordination Framework, Maliki would then normally be nominated by the president, who holds a largely ceremonial role.Iraq's parliament was set to elect a president on Tuesday but the vote was delayed after the presidential candidate could not be agreed on.Influential Shia groups in Baghdad have varying links to neighbouring Islamic Republic, which is ruled by a Shia cleric. Washington has voiced concerns about Iranian-linked groups deepening its influence in the region, including Iraq. Trump said the country would have \"zero\" chance of success without US support after vowing to \"no longer help\" the country if Maliki was elected. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed concern about Maliki's links to Iran during a call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani on Sunday, emphasising \"that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq's own interest first\".Trump has frequently bucked precedent by intervening in other countries' elections, backing fellow right-wing candidates in elections in Poland, Romania and Honduras, where the US-backed winner was inaugurated on Tuesday.Earlier this month, the American military seized then-Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in order for him to face trial in New York.Maliki was a divisive figure during his two terms as prime minister. He was Iraq's second prime minister after the US-led invasion in 2003, which led to the overthrow and eventual execution of Saddam Hussein, who had overseen a brutal repression of Shia Muslims and Kurds over three decades.His sectarian approach and alienation of Sunnis and Kurds were blamed by many for precipitating the IS crisis.In 2014, Iraqi security forces under his command collapsed as hundreds of IS fighters seized control of a large part of north-eastern Iraq, including the city of Mosul.Three months later, Maliki was replaced as prime minister after losing the support of key militia and political leaders form his own Shia community and many outside powers, including Iran.",

    "body": "9 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesK-pop band BTS' comeback tour is likely to be one of the biggest tours of the yearThe scramble for tickets to K-pop band BTS' comeback tour, which comes after a four-year hiatus, has seen Mexico's president appealing to her South Korean counterpart to add more shows in her country.\"I wrote a letter to the [president] of Korea... I still haven't received the answer, but let's hope it's positive,\" Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday.BTS will hold three shows in Mexico City in May, as part of its 79-date world tour after a four-year hiatus. Tickets were wiped out in less than 40 minutes, local media reported.Some fans have also accused Ticketmaster and resale platforms of dynamic pricing, prompting an investigation.While on Ticketmaster, the official sales channel, tickets were going for between 1,800 pesos and 17,800 pesos ($100 to $1,030; £76 to £750), resale platforms were offering them for between 11,300 to 92,100 pesos, according to Reuters. Mexico's consumer watchdog has sanctioned resale platforms StubHub and Viagogo for \"abusive and disloyal practices\" over the ticketing process.About a million young people were vying for 150,000 BTS concert tickets, Sheinbaum said on Monday.\"This group, BTS, is very popular among young Mexicans,\" she said.Spotify lists Mexico as K-pop's fifth-largest market worldwide, with streaming of the genre's songs growing more than 500% in the country in the last five years. Sheinbaum wrote to South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung after being told by local concert promoter Ocesa that the band's packed itinerary made adding shows unfeasible.Seoul's presidential office and foreign ministry have declined to comment on the matter, according to South Korean media.BTS has not released music as a group since June 2022, as they took a break to explore individual music careers and later underwent mandatory military service.The septet's globe-spanning comeback tour – likely to be one of the biggest tours of the year – will kick off with three nights in South Korea's Goyang Stadium on 9 April, before travelling across across Asia, Europe and America.According to Billboard, the group and their record label Hybe stand to make more than $1bn (£740m) from the tour, across concerts, merchandise, licensing, album sales and streaming revenue.",

    "body": "Malaysia football officials quit over foreign-born players scandal3 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesFifa launched a probe into seven players on Malaysia's football team after their victory over Vietnam in an Asian Cup qualifierThe entire executive committee of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) have resigned amid a simmering scandal over foreign-born players in the national team.The mass resignations would \"ensure that any necessary reforms may be undertaken without distraction or perceived conflicts, and with a renewed basis of trust\", FAM said in a statement on Wednesday.For days there had been speculation that FAM leaders would step down to prevent a takeover by a FIFA-nominated committee, local media reported.The resignations were meant to \"safeguard the reputation and institutional interests of FAM\" and avoid consequences that \"could affect Malaysian football as a whole\", FAM said.It added that until a new committee is appointed, FAM's operations will be managed by a small team led by its secretary-general with help from the Asian Football Confederation.The seven foreign-born players have been been fined by Fifa, which also temporarily suspended them from playing football.But that suspension was lifted this week by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is set to deliver a verdict on the fates of embattled athletes.What is the scandal about?After Malaysia's 4-0 victory over Vietnam in an Asian Cup qualifier last June, Fifa launched an investigation into the eligibility of seven foreign-born players on the Malaysian national team.They are: Spanish-born Gabriel Felipe Arrocha, Facundo Tomas Garces and Jon Irazabal Iraurgui, Argentinian-born Rodrigo Julian Holgado and Imanol Javier Machuca, Netherlands-born Hector Alejandro Hevel Serrano and Brazilian-born Joao Vitor Brandao Figueiredo.Fifa's \"grandfather rule\" allows foreign-born football players to represent countries that their biological parents or grandparents were born in.The rule aims to prevent national teams from simply importing foreign players to boost performance.But according to Fifa, FAM had forged birth certificates to make it look like the players' grandparents were born in Malaysian cities like Penang and Malacca.Fifa investigators said the grandparents' original birth certificates showed they had been born in countries like Argentina and Spain - all corresponding with the players' birthplaces.This \"constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating\", the football governing body said at the time.The Fifa disciplinary committee fined the players and suspended them for 12 months. It also ordered FAM to pay 350,000 Swiss francs ($440,000; £330,000).FAM said the discrepancies arose from an \"administrative error\" and maintained the players were \"legitimate Malaysian citizens\".But FAM's appeal was rejected by Fifa, which overturned the results of three of Malaysia's football matches - against Singapore, Palestine and Cape Verde - into 3-0 defeats.FIFA also vowed to launch a formal investigation into FAM and inform authorities in five countries of forgery offences.What's next?After losing its appeal against Fifa's decision, FAM took the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an independent body in charge of sports-related disputes.On Monday, the CAS lifted the suspension on the seven players, allowing them to participate in football activities until it issues a verdict on their eligibility.That verdict is expected in late February, a FAM official told local media.This means for now, the players can return to the pitch at their respective football clubs.On Tuesday, Spanish football club Deportivo Alaves announced that Facundo Garces has rejoined the team's training sessions.Photos shared by Malaysian football club Johor Darul Ta'zim also showed another three players - Joao Figueiredo, Hector Hevel Jon Irazabal - back at training.South East Asian countries in search of sporting success have launched recruitment drives for naturalised football players. Indonesia, for one, has welcomed a wave of Dutch-born footballers from the Indonesian diaspora. Since 2018 Malaysia has granted citizenship to 23 foreigners to play for the national team, home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail told parliament last October.",

President Donald Trump has threatened to annex the Danish territory for what he says are national security reasons, though recently walked back comments, saying he was seeking \"immediate negotiations\" and insisting he \"won't use force\". Young is known for his political protests, and has long been a vocal critic of Trump. He announced the offer \"of peace and love\" on his website, where he added that he hoped \"other organisations will follow in the spirit of our example.\" In his statement, signed \"love earth\", Young refers to the Trump administration as \"our unpopular and hopefully temporary government\".Access to Young's digital archive usually starts at around $25 (£18), depending on the subscription package. To secure free access, a Greenland registered mobile phone number will be required for verification.Earlier this month, Young wrote on his website: \"Wake up people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes... He has divided us.\" In 2020 Young took legal action to try to stop Trump using his music at campaign rallies.Young has also called on people to boycott Amazon over owner Jeff Bezos's donations to the Trump campaign and support for the administration. In 2022, he told Spotify to remove hits like Harvest Moon and Heart of Gold, complaining that Rogan was spreading vaccine misinformation on the streaming service. Other artists, including Joni Mitchell and India Arie, also removed their songs in solidarity.The singer said at the time that his return did not reflect a reversal of his stance, but that the decision came after Rogan signed a $250m (£181m) deal to make his podcast available on multiple platforms, rather than remaining a Spotify exclusive.Neil Young was born in Canada but later moved to the US and holds dual citizenship.

    "body": "4 hours agoKelly NgandHosu Lee,SeoulAFPKim Keon Hee was also ordered to return a diamond necklace and pay back 12.85 million wonThe wife of South Korea's ousted former president has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for accepting bribes from the controversial Unification Church.However, the court cleared 52-year-old Kim Keon Hee on charges of stock price manipulation and receiving free opinion polls from a political broker before the 2022 presidential election, which her husband Yoon Suk Yeol won.Yoon has already been sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a former presidential couple are convicted at the same time.On Wednesday, Judge Woo In-sung at the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Kim had \"misused her position as a means of pursuing personal gain\".\"The higher [one's] position, the more consciously one must guard against such conduct... The defendant failed to reject solicitations and was preoccupied with self-adornment,\" the judge said.In a statement after the verdict, Kim said: \"I humbly accept the court's sterm admonition and will not take its weight lightly\". \"Once again, I sincerely apologise to everyone for the concern I have caused,\" she added. Kim had previously denied all charges.A special counsel team appointed to the case said Kim received 80m ($56,000; £40,600) won of gifts, which include a Graff diamond necklace and several Chanel handbags, from the Unification Chruch between April and July 2022, in exchange for business and political favours. The team had sought a 15-year jail term and a fine of 2 billion won for all three charges heard on Wednesday – for which Kim was convicted of one – but the judge noted that Kim was not the one who demanded or solicited the bribes, and that she had \"no significant criminal record\". She was however ordered to pay back 12.85 million won in cash and the court also ordered the confiscation of the diamond necklace.Kim has also been charged over her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit Unification Church followers to the conservative People Power Party that her husband was part of, and accepting gifts in exchange for government job appointments. The court has yet to hear those cases. The former first lady had denied all charges, saying they were \"deeply unjust\", although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she said she later returned without using.She made a public apology when she appeared for questioning last August. \"I am truly sorry that a nobody like me has caused concern to the people,\" she said.Investigations into Kim's dealings with the Unification Church had also led to the arrest of church leader Han Hak-ja. Apart from the criminal allegations, Kim has also been the subject of other controversies. Last year, Sookmyung Women's University annulled an art education degree she graduated with in 1999, after an ethics panel found she had plagiarised her master's thesis.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi in Seoul",

    "body": "1 hour agoKali HaysSan FranciscoEPAUS technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error.The email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to  a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to \"strengthen the company.\"The message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. Early on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to \"remove bureaucracy\" at the firm.Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make \"broad reductions every few months\", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 job cuts in October.\"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now,\" she said.Project DawnOn Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers.The title of the invitation was \"Send project Dawn email,\" an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job cuts.While the email made clear that layoffs were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed.\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the email said.\"Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,\" it added.The 16,000 job cuts had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former employee who asked not be identified.The broad understanding among employees had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, added the former employee, who left the company as part of the cuts in October.The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major round of layoffs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May.While laid-off workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company.Since 2022, major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft and others have slashed their workforces by laying off tens of thousands of people each year.Across the entire tech industry, an estimated 700,000 people have been laid off over the last four years, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts.So far this year, Facebook owner Meta has cut more roles, impacting several hundred employees. As has Pinterest, which this week cut around 700 jobs.'Time to rethink'Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of layoffs in 2023, 2024 and 2025.Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm.In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time.Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the CEO said he was thankful for the \"challenges at opportunities at work\" as \"the world is changing at a very rapid rate.\" Jassy called this era at Amazon \"a time to rethink everything we've ever done.\"Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.Additional reporting by Mitch Labiak",

    "body": "Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate51 minutes agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlinePhoto by Jim Watson - Pool/Getty ImagesICE agents are among the 3,000 officers deployed to the region as part of a crackdown on immigrantsThe government of Ecuador has condemned what it described as an attempt by a US federal immigration agent to enter the Ecuadorean consulate in Minneapolis.The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted \"to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time\", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said. Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint.The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had \"tried to enter the premises of the consulate\" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday.According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located \"shall not enter\" the parts of the consulate used for work \"except with the consent of the head of the consular post\".Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate. While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where \"prompt protective action\" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster.In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent \"this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here\".The agent tells the official that \"if you touch me, I will grab you\". The consular official then states again that \"you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office\", before closing the door. In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had \"immediately\" handed a an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito.The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration. Just over two months ago, the two presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations.The actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good on 7 January -  have triggered protests in the city and beyond. There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region. Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities. According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed \"more than 675,000 illegal aliens\" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

    "body": "7 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said his administration was \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there.\"Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible,\" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.In early January Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed after being stopped by border agents this past weekend. Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota.Speaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as \"a very unfortunate incident\".Asked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump said: \"I haven't heard that.\"  Trump then added: \"He shouldn't have been carrying a gun.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said shortly after the shooting that Pretti \"wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence,\" and accused him of \"domestic terrorism\". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun during a confrontation. Eyewitnesses and local officials, however, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.Local authorities said the gun had been legally registered and that Pretti had been shot after the firearm was removed.A preliminary report drafted by Customs and Border Protection also appears to contradict the initial DHS account of events. It says two of its agents fired their weapons at Pretti.It does not mention that Pretti was reaching for his firearm, according to a copy of the report seen by the BBC's US partner CBS News.On Monday, the DHS pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state. The department said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there.Homan posted on social media on Tuesday that he had met Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials.Pretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region.In the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying \"we took thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state, \"so they have good crime numbers.\"\"That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now,\" he said, before adding the administration would \"de-escalate\".Stephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House \"provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors\".\"We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol,\" Miller said in his statement to CNN.Some Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.\"The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend,\" Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his \"support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Ricketts said he expected \"a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident\".A federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence.In his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "27 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosCheyenne Hangaman says she tried to save her three children by lifting them out of the waterThree young brothers have died in Bonham, north Texas, after falling through ice on a private pond on Monday.Cheyenne Hangaman, the boys' mother, said she tried to rescue them by lifting them out of the water and placing them on the ice, but it kept breaking.\"There was three of them and only one of me... that's why I couldn't save them,\" she told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.She described her sons, aged six, eight and nine, as full of personality and urged families to \"make sure that you hold your kids tight, always tell them that you love them\".This story contains graphic content that some readers may find distressing.Hangaman, a mother of six, first learned of the accident when her daughter ran over to her, shouting that the boys had fallen in.The children had been out playing near the pond, about 100ft (30m) away from the house where the family had been staying. The youngest fell through first after trying to \"ice skate\" on the layer of ice on the water, Hangaman said, adding that the two older boys then jumped in after him.\"When I seen them, they were struggling, and I know their bodies were already in shock,\" she said. \"The water was freezing cold.\"AFPHangaman said she had warned the boys to stay away from the waterWhile trying to save them, she began to struggle and was rescued by a neighbour.\"I tried to fight for my kids' life, where I had to watch them struggle and drown and I couldn't help them,\" she said.The neighbour, a football coach at the school the boys attended, heard her screams and was able to pull her out of the water.\"He said he heard the screaming or the call for help and came running. My friend had a horse rope, and he pulled me out with it,\" Hangaman said.In a statement, the local sheriff's office said the two older boys were pulled out of the water first by emergency workers and a neighbour, and taken to a local hospital.The six-year-old was later recovered after \"an extensive search of the pond\", the office added.Handout/AFP(From left to right) Kaleb, Howard and EJ were full of personality, their mother saidAuthorities did not release the children's names, but family members identified them as Howard Doss, six, Kaleb Doss, eight, and EJ Doss, nine.Describing her sons, Hangaman said EJ dreamed of becoming a football star, Kaleb loved to dance and sing, and the youngest, Howard, \"liked making people laugh\".The boys' school said they were \"devastated by this unimaginable loss\" in a letter to families seen by CBS News and that counsellors would be available to meet students and staff.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJaroslav LukivUkraine's DSNS emergency service/Kharkiv regionAt least one carriage of the passenger train was burning after the Russian drone attack in north-eastern UkraineUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned as \"terrorism\" a Russian drone attack on a crowded passenger train that local officials say killed at least five people and injured several others.More than 200 people were on the train, officials said, when one of the carriages was hit by a drone and two other drones exploded nearby, in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday.Zelensky said 18 people were in the carriage at the time and there was no \"military justification\" in targeting civilians.Russia has not commented on the strike, but it has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy and transport infrastructure during the harshest winter in years.Elsewhere in Ukraine, the southern port city of Odesa was hit by dozens of drones and officials said three people were killed and dozens more wounded. Energy officials said a local facility had suffered \"enormous damage\" overnight into Tuesday and Odesa city chief Serhii Lysak said attacks had continued for a second night into Wednesday.Meanwhile, in the Kyiv region, a couple were killed and their four-year-old child was hurt when a residential block of flats was hit in a district close to the capital, police said.Millions of people across Ukraine have been left without heating, electricity and water after the Russian assaults.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In a post on social media late on Tuesday, Zelensky wrote: \"In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be considered in exactly the same way - purely as terrorism.\"Pictures and footage released by Ukraine's emergency services show at least one badly destroyed carriage still burning after the attack.Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said the train was struck near the Yazykove village. The office said the train was heading from the western border town of Chop to Barvinkove in the Kharkiv region via the regional capital Kharkiv.This line runs further east to the Donetsk region, and is used by local residents and Ukrainian soldiers travelling to and from leave, as well as their wives and girlfriends travelling east to see them.EPA/ShutterstockSeveral floors of one residential building in Odesa collapsed after the Russian overnight strikeOfficials in Odesa said Russia had launched more than 50 drones on the port overnight into Tuesday.Three bodies were found in the rubble after several floors of one residential building collapsed after the strike, and a number of other buildings were damaged.Russia's daily aerial assaults continue even though Ukraine-Russia talks last week held the latest round of talks aimed at ending the war. The talks that also involved US negotiators took place in the United Arab Emirates, and were hailed by all sides as constructive. However, key territorial issues remain unresolved, and further meetings are expected this weekend.",

    "body": "A string of scandals and luxury handbags: Who is South Korea's former first lady?6 hours agoGavin ButlerandHyojung Kim,BBC World ServiceGetty ImagesThe scandals Kim Keon Hee faces predate her husband Yoon's ill-fated political careerTwo Chanel handbags, a BMW dealership and a controversial church were at the centre of a trial faced by South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee.The wife of disgraced former president Yoon Suk Yeol, she was arrested in August over a raft of charges including bribery, stock manipulation, and political interference - all of which she denies.Prosecutors had accused Kim, 52, of making more than 800 million won ($552,570; £404,050) by participating in a price-rigging scheme involving the stocks of Deutsch Motors, a BMW dealer in South Korea, between October 2010 and December 2012.She was also accused of accepting luxury bags, a diamond necklace and other gifts worth up to 80m won as bribes from the controversial Unification Church in exchange for business favours, and receiving 58 free opinion polls, worth 270 million Korean won, from political broker Myung Tae-kyun before the 2022 presidential election.On Wednesday, a court found her guilty of accepting bribes from Unification Church officials, sentencing her to 20 months in jail. However, she was cleared on charges of stock price manipulation and violating South Korea's campaign financing laws. There are still two cases against her that the court is yet to hear. The verdict comes less than a fortnight after her husband was sentenced to jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid.It also marks the first time in history that a presidential spouse has been indicted while detained.But it is far from the first time Kim herself has been embroiled in controversy.Questionable credentialsBefore she was South Korea's first lady, Kim Keon Hee – born Kim Myeong-sin – was a businesswoman and art lover.She graduated with an art education degree from Sookmyung Women's University in 1999, but would later face repeated allegations of plagiarism over her time as a student there – leading the university to annul her degree in 2025 after its research ethics panel found her thesis was compromised.She has never commented on these allegations publicly. In 2009, she founded art exhibition company Covana Contents, for which she is still CEO and president – but in 2019 South Korean media reported that she had allegedly evaded paying taxes and received kickbacks for hosting art exhibitions. Kim, who has stood down from her role, was cleared of these charges in 2023, but the special counsel is currently re-examining the case.Then, ahead of the 2022 presidential election which her husband ultimately won, allegations emerged that Kim had submitted applications to universities and companies containing false qualifications and awards, sparking a scandal over potentially fabricated credentials.In response to these allegations, which some opposition members had sought to use as a political cudgel against Yoon, Kim issued a public apology for what she described as \"exaggerations\" on her resume.She further pledged that if her husband became president she would \"focus solely on my role as his wife\".It is her conduct while in that role, however, that has drawn some of the fiercest backlash.The handbag scandalIn late-2023, spy camera footage surfaced showing Kim receiving a luxury handbag from an individual in a Seoul office in September 2022.The footage was reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch – and its publication intensified public scrutiny on both Kim and Yoon.It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3 million won ($2,200; £1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor: \"Why do you keep bringing me these things?\"South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1 million won in one go, or a total of 3 million won within a fiscal year.And while the video did not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported at the time that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was \"being managed and stored as a property of the government\".Getty ImagesYoon Suk Yeol and Kim Keon Hee mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailedThe presidential office did not immediately respond to the coverage, further fuelling the controversy, as civic groups filed complaints with the prosecution citing potential violations of the Anti-Graft Act.This incident was one of 16 allegations looked into by the special counsel team, 12 of which were passed to police for further investigation.Wednesday's verdict, however, focused on Kim allegedly accepting other bribes from the Unification Church, as well as her alleged involvement in Deutsch Motors stock manipulation and alleged election meddling.Kim denied the charges - although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she says she later returned without using.Prosecutors had last month called for a 15-year prison term and a fine of 2 billion won, saying she had \"stood above the law\" and colluded with the Unification Church to undermine the \"constitutionally mandated separation of religion and state\".DisgraceWhile Kim's string of scandals cast a shadow over her husband's presidential career, it was Yoon himself who ultimately sealed his own fate as one of South Korea's most disgraced former leaders.On 16 January, Yoon was found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.It was the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to Yoon's shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said while delivering the verdict, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".It was during a year-long probe into Yoon's failed martial law attempt that special prosecutors started investigating many of the allegations against Kim.Together, the once-powerful-couple make a historic pair: while South Korea has a history of former presidents being indicted and imprisoned, Yoon and Kim mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailed.",

    "body": "Who is Tom Homan, Trump's 'border tsar' deployed to Minneapolis?15 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter EPAUS President Donald Trump has deployed his \"border tsar\" Tom Homan to lead on-the-ground immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents in the city in less than a month.The White House has said Homan, who arrived in Minneapolis on Tuesday, will now be the \"main point of contact on the ground\" and will meet with city officials.It comes as Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief and public face of the Trump administration's mass deportation drive in cities across the US, is expected to leave the city along with some of his agents.Homan, 64, is seen both as a key Trump ally and someone with decades of experience in immigration policy across both Republican and Democratic administrations.He is also one of the most vocal defenders of Trump's immigration policy and mass deportation drive.A native of upstate New York, Homan began his career in law enforcement as a police officer before joining border patrol in 1984 in southern California. He joined what was then called the Immigration and Naturalization Service four years later, climbing through the ranks of US immigration enforcement over multiple years.  By 2013 - under the Obama administration - he held a little-known but influential post heading the Enforcement and Removal Operations arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)Homan had planned to retire in 2017, just days before Trump's first administration began. An abrupt call at his retirement party from incoming Chief of Staff John Kelly changed those plans. \"I remember him saying, I know it was bad timing, but the president-elect wanted me to stay and run [ICE],\" Homan recalled in an interview last year with the Daily Caller. \"Monday morning, I called [Kelly] and said I want to come back.\"A similar call, this time from current Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, again brought him out of retirement in 2024 ahead of the second administration.While \"border tsar\" is an informal term and position, it refers to an executive-branch role overseeing border and immigration policy across multiple agencies. It is not Senate confirmed, and is a policy position directly appointed by the serving president.So far in Trump's second term, Homan has been a vocal defender of the president's broad deportation goals, vowing to target the \"worst of the worst\" and challenge the notion that \"those who enforce the law are the bad guys and those who break the law are the victims\".But in practice, enforcing immigration laws and attempting to focus on public safety threats has also ensnared other undocumented migrants who have no criminal background - a fact that Homan acknowledges and blames on \"sanctuary cities\" that do not work with federal immigration efforts. Officials have said the act of being in the US illegally is a crime in itself. \"We're not going to instruct ICE not to arrest [someone] unless there's a serious crime,\" he told reporters in July at the White House, where he makes regular appearances. \"What message does that send the whole world? Go ahead and enter the country,\" Homan added. In September, the White House swiftly came to Homan's defence after reports emerged that he was accused in a bribery case that was ultimately dropped by the justice department when Trump returned to office. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described that case - which allegedly saw Homan accept $50,000 (£36,3000) from undercover agents - as an effort to \"entrap\" a key Trump ally. Who is Greg Bovino and why is he being replaced?Getty ImagesGregory Bovino's aggressive tactics have sparked controversy and criticism from lawmakers - including Republicans. Unlike Homan, Bovino has spent almost his entire law enforcement career in border cities, having first joined Border Patrol in 1996 and serving in a variety of US domestic postings as well as overseas in Honduras and Africa.The North Carolina native rose to prominence in Trump's second term, taking the lead during immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis. Bovino has been serving as \"commander-at-large\" in Border Patrol - an informal role outside of the organisation's formal hierarchy. Border Patrol is one of several immigration-centred agencies that operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Bovino reportedly answers directly to DHS head Kristi Noem. In his informal role, he works alongside officials like the Chief of Border Patrol, a position held by Michael Banks, and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, a position currently held by Rodney Scott.Bovino's tactics have been both controversial, particularly the aggressive \"turn and burn\" method of making swift arrests before protesters can arrive to an area. \"We're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next,\" he told the AP of the tactic. \"We're not going to stop.\" Bovino has also earned a reputation as an official willing to clash with lawmakers. In recent days, for example, Bovino has publicly sparred with lawmakers from both parties who expressed concern about his operations in Minneapolis. Will leadership switch mean change in Minneapolis?Bovino being replaced with Homan in Minneapolis is seen by some political observers as recognition from the White House that an urgent change was needed amid growing public concern. In practice, however, that change is ultimately unlikely to alter the administration's approach to immigration enforcement. \"Homan has more years at ICE and doing interior enforcement,\" former DHS immigration official Lora Ries told the BBC of his work in many American cities not near the border. \"This isn't a surprise to me.\" Ries, now head of the border security and immigration centre at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in Washington, added that while Homan has said he's sought to focus \"on the worst, first\", all deportable undocumented migrants will continue to be \"on the table\". For immigration activists, Homan's career - which has included staunch defence of Trump's family separation policy, which led to separating children from parents who are in the country illegally - also means that they see little practical difference between him and Bovino. \"I'm not sure it means much. Homan is a career deportation advocate, and the architect of family separation,\" said Michael Lukens, the executive director of the Amica Center, an organisation which helps immigrants with legal access and services. \"I think the difference is that he is more polished than Bovino. He is better at speaking to the press, and stakeholders,\" he added. \"He's better for what they need, someone to paint their actions as not what they are.\"\"This is much more about whether the White House sees this as a political issue, not a human one,\" Lukens added. \"But there is no world in which Homan is a moderate.\"",

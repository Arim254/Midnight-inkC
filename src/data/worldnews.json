    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

    "body": "19 hours agoLana LamSydneySouth Australia PoliceGus was last seen playing outside his house on the family's remote sheep stationPolice say a suspect has been identified over the disappearance of a four-year-old boy who went missing in the South Australian outback. Gus Lamont was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station near Yunta, about 300km (186 miles) from Adelaide, on 27 September.His grandmother left him alone for about half an hour before checking on him, only to find the boy missing, prompting one of the largest land and air searches in the state's history.Police said a person who lives on the property has been identified as a suspect but confirmed the boy's parents were not under investigation.In the days and weeks after the boy was reported missing, police conducted extensive searches, covering about 470 sq km - an area roughly twice the size of Edinburgh - around his home, the Oak Park station homestead.In late October, police wound down efforts and appointed a 12-member taskforce to continue the investigation.That taskforce sifted through previous statements given by family members which \"identified a number of inconsistencies and discrepancies\" of the timeline around the boy's disappearance.\"As a result of these inconsistencies, and investigations into them, a person who resides at Oak Park station has withdrawn their support for the police and is no longer cooperating with us,\" Detective Superintendent Darren Fielke said.\"I do want to stress, however, that Gus' parents are not suspects in his disappearance.\"Police conducted a search of the property in January and seized a number of items including a vehicle, motorcycle and some electronic devices. Investigators said they had initially considered three possible scenarios - the boy walked off,  he was abducted, or someone known to Gus was involved in his disappearance and suspected death.Given the remote location of the property, police ruled out abduction and there was no evidence to suggest Gus had \"merely wandered off\". \"What I can say, however, is that we'll continue to thoroughly and meticulously investigate the disappearance of Gus until we get an outcome,\" Fielke said.\"We're all focused and determined to locate Gus and return him to his parents. Nothing is off the table as we work towards that outcome.\"",

    "body": "Robbie Williams: British people are good at devaluing ourselves1 day agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesAfter more than three decades in entertainment, Robbie Williams is back on the road and ready to celebrate.The singer, whose Long 90s tour begins this week, is taking a moment to mark his achievement. \"I think as British people we're very good at piercing the balloon of our own success and undercutting it and devaluing ourselves,\" he tells BBC News. \"It's what we do best. In many ways it's why we're great.\"But with this one, I really want to let it sink in and I really want to stand in the middle of it and go, 'OK, success, do your thing to me'.\"The tour will take in smaller venues, the kind he would have played at the start of his solo stardom. The 51-year-old says Britpop is the album he wanted to make when he first left Take That. It sees him collaborate with former bandmate Gary Barlow, Gaz Coombes from Supergrass and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.But he looks back at the Britpop era with mixed feelings - he experienced professional huge success, but was also deeply depressed. Getty ImagesRobbie pictured with Liam Gallagher at Glastonbury in 1995, at the height of BritpopHe recalls: \"I was going through my own mental illness and anything good that's happening to somebody that is in the throes of depression... they can't experience joy and there were lots of incredible things happening and I couldn't experience joy from any of it.\"But now I look back at it and think, what a decade. The last great decade for popular culture because everything since then has become quite vanilla.\"You don't know 2007 from 2023, but you know the '50s, you know the '60s, you know the '70s you know the '80s and you know the '90s and so I look back and with a wry smile and say that the '90s was an amazing time to have a bad time.\"Robbie has spoken openly about suffering from stage fright in the past, experiencing terror before walking on stage. He tells me that everything \"clicked into place\" for him when his first child, daughter Theodora, known as Teddy, who was born in 2012. \"The world started to make sense because I'd been running away from responsibility and I should have been running towards it. \"And when things stopped being about me and started to become about precious souls, I started to realise I've got the best job in the world.\"Getty ImagesRobbie with Ayda and eldest daughter Teddy, who was born in 2012Williams says he also feels much happier being back in the UK, after a torrid experience with the British press, particularly in the early stages of his solo career. \"I think that everybody knows, because we've seen it countless times, that if you are on the crest of a wave, the media comes to bring you down and attack you and malign you at every opportunity they can. And that is heavy and brings its own problems.\"But that was then, I'm in a different place now,\" he continues. \"I'm left alone just to put my songs out and be married. \"There isn't anybody at my door trying to get pictures of me 24 hours a day or trying to pop microphones and bug my house or trying to hack my phone. There isn't any of that stuff that's happening anymore. This is what I thought it would be like when I set out on my journey when I was 16, I'm having an amazing time.\"Williams, pictured with the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher, says he's glad social media was not around earlier in his careerOne thing the singer did not have deal with back then was social media, and he tells me he thinks it would have \"seen him off\". \"I get way too invested in finding the negative things, everybody does,\" he says. \"I wonder if there's something wired in us where we go, ‘let's find the problem, let's find a threat and then we'll negate the threat’.\"Then, of course, there is the eternal question, will Robbie ever rejoin Take That? The band that launched his career.Williams has spoken of them \"riding again\" and says he \"absolutely loved\" the documentary, adding that he had \"overwhelming feeling of how much I love the boys\".Getty ImagesTake That were recently the subject of a Netflix documentary, which examined their successOn February 13 it will be 30 years since Take That split (the first time), it's also Robbie's birthday. So what was he doing that day in 1996? \"Buying a Scalextric from Harrods,\" he laughs. Not the rock'n'roll answer I expected.After breaking a record held by The Beatles and winning more Brit Awards than anyone else, I ask Robbie what he wants to do next.\"I want to build hotels with my own venues in and then I want to play my own hotels,\" he replies.\"I want to do a university of entertainment and I've got the syllabus in my mind and it would be a great revenge on education for somebody that left school with nothing higher than a D to go in and revolutionise education.\" Sign us up for the university of Robbie Williams.Britpop by Robbie Williams is out now. The Long 90s tour began earlier this week. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoJoel GunterJerusalemNurPhoto via Getty ImagesA Palestinian man sells cigarettes in central Gaza (file photo)Israeli prosecutors have charged the brother of the head of the country's intelligence agency, Shin Bet, with \"aiding the enemy in wartime\" by allegedly smuggling cigarettes into Gaza.An indictment against Bezalel Zini published on Thursday argues he was aware that Hamas might profit from the resale of cigarettes and tobacco at inflated prices.Zini, 50, a reservist on active duty in the Israeli military, is said to have smuggled 14 cartons of cigarettes - 7,000 individual packets - in exchange for a total of 365,000 shekels ($117,000; £86,000).His brother, the recently appointed Shin Bet chief David Zini, is not suspected of any wrongdoing.Israel has tightly controlled the flow of humanitarian aid and other goods into Gaza during the conflict with Hamas.The charges are part of a wider set of indictments against more than a dozen individuals, alleging that an organised crime ring smuggled brand new, top-end iPhones, car parts, and other electronics into Gaza.The sale of smuggled tobacco and cigarettes alone put \"hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas's coffers since the start of the war\", the indictment alleges.Prosecutors say the smuggling operation began in the summer of 2025, before the ceasefire in October, when the fighting was still raging in the strip.They say the smugglers pretended they were entering Gaza as part of their military duties, misleading Israeli soldiers on the border crossing points.The indictment against Bezalel Zini also accuses him of fraud, receiving a bribe, and tax offences. He was arrested two weeks ago along with two alleged accomplices, who were also charged with smuggling.Zini's defence lawyers said their client denied the charges, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, arguing that the application of a terrorism law was not appropriate for the alleged smuggling of cigarettes.\"Regarding the offence of aiding the enemy during wartime, it is a complete inversion of reality. This is someone who has given everything and risked his life for the state,\" the paper quoted one of his lawyers as saying.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSamantha GranvilleBeirutReutersThe Israeli military declined to comment on the allegationsLebanon has accused Israeli aircraft of spraying an agricultural herbicide over southern villages at concentrations authorities described as dangerously high, raising concerns for food and environmental security.The agriculture and environment ministries said laboratory tests confirmed the substance was glyphosate, a chemical used to destroy vegetation, with concentrations in some samples \"between 20 and 30 times the levels usually accepted\".President Joseph Aoun condemned the spraying of what he described as \"toxic substances\", calling it a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and an environmental and health crime.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had no comment on the matter.The purpose behind the release of herbicide on the villages remains unclear.Residents in several border villages reported the spraying, which comes more than a year after a ceasefire ended a war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.Earlier in the week, United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon said they had been notified by Israel of planned spraying near the border and were advised to take shelter.The communication forced them to cancel some of their planned operations. They said this was not the first time Israeli forces had dropped unknown chemical substances from aircraft over Lebanese territory.With tens of thousands still displaced after hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in 2023-24, the challenges for returning home are compounded, according to Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Lebanon.\"These areas are heavily dependent on agriculture - olive groves, tobacco, and other crops - and this incident complicates people's ability to return to their homes, maintain their livelihoods, and rebuild after extensive destruction,\" Kaiss said.Experts warn that incidents like this do not only harm local ecosystems but also have broader economic consequences for Lebanon's farming sector.In April 2025, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization reported that the 2024 conflict had caused more than $700m (£515m; 600m euros ) in damage and losses to Lebanon's agricultural sector, particularly in the south and the Bekaa Valley.Environmental groups like Green Southerners in Lebanon also expressed concern about the impact on agricultural production and soil fertility.\"These actions threaten ecosystems already damaged by white phosphorus, with serious risks to insect communities and natural pollinators, undermining biodiversity, food security, and local livelihoods,\" the group said in an Instagram post.But there's no universal consensus on the risks of glyphosate.The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies it as \"probably carcinogenic to humans,\" citing a link to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while other regulatory bodies, including the US Environmental Protection Agency and European Food Safety Authority, have concluded it is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.The Lebanese foreign ministry said it intended to submit a formal complaint against Israel to the UN Security Council.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the talks had not been easy and he wanted \"faster results\".EPA/ShutterstockThe exchanged Russian soldiers were currently staying in Belarus, the Russian defence ministry saidRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In a post on social media, Zelensky wrote that Thursday's prisoner exchange \"took place after a long pause\" - referring to the previous such swap last October.\"We are returning our people home - 157 Ukrainians. Soldiers of the Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Service.\"And civilians are also returning with the defenders. Most have been in captivity since 2012,\" the Ukrainian president said, pledging to bring back every single Ukrainian still in Russian captivity.  Ukrainians officials said 139 had been in Russian captivity since 2022.Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said 157 of its POWs were returned by Kyiv.The ministry added that three Russian civilians \"illegally held\" were also handed back. They were residents of the western Kursk region, parts of which were occupied by Ukraine during its incursion in 2024-25.The talks in Abu Dhabi - the second round in recent weeks - are part of US President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner have been leading the negotiations. The talks had been \"detailed and productive\", Witkoff wrote on X, but added that \"significant work remains\".The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.Another key sticking point is believed to be Kyiv's demand to get robust security guarantees from its European allies and the US. No details have been released.  The trilateral talks began as Russia renewed its deadly attacks on Ukraine after a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.",

    "body": "A global craze for Korean culture is making its humblest snacks unaffordable1 day agoYuna Ku,SeoulandSuhnwook Lee,SeoulGetty ImagesSouth Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of dried gimBlack, crispy, often flat and square - dried seaweed, known locally as gim - is a humble staple on everyday dining tables across South Korea. But as its global popularity grows, its rising prices are worrying gim-lovers nationwide.Lee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for the past 47 years. \"In the past, people from Western countries thought Koreans were eating something weird that looks like a piece of black paper,\" the vendor, who is in her 60s, says from a small market stall in central Seoul.\"I never thought I'd be selling gim to them. But now, they all come here and buy it.\"South Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of gim, supplying markets across Asia, North America and Europe. Some even refer to the product as Korea's \"black semiconductor\", a reference to South Korea's large share of the global semiconductor industry. Exports have risen steadily in recent years - and in 2025, South Korea's dried seaweed exports hit a record $1.13bn, according to the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI).And as demand rises, so do prices.Known locally as an affordable snack or ingredient, gim typically cost around 100 won ($0.06; £0.05) per sheet in 2024 - with the snack usually sold in bundles of 10 sheets or more, or around $0.60 per pack.  But last month, the price of one sheet of gim rose to above 150 won - a record high in the country. \"Premium products now cost as much as 350 won per sheet,\" said Lee. BBC/Suhnwook LeeLee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for 47 years Kim Jaela, who's in her 30s, typically buys gim in bulk - about 500 small sheets at a time, enough to last her several months. But she says this may need to change, considering how expensive gim has become. She does most of her grocery shopping online, and was checking prices on her phone during the interview.\"Oh my, it really did get more expensive by a few dollars! Luckily, I can survive a few more weeks with two packs of gim, but if I see the same or higher price later, I probably won't restock,\" she said.A humble Korean staple The worldwide appetite for gim reflects a growing global demand in Korean goods, driven by cultural influences like K-pop and K-dramas. As global audiences engage more deeply with such entertainment, they're also increasing looking to Korean cuisine, something businesses worldwide have picked up on. In 2023, US supermarket chain Trader Joe's Gimbap - a Korean rice roll wrapped in seaweed - went viral and was cleared off the shelves nationwide shortly after its launch.\"I first learned about gim because it's a typical Korean food often seen in K-dramas,\" Miki, a 22-year-old visitor from Japan told the BBC. \"We do have similar thing called nori in Japan, but the taste is totally different. Gim is lighter and crispier, and is mostly grilled with sesame oil and salt, whereas nori is typically seasoned with soy sauce.\"Viola, a 60-year-old visitor from Brooklyn, New York, says she enjoys gim as a snack. \"I just pop it in my mouth like a potato chip,\" she said, adding that it feels like a \"healthier alternative\". \"From Asian to Western countries, more people are becoming familiar with gim, increasing global demand,\" said Lee Eunhee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University. \"To meet overseas demand, domestic prices are being pushed up.\"Kim Namin, 29, runs a seasoned gim processing factory with a 30-year family history in Wando, an island in South Korea's southern waters known for abalone and seaweed production. His factory purchases raw seaweed, grills it with oil and salt, and cuts it into the familiar rectangular sheets sold in stores.Over the past five years, most of their products have been exported globally. \"There aren't enough gim factories compared to the rising demand,\" he said, saying that his family is now considering expanding operations.He adds that gim is a highly price-sensitive staple in South Korea, long associated with affordability. Even marginal increases in its cost are keenly felt by consumers and tend to provoke strong public resistance - another reason why he's  focusing more on overseas markets.Government officials and experts say the price increase is being driven by multiple factors, including overall inflation, rising labour costs, and a decline in overseas production. However, many agree that increased growing global demand remains a major driver.In an effort to appease domestic consumers, companies - alongside the government - are taking steps to curb rising costs.South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has pledged to closely monitor the situation to stabilise its price. and Korean food companies like Pulmone have plans to establish a land-based seaweed R&D centre, so they can be harvested throughout the year. Back in Seoul, the market buzzes with tourists, and business is booming for Lee. \"Gim has been selling like hot cakes... the ones for making gimbap are especially popular,\" she says. \"I'm glad Korean gim is getting popular.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThe US negotiators will be led by special envoy Steve Witkoff (left), while the Iranian team is headed by Foreign Minister Abbas AraghchiSenior US and Iranian officials are expected to meet in Oman later for direct talks amid a crisis that has raised fears of a military confrontation between the two countries.The discussions come after a US military build-up in the Middle East in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month, that human rights groups say killed many thousands of people.Uncertainty over the location and scope had threatened to derail the talks, which are part of a diplomatic effort by regional mediators to de-escalate tensions.Both countries remain far apart in their positions. The hope is that, if successful, the discussions could lead to a framework for negotiations.The US, which is demanding Iran freezes its nuclear programme and discards its stockpile of enriched uranium, had said the talks should also involve Iran's ballistic missiles, the country's support for regional armed groups and its treatment of its citizens. Iran, however, has said the discussions will be limited to its nuclear programme, and it is unclear if these differences have been resolved.In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it does not reach a deal. The US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region, including an aircraft carrier along with other warships as well as fighter jets. Iran has vowed to respond to an attack with force, threatening to strike American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.The Iranian delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who last week said his country's armed forces were \"with their fingers on the trigger\", while the US will be represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Watch: Iran's supreme leader 'should be very worried' amid tensions, Trump saysThis will be the first meeting involving US and Iranian officials since the war between Israel and Iran last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities. Iran says its uranium enrichment activity stopped after the attacks.For Iran's embattled leaders, the talks could be the last chance to avert US military action that could further destabilise the regime, which analysts say is in its weakest position since it came to power following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Trump's threats came as Iran's security forces brutally repressed large-scale demonstrations, which were triggered by a deepening economic crisis, and saw protesters calling for the end of the Islamic Republic. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group, said it had confirmed at least 6,883 deaths, warning that the number could be much higher, and that more than 50,000 people had been arrested.The current crisis has brought back to discussions the issue of Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West. For decades, Iran has said its programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of being part of an effort to develop a weapon.Iran says it has the right to enrich uranium in its own territory and has rejected calls for its stockpile of highly enriched uranium - 400kg (880lb) - to be transferred to a third country. Officials have indicated being open to concessions, which could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as proposed during talks with the US that collapsed when Israel launched its surprise war last year.At the same time, Iran says demands to limit the country's ballistic missile programme and to end the support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hamas in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - are unacceptable and a breach of its sovereignty.On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had instructed Araghchi to \"pursue fair and equitable negotiations\" with the US, \"provided that a suitable environment exists\". In any case, Iran is expected to demand the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline.For the US, the meeting, depending on its outcome, could offer an offramp for Trump from his military threats. Regional countries are concerned that a US strike could lead to a wider conflict or long-term chaos in Iran, and have warned that air power alone will not be able to topple the Iranian leadership.Asked if Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News on Wednesday: \"I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be\".US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the discussions would have to go beyond the nuclear issue for \"something meaningful\" to be achieved. \"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out. We don't see there's any harm in trying to figure out if there's something that can be done,\" he said.The talks, initially planned to be held in Istanbul, are an effort led by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar to defuse tensions. Iran, however, asked at the last minute for the location of the meeting to be changed to Oman, which hosted discussions last year, and for it to be limited to Iranian and American officials.",

    "body": "Growing calls in India to restrict children's social media use1 day agoAbhishek DeyGuwahatiGetty ImagesExperts say that a social media ban would not be easy in India and could face legal challengesA debate around banning social media for children under 16 is gathering momentum in India, with ministers in several states saying they are studying a law that recently came into effect in Australia.Ministers in at least two southern states have said recently that they are checking if a ban would be effective in keeping children away from social media. And last week, the Economic Survey - an annual document written by a team led by India's chief economic adviser - recommended that the federal government consider age-based limits for social media use by children. The survey's recommendations are not binding on the government but can inform policy decisions.Experts, however, warn that such a ban would not be easy in India and could face legal challenges.Australia recently became the first country in the world to ban most social media platforms for children under 16, making it mandatory for platforms to verify users' ages and disable accounts by underage users.The move sparked criticism from social media platforms which, Australia's internet regulator told the BBC last month, came to the regime \"kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly\". Last week, lawmakers in France's lower house approved a bill that would ban social media access for under-15s. It still needs to be passed by the Senate.The UK is also considering a ban.In India, LSK Devarayalu, a lawmaker from the regional Telugu Desam Party - which governs Andhra Pradesh state and is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal coalition - proposed a bill last week seeking to bar children under 16 from using social media.As a private member's bill, the proposal does not reflect government policy and is unlikely to become law - but it could shape parliamentary debates.Separately, the Andhra Pradesh government has set up a group of ministers to study global regulatory frameworks and invited major platforms, including Meta, X, Google and ShareChat, for consultations. The companies haven't commented on the invitation yet.The state's Information Technology Minister Nara Lokesh last week said on X that children were \"slipping into relentless usage\" of social media, affecting their attention spans and education.\"We will ensure social media becomes a safer space and reduce its damaging impact - especially for women and children,\" he added.Other states have expressed interest in similar measures.Goa's Tourism and IT Minister Rohan Khaunte said the state was examining whether a ban could be implemented, adding that more details would follow.Priyank Kharge, the IT minister of Karnataka - home to Bengaluru city which is known as India's Silicon Valley - told the state assembly that the government was discussing responsible use of artificial intelligence and social media, and referred to a \"digital detox\" programme involving around 300,000 students and 100,000 teachers that the government launched in partnership with Meta.Kharge, however, did not specify whether legislation was being considered or which age groups might be affected.AFP via Getty ImagesAustralia is the first country in the world to ban most social media platforms for children under 16But enforcing state-level bans would be complicated, says digital rights activist Nikhil Pahwa. \"While companies can infer users' locations through IP addresses, such systems are often inaccurate. Where state boundaries are very close, you can end up creating conflicts if one state bans social media use and another does not.\"He also points to difficulties around age verification, saying the issue was not unique to India. \"Age verification is not simple. To adhere to such bans, companies would effectively have to verify every individual using every service on the internet,\" Pahwa told the BBC.Even in Australia, some children have told the BBC that they get around the ban by using fake birthdays to create new accounts.According to Prateek Waghre, a public policy expert and head of programmes at the Tech Global Institute, enforcement would also depend on the cooperation of platforms and intermediaries. \"In theory, location can be inferred through IP addresses by internet service providers or technology companies, but whether the companies operating such apps would comply, or challenge such directions in court, is not yet clear,\" he says.While lawmakers have identified a genuine problem, a ban seems to be an overly narrow response, experts think. A recent study by a non-profit organisation that surveyed 1,277 Indian teenagers suggests that age-based restrictions and verification systems may face additional hurdles in India's digital landscape. Many accounts, it says, are created with help from family members or friends and are not linked to personal email addresses, complicating assumptions of individual ownership that underpin age-verification systems.While some parents in India have welcomed the idea of a ban online, others point out a deeper issue.\"Parents themselves fail to give enough time to children and hand them phones to keep them engaged - the problem starts there,\" says Delhi resident Jitender Yadav, who has two daughters aged eight and four. \"I am not sure if a social media ban will help. Because unless parents give enough time to their children or learn to keep them creatively engaged, they will always find ways to bypass such bans,\" he says.",

    "body": "Aid workers missing after airstrikes hit South Sudan hospital 13 hours agoWycliffe MuiaandAlfred LasteckMSFHumanitarian access has been restricted by the government in opposition-held parts of JongleiAn unknown number of aid workers are missing after air strikes hit a hospital in South Sudan, near the Ethiopian border, a charity group says.The hospital, run by medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Jonglei state, \"was hit in an air strike by the government of South Sudan forces during the night on Tuesday\", MSF said. The South Sudan government is yet to comment. In a separate attack, MSF said its health facility in Pieri, also in Jonglei state, was on the same day looted by unknown assailants, leaving it \"unusable for the local community\".\"Our colleagues had to flee with the community and their fate and whereabouts are still unknown,\" the medical organisation said. There has been a resurgence in fighting in Jonglei state recently between government forces and those loyal to First Vice-President Riek Machar, who has been suspended from his post after being accused of plotting to overthrow President Salva Kiir.There are fears that the fighting could re-ignite a full-blown civil war in the world's youngest nation.Jonglei, one of the most food-insecure parts of the country with severe health needs, has seen an estimated 280,000 people displaced by fighting and aerial bombardments since December, the UN said. MSF said that ahead of Tuesday's first attack in the Lankien area, it had received information about a possible strike, so the hospital was \"evacuated and patients were discharged hours before the attack\".\"One staff member was injured, and the hospital's main warehouse was destroyed along with medical supplies,\" the group said in a statement.Lankien has been at the centre of renewed fighting in recent weeks between government troops and opposition forces.\"The hospital's main warehouse was destroyed during the attack, and we lost most of our critical supplies for providing medical care,\" the group added. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack but MSF said: \"The government of South Sudan armed forces are the only armed party with the capacity to perform aerial attacks in the country.\"MSF said it was the only health provider serving around 250,000 people in Lankien and Pieri, warning that attacks on its facilities there \"mean that local communities will be left without any healthcare\".\"While we are aware of the enormous needs in the country, we find it unacceptable to be a target for attacks,\" said Gul Badshah, MSF's operations manager.The medical charity said it had experienced eight targeted attacks in South Sudan last year, forcing the closure of two hospitals in Greater Upper Nile and the suspension of general healthcare activities in Jonglei, Upper Nile and Central Equatoria states. In December, the South Sudanese government imposed restrictions on humanitarian access in opposition-held areas of Jonglei, limiting MSF's ability to deliver essential medical assistance.Fighting between forces loyal to Machar and Kiir first broke out in 2013, two years after independence.A 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between the pair has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.Machar is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.More about South Sudan from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 hour agoAshay YedgeBBC MarathiDevesh Chopra/BBCThese women work with the local forest department to track and protect the snow leopard species In one of India's coldest and most remote regions, a group of women have taken on an unlikely role: protecting one of Asia's most elusive predators, the snow leopard.Snow leopards are found in just 12 countries across Central and South Asia. India is home to one of the world's largest populations, with a nationwide survey in 2023 - the first comprehensive count ever carried out in the country - estimating more than 700 animals, .One of the places they roam is around Kibber village in Himachal Pradesh state's Spiti Valley, a stark, high-altitude cold desert along the Himalayan belt. Here, snow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\", slipping silently across rocky slopes and rarely revealing themselves.For generations, the animals were seen largely as a threat, for attacking livestock. But attitudes in Kibber and neighbouring villages are beginning to shift, as people increasingly recognise the snow leopard's role as a top predator in the food chain and its importance in maintaining the region's fragile mountain ecosystem.Nearly a dozen local women are now working alongside the Himachal Pradesh forest department and conservationists to track and protect the species, playing a growing role in conservation efforts.Locally, the snow leopard is known as Shen and the women call their group \"Shenmo\". Trained to install and monitor camera traps, they handle devices fitted with unique IDs and memory cards that automatically photograph snow leopards as they pass.\"Earlier, men used to go and install the cameras and we kept wondering why couldn't we do it too,\" says Lobzang Yangchen, a local coordinator working with a small group supported by the non-profit Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the forest department.Yangchen was among the women who helped collect data for Himachal Pradesh's snow leopard survey in 2024, which found that the state was home to 83 snow leopards - up from 51 in 2021.Spiti Wildlife DivisionSnow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\" because they are so hard to spotThe survey documented snow leopards and 43 other species using camera traps spread across an area of nearly 26,000sq km (10,000sq miles). Individual leopards were identified by the unique rosette patterns on their fur, a standard technique used for spotted big cats. The findings are now feeding into wider conservation and habitat-management plans.\"Their contribution was critical to identifying individual animals,\" says Goldy Chhabra, deputy conservator of forests with the Spiti Wildlife Division.Collecting the data is demanding work. Most of it takes place in winter, when heavy snowfall pushes snow leopards and their prey to lower altitudes, making their routes easier to track.On survey days, the women wake up early, finish household chores and gather at a base camp before travelling by vehicle as far as the terrain allows. From there, they trek several kilometres to reach camera sites, often at altitudes above 14,000ft (4,300m), where the thin air makes even simple movement exhausting.The BBC accompanied the group on one such trek in December. After hours of walking in biting cold, the women suddenly stopped on a narrow trail.Yangchen points to pugmarks in the dust: \"This shows the snow leopard has been here recently. These pugmarks are fresh.\"Devesh Chopra/BBCThe women set up cameras with unique IDs and memory cards, which capture an image of a snow leopard as soon as it passes throughAlong with pugmarks, the team looks for other signs, including scrapes and scent‑marking spots, before carefully fixing a camera to a rock along the trail.One woman then carries out a \"walk test\", crawling along the path to check whether the camera's height and angle will capture a clear image.The group then moves on to older sites, retrieving memory cards and replacing batteries installed weeks earlier.By mid-afternoon, they return to camp to log and analyse the images using specialised software - tools many had never encountered before.\"I studied only until grade five,\" says Chhering Lanzom. \"At first, I was scared to use the computer. But slowly, we learned how to use the keyboard and mouse.\"The women joined the camera-trapping programme in 2023. Initially, conservation was not their motivation. But winters in the Spiti Valley are long and quiet, with little agricultural work to fall back on. \"At first, this work on snow leopards didn't interest us,\" Lobzang says. \"We joined because we were curious and we could earn a small income.\"The women earn between 500 ($5.46; £4) and 700 rupees a day. But beyond the money, the work has helped transform how the community views the animal.Spiti Wildlife DivisionImages captured by the camera traps are analysed using a special software\"Earlier, we thought the snow leopard was our enemy,\" says Dolma Zangmo, a local resident. \"Now we think their conservation is important.\"Alongside survey work, the women help villagers access government insurance schemes for their livestock and promote the use of predator‑proof corrals - stone or mesh enclosures that protect animals at night.Their efforts come at a time of growing recognition for the region. Spiti Valley has recently been included in the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, a Unesco-recognised network aimed at conserving fragile ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods.As climate change reshapes the fragile trans-Himalayan landscape, conservationists say such community participation will be crucial to safeguarding species like the snow leopard.\"Once communities are involved, conservation becomes more sustainable,\" says Deepshikha Sharma, programme manager with NCF's High Altitudes initiative.\"These women are not just assisting, they are becoming practitioners of wildlife conservation and monitoring,\" she adds.As for the women, their work makes them feel closer to their home, the village and the mountains that raised them, they say. \"We were born here, this is all we know,\" Lobzang says. \"Sometimes we feel afraid because these snow leopards are after all predatory animals, but this is where we belong.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterSir Keir Starmer says sorry to Epstein victims for appointing MandelsonSir Keir Starmer has apologised to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for believing Lord Mandelson's \"lies\" and appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US.The prime minister began a planned speech on funding to improve local communities by addressing the growing anger over how he had dealt with the issue.While he acknowledged it had been publicly known for some time that Lord Mandelson knew Epstein, he said: \"None of us knew the depths and the darkness of that relationship.\"However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM's position was \"untenable\", while the Liberal Democrats called for a confidence vote to see if Labour MPs supported him.The prime minister is facing calls from some of his own MPs to stand down. While the handful of backbenchers to do so publicly are frequent critics of the PM, many more have raised concerns privately.Sir Keir's former political director Luke Sullivan said he thought the PM was \"fighting for his premiership\".He told the BBC's Newscast: \"I don't think you can understate how serious the situation and the peril is that the prime minister finds himself in.\"Seeking to defuse the row in a speech earlier, Sir Keir said he regretted appointing Lord Mandelson and would not have done so if he had known what he knows now.Directly addressing Epstein's victims, he said:  \"I am sorry, sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you. Sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies and appointed him and sorry that even now you're forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.\"Reacting to Sir Keir's apology, Epstein survivor Marina Lacerda said: \"I have to commend him for going on national television and admitting he was wrong and apologising to us.\"Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, she said: \"I think that's a huge step, right. You have also people here in America that have not even tried to apologise to us. \"So I have to commend him for that.\"Watch: I have to commend Starmer for apologising, says Epstein survivor Marina LacerdaSir Keir has promised to release files, which he says will prove Lord Mandelson lied about the extent of his friendship with Epstein when he was being vetted for the US ambassador role.The government was forced into a climbdown by Labour backbenchers, after it had planned to withhold some sensitive material. After a Commons vote, the government will pass documents which could damage national security or diplomatic relations to Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), rather than withholding them.The ISC says the government should decide which documents are made public - and which are not.They say this will be done by the cabinet secretary, with an expectation the documents are laid before parliament \"very shortly\".At the time Lord Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador in December 2024, it was public knowledge that he had maintained a friendship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.The PM said Lord Mandelson was asked directly about the nature of his relationship with Epstein before he was appointed as ambassador, whether he had stayed at his home after his conviction and whether he had accepted gifts and hospitality from him.\"The information now available makes clear that the answers he gave were lies,\" he said.\"He portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew.\"And when that became clear and it was not true, I sacked him.\"The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.Challenged after his speech over whether he should stand down as PM, Sir Keir said he understood the \"anger and frustration amongst Labour MPs\" over Lord Mandelson.However, he added: \"I was elected on a mandate in 2024 to change the country for the better... that's what I intend to do.\"Labour MP Rachael Maskell told BBC Radio York Sir Keir's position was \"untenable\" he had \"no choice\" but to step down.Meanwhile, Paula Barker, who represents Liverpool Wavertree, said the PM \"has shown that his judgement is questionable\".\"I think he has a very long way to build trust and confidence with public and trust and confidence within our party as a whole,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Jonathan Hinder, the MP for Pendle and Clitheroe, said the PM's decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as US ambassador was a \"catastrophic error of political and moral judgement\".He called on Sir Keir to speak to Labour MPs in person and acknowledge this.Sir Keir has also faced calls to sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was close to Lord Mandelson and widely thought to have lobbied for his appointment.Karl Turner, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said the PM had been given \"shoddy\" advice over the appointment.ReutersLord Mandelson was sacked as US ambassador last SeptemberHe told the BBC he did not want a new prime minister but called on Sir Keir to \"get a grip\" and for McSweeney to go.Downing Street has insisted the PM has full confidence in his chief of staff.Lord Mandelson was sacked last September, following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.In recent days, more documents released by the US Department of Justice have laid bare the extent of their relationship.They include emails suggesting Epstein made payments worth thousands of pounds to Lord Mandelson and his partner.Police are investigating allegations of misconduct in public office, after other emails in the files suggested Lord Mandelson forwarded on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary during the financial crisis in 2009.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.",

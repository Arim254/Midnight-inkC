    "body": "A New Zealand man has been charged for theft after he allegedly stole a diamond-studded locket in a rather unusual way - by swallowing it. The ingested loot - a Fabergé egg locket valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600) - has not yet been recovered, police told local media outlets.Police were called to Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland last Friday afternoon and the 32-year-old man was arrested in store minutes later.  He has undergone a medical assessment and remains in custody, police say. The allegedly stolen Fabergé egg is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18K gold miniature octopus.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to reports, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will resume on 30 December, over a decade after the aircraft with 239 people on board vanished, Malaysian authorities have said.This fresh search, which will run for 55 days, had begun in March but was suspended shortly after because of poor weather conditions.\"The latest development underscores the [Malaysia's] commitment to providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,\" the transport ministry said Wednesday, according to local media.Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and sparked the largest search in aviation history.Exploration firm Ocean Infinity is leading the current search under a \"no find, no fee\" arrangement. It will receive $70m (£56m) if the wreckage is found, Transport Minister Loke Siew Fook earlier said.Previous attempts include a multinational search involving 60 ships and 50 aircraft from 26 countries, which ended in 2017, and a 2018 effort by Ocean Infinity ended after three months.Flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control less than an hour after take-off on 8 March 2014, and radar showed it had deviated from its original flight path.It remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries, which continues to haunt the families of those on board. Over the years, many had called for a new search, noting their struggle to find closure.The incident has also given rise to a host of conspiracy theories, including speculation that the pilot had deliberately brought the plane down or that it had been hijacked.An investigation in 2018 found that the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but drew no conclusions behind it.Investigators said at the time that \"the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found\".",

However, this study design cannot provide confirmation that the association is causal,\" the government told parliament.Delhi's average AQI has crossed the \"severe\" 400 mark many times over the past decade, especially in winter -  levels that can harm even healthy people and pose serious risks to those with existing illnesses.On Wednesday morning, Delhi's average AQI was around 380, according to the government-backed Safar app.The BBC reported last week how many hospitals in Delhi and its suburbs are seeing an influx of children who are sick because of the toxic air.The Delhi high court is set to hear a petition on Wednesday calling for urgent measures to curb hazardous air pollution.Over the past few years, India's top court has also raised concerns about the air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "A shipment of German ammunition has been stolen from a delivery lorry in the eastern town of Burg, the country's defence ministry has said. Speaking to Germany's DPA news agency, officials did not specify how much was taken. However, other reports cited a defence spokesperson as saying it was close to 20,000 rounds.The theft is thought to have taken place after the driver for a civilian transport company - contracted by the military - left his truck in an unguarded parking lot overnight on 25 November.The next day, when the delivery arrived at the nearby Clausewitz Barracks, the ammunition was found to be missing. The army has launched an investigation alongside police.Der Spiegel, among other German outlets, reported that the shipment contained 10,000 rounds of live ammunition for pistols, 9,900 rounds of blank bullets for assault rifles, and smoke grenades.Authorities have not confirmed whether anyone has been arrested or identified in connection with the incident, which has prompted security concerns around who may acquire the lost supplies.\"We take the theft very seriously - this kind of ammunition must not fall into the wrong hands,\" the defence ministry told German media.A focal point of the Bundeswehr (German army)'s investigation will be why the driver failed to identify a safe location for the stop, according to Germany's public broadcaster MDR.It reports that there is a special hotline available to drivers who need similar assistance and said the armed forces can provide an escort if required. The broadcaster said the driver left the vehicle in an unguarded parking lot and spent the night in a nearby hotel.This is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the the Saxony-Anhalt region.In August, local police in Bernburg reported 90 rounds of ammunition missing. Weeks earlier, officers in Eisleben reported they had lost 180 rounds.No immediate connection has been made between the cases.",

    "body": "16 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPope Leo said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the site of the Beirut port blastPope Leo XIV led a silent prayer at the site of the Beirut port explosion and demanded justice for its victims, as he wrapped up his three-day visit to Lebanon.He also met some relatives of the 218 people who were killed by the massive blast on 4 August 2020, which devastated a large part of the capital.Later, the Pope said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the port and shared \"the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country\".No-one has yet been held accountable for the disaster, which happened when a fire triggered the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at a port warehouse for almost six years.It is widely believed that officials and politicians were aware of the combustible chemical's existence and the danger it posed but that they failed to secure, remove or destroy it.Victims' relatives and activists say the domestic investigation into the disaster has been hampered by the political leadership's efforts to shield those responsible from scrutiny.Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed, said the Pope's visit to the memorial was \"very important\". \"We know that he raises his voice for justice, and we need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,\" she added.Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, said: \"He's trying to help us find the truth in some sort of way, in his way, maybe in praying and maybe in just looking at us... We, the families, now, after five years, we need people to look at us.\"EPAAn estimated 150,000 people gathered at Beirut's waterfront for the Pope's final Mass in LebanonAfter praying at the blast site, the Pope celebrated the final Mass of his trip in front of an estimated 150,000 people gathered on Beirut's waterfront.Addressing the crowd, he lamented that the beauty of Lebanon had been \"overshadowed by poverty and suffering, the wounds that have marked your history\".But he appealed to the country's diverse communities to unite to solve its problems.\"Let us cast off the armour of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\" he said. \"A Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognise each other as brothers and sisters.\"Returning to Rome on Tuesday, the Pope told reporters that Lebanon was an example of \"a land where Islam and Christianity are both present and are respected\".He later added: \"I think those are lessons that would be important to be heard in Europe or North America - that we should perhaps be a little less fearful, and look at ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.\"Since the last papal visit in 2012, Lebanon has been plagued by multiple crises.In 2019, the country suffered one of the worst economic depressions recorded in modern times, which pushed millions into poverty.It was followed by mass anti-government protests, the coronavirus pandemic, and then the Beirut port explosion.Political paralysis prevented the country from passing the economic and structural reforms demanded by foreign donors in return for billions of dollars in aid.Lebanon was later devastated by the 13-month war between the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement and Israel, which killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis.A ceasefire ended the conflict a year ago, but Israel has continued to attack targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, accusing the Iran-backed group of trying to rearm.Additional reporting by Aleem Maqbool",

    "body": "Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 secondsYouTube says Australia's \"rushed\" new laws to block teens from its platform will mean children will be less safe as its \"robust parental controls\" will be stripped away.Parents will \"lose their ability to supervise their teen or tween's account\" such as content settings or blocking channels from 10 December when a social media ban for under-16s starts. Children will still be able to view videos but without an account.Communications Minister Anika Wells responded by saying it was \"outright weird\" that YouTube was highlighting the dangers of its platform for children.\"If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe ... that's a problem that YouTube needs to fix,\" Wells said on Wednesday.The platform's statement comes as Australia's internet regulator sets her sights on two little-known apps that teens have flocked to in the lead-up to the country's social media ban.Lemon8, owned by the creators behind TikTok, and Yope are video and photo-sharing apps that have seen a rise in downloads recently, prompting eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant to ask them to self-assess if they fall under the ban.The government reversed an exemption for YouTube from the ban in July, with the eSafety Commissioner saying it was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".In a statement on Wednesday, the video-sharing platform said it would comply but that the new law undermined more than a decade's work in  building \"robust protections and parental controls that families rely on for a safer YouTube experience\".\"Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" wrote Rachel Lord, public policy senior manager at Google and YouTube Australia, adding that parents and educators shared these concerns.She labelled the ban - which comes under the Social Media Minimum Age Act - as \"rushed regulation that misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it\".From 10 December, anyone under 16 will be automatically signed out of their YouTube account, meaning they cannot upload content or post comments. YouTube Kids is not part of the ban. In addition, default wellbeing settings such as reminders to take a break or go to bed will no longer be available to children as they only work for account holders. Ms Lord said the legislation had \"failed to allow for adequate consultation and consideration of the real complexities of online safety regulation.\" YouTube's parent company, Google, has reportedly considered launching a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion in the ban. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.In a speech on Wednesday, exactly a week before the ban kicks in, Wells said teething problems were expected in the first few days and weeks.\"Regulation, and cultural change, takes time. Takes patience,\" she said.Wells said Gen Alpha - anyone under 15 years - were connected to a \"dopamine drip\" from the moment they got a smartphone and social media accounts.Previous generations had dealt with bullying or potentially harmful content but it was limited, she said. New technology meant children today had \"constant access\" with algorithms and notifications \"stealing their attention for hours every day\".\"With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine.\"Tech companies will have to provide regular six-monthly reports on how many accounts they have for under-16s, she said.Under the ban, tech companies can be fined up to A$49.5m (US$33m, £25m) if they don't comply with the age restrictions. They will need to deactivate existing accounts and prohibit any new accounts, as well as stopping any work arounds.The other platforms that fall under the ban are Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X, Twitch, Threads, Reddit and Kick.

Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "India tells smartphone makers to put state-run cyber safety app on new devices22 hours agoMeryl Sebastian & Abhishek DeyGetty ImagesIndia now has over 1.2 billion mobile subscribersIndia has ordered all new smartphones to come pre-loaded with a state-run cybersecurity app, sparking privacy and surveillance concerns.Under the order - passed last week but made public on Monday - smartphone makers have 90 days to ensure all new devices come with the government's Sanchar Saathi app, whose \"functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted\". It says this is necessary to help citizens verify the authenticity of a handset and report the suspected misuse of telecom resources. The move - which comes in one of the world's largest phone markets, with more than 1.2 billion mobile users - has been criticised by cyber experts, who say it breaches citizens' right to privacy.Under the app's privacy policy, it can make and manage phone calls, send messages, access call and message logs, photos and files as well as the phone's camera.\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said in a statement.Amid the growing criticism, India's Minister of Communications Jyotiradtiya Scindia has clarified that mobile phone users will have the option to delete this app if they don't want to use it.\"This is a completely voluntary and democratic system - users may choose to activate the app and avail its benefits, or if they do not wish to, they can easily delete it from their phone at any time,\" he wrote on X. The minister did not, however, clarify how this would be done if the app's functions cannot be disabled or restricted. Launched in January, the Sanchar Saathi app allows users to check a device's IMEI, report lost or stolen phones and flag suspected fraud communications.  An IMEI - the International Mobile Equipment Identity - is a unique 15-digit code that identifies and authenticates a mobile device on cellular networks. The code is  essentially the phone's serial number.In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose \"serious endangerment\" to telecom cyber security.\"India has big second-hand mobile device market. Cases have also been observed where stolen or blacklisted devices are being re-sold,\" it said, adding that this makes the purchaser an \"abetter in crime and causes financial loss to them\".Under the new rules,  the pre-installed app must be \"readily visible and accessible\" to users when they set up a device and its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. Smartphone makers must also \"make an endeavour\" to provide the app through software updates for devices that are out of factories but haven't been sold yet, the statement said. All companies have been asked to give compliance reports on the order in 120 days.Getty ImagesThe order requires all phones manufactured or imported in India to pre-install the app within 90 daysThe government says the move will bolster telecom cybersecurity. A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.Technology analyst Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.\"We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,\" he told the BBC. On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.“Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,\" he says, \"barring in China and Russia”.While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and \"will convey its concerns to Delhi\".India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "US defence secretary says he did not see survivors before follow-up strike on drug boat12 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesDefence secretary Pete Hegseth says that he watched the first of two strikes on the alleged drug vessel on 2 September. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said he \"did not personally see survivors\" before a deadly follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean.An initial strike reportedly left two survivors clinging to the burning vessel, before a second strike was allegedly ordered that left them dead.The 2 September strike has prompted concerns that US forces may have violated laws governing armed conflict. During a cabinet meeting at the White House, Hegseth attributed the strike to the \"fog of war\" in a chaotic situation. The White House has said that a top US Navy admiral, Frank Bradley, authorised the second strike.The Washington Post first reported details about the second strike, which has led to concern from both Democrat and Republican lawmakers.In response to a reporter's question during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said that he watched the first strike \"live\" but quickly moved on to another meeting.\"I did not personally see survivors,\" Hegseth said of the first strike. \"That thing was on fire and it exploded... you can't see anything. This is called the fog of war.\"He added that he learned of Admiral Bradley's \"correct decision\" to sink the boat \"a couple of hours later\".\"We have his back,\" Hegseth said of Bradley.President Trump, for his part, also defended Adm Bradley, although he distanced himself from his decision to strike the vessel a second time, saying that \"we didn't know about\" the follow-on strike.\"And I can say this: I want those boats taken out,\" Trump added.More than 80 people have been killed in a wave of similar strikes across the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific since early September.The Trump administration has repeatedly defended the strikes as a necessary self-defence measure to save American lives from illicit drugs.Watch: \"I did not personally see survivors\", Hegseth says of second deadly boat strikeOn Tuesday, Trump claimed that the strikes have led to a massive reduction in drug trafficking through maritime routes, although he did not provide evidence.US lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum have expressed unease about the 2 September incident, with the Senate Armed Services committee vowing over the weekend to conduct \"vigorous oversight\" to determine what occurred.Adm Bradley - who was commander of the US military's Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike - is expected to appear on Capitol Hill this week. He is now overall commander of US Special Operations Command, having been promoted a month after the 2 September incident.The Geneva Convention forbids the intentional targeting of wounded combatants, saying that those participants should be apprehended and given medical aid. Several experts who spoke to the BBC expressed doubts that the reported follow-up strike could be considered legal under international law. Since the 2 September strike, the US has significantly expanded its military presence in the region, with Trump again on Tuesday vowing to \"start doing those strikes on land\". ",

    "body": "5 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in USUS President Donald Trump has said he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".\"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you,\" he said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Trump said the US would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country\".His disparaging comments came as immigration authorities were reported to be planning an enforcement operation in Minnesota's large Somali community.Officials in the state have condemned the plan, arguing it could unfairly sweep up American citizens who may appear to be from the East African nation.Minneapolis and St Paul, which together are known as the Twin Cities, are home to one of the largest Somali communities in the world and the largest in the US.In his comments on Tuesday, which came at the end of an hours-long televised cabinet meeting, Trump said: \"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, 'Oh, that's not politically correct.' I don't care. I don't want them in our country.\"\"With Somalia, which is barely a country, you know, they have no, they have no anything. They just run around killing each other. There's no structure,\" Trump said.He then turned to criticising Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat and the first Somali-American to be elected to Congress who he has clashed with repeatedly.\"I always watch her,\" Trump said, adding that Omar \"hates everybody. And I think she's an incompetent person\". \"His obsession with me is creepy,\" Omar said in a social media post. \"I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.\"ReutersTrump criticised Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American who represents a Minnesota district in CongressUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, a person familiar with the planning told the BBC's US partner CBS News on Tuesday.Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted when the operation begins this week, the official said. The New York Times first reported the operation.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, declined to comment on planned operations and denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,\" she said.In a news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said that an operation by ICE \"means due process will be violated\".According to local leaders, there are about 80,000 people living there who are originally from Somalia, and the vast majority are American citizens. Tracking the ICE tactics used in Trump's mass deportation driveThe Trump administration has intensified its immigration crackdown in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington DC last week, which killed Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and seriously injured Andrew Wolfe, 24.The suspect, who has been arrested and charged with murder, is originally from Afghanistan. Last week, Trump said on social media that he was planning on ending the Temporary Protected Status - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota. A few hundred immigrants would be affected by that order. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also suggested on Tuesday her agency would target visa fraud in Minnesota. Somalia is one of the poorest nations in the world, and many of the migrants who moved to the US left in the 1990s during the country's decades-long civil war.Local leaders in Minnesota have condemned the Trump administration's reported plan.Minnesota state Senator Zaynab Mohamed said on X that \"when ICE agents interact with Somalis here, they will find what we've been saying for years: Almost all of us are US citizens\". Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election and who has been sparring with the president in recent days, said: \"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoWill GrantCentral America correspondent, TegucigalpaReutersPresidential candidate Salvador Nasralla has a small lead in the electionWith a little over two-thirds of the ballots in the Honduras election tallied, the lead has changed hands.The former vice-president, Salvador Nasralla, has a small but potentially significant lead over his rival, the conservative former mayor of Tegucigalpa, Nasry Asfura. Yet Asfura's National Party continues to brief journalists that they have the numbers for an eventual win.The race remains on a knife-edge. In Washington, President Donald Trump has staked his hopes on nothing less than an outright Asfura victory and has tried to directly influence the race in support of his favoured candidate.Whether it's been intimating that funds could be withheld from the impoverished Central American nation or making unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, many in Honduras see the US president's fingerprints all over this election.To Honduran political analyst, Josue Murillo, it smacks of the kind of treatment Honduras expected from Washington during the Cold War.\"No government should come here and treat us as a banana republic. That is a lack of respect,\" he says in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa.\"Donald Trump saying who we should elect violates our autonomy as a nation, and it affects our elections as well.\"Irrespective of whether the National Party go on to victory, one of their key figures is already celebrating.On Monday, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernandez walked out of jail in Virginia a free man having served just one year of a 45-year sentence for drug-smuggling and weapons charges.His release came after Trump urged Honduran voters to cast their ballots for Asfura.Hernandez was unexpectedly pardoned by Trump, despite having been found guilty last year by a court in New York of running a drug conspiracy which had brought more than 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States.His time in office had also been marred by allegations of serious human rights violations by the police and security forces, particularly against government critics.So, when Hernandez was arrested in 2022, then extradited to the United States and eventually jailed, most Hondurans celebrated it as a rare moment of justice in a nation riddled with institutional impunity, especially for the political elites.Trump has claimed the opposite, telling journalists on Air Force One that \"the people of Honduras really thought (Juan Orlando Hernandez) was set up and it was a terrible thing\".ReutersEx-President Juan Orlando Hernandez was extradited to the United States in 2022Journalists in Honduras who have covered the rise and fall of Hernandez – from the moment he rose to national prominence following a coup in 2009 to his extradition – struggle to recognise that description of a roundly detested former president.However, he does still have his supporters, particularly in the National Party. And none have been more vocal in maintaining his innocence or calling for his pardon than his wife, Ana Garcia Carias.I sat down with the former First Lady, who described Mr Hernandez's release as \"like being in a dream, a dream made reality\".\"We spoke to him this morning (Tuesday) and he is in a safe place. We were so happy, we got all the children onto the phone together with my mother-in-law, and shared a moment of happiness, laughter and prayer together.\"In terms of the future, the question now arises as to whether Mr Hernandez will attempt to return to Honduras. Ms Garcia Carias says that his potential return depends less on the outcome of the election and more on whether the authorities will guarantee his safety.\"It depends on the security guarantees they give him in this country\", she says.\"Day after day, this government – which thank God is on its way out – used a discourse of hate about my husband that they spoke of persecution against him. And that's very dangerous for an ex-president – to return to a place where they've cultivated hatred against him from the very top, the president, down to the lowliest functionary.\"Ms Garcia Carias claimed Mr Hernandez had been a victim of \"lawfare\", of \"the deep state\" and of a \"politically motivated witch-hunt\" by the Biden administration. I put it to her that the case against her husband had largely been drawn up by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the US Department of Justice during Trump's first term, not President Biden's.It was a point she quickly dismissed.\"That's what the prosecutors claimed but I think it's so illogical,\" she argues. \"In whose mind would it make sense to bring a man they say was a co-conspirator into meetings with the CIA, the DEA, to give classified information on national security?\"\"There was a political campaign (against him) involving figures in the Biden administration,\" she insisted, \"and I think there was manipulation of the facts after the event.\"ReutersAna Garcia Carias, wife of the ex-president Juan Orlando Hernandez, says he was a victim of the \"deep state\"Ms Garcia Carias publicly recognised the role of two key MAGA figures in securing her husband's pardon: the influential conservative political advisor Roger Stone – himself the beneficiary of a Trump pardon – and the former Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz. \"They both got involved with the case\", she says. \"I recognise and thank them for their contribution. In fact, I spoke to Mr Stone on his radio programme on Sunday and he said that he had taken a letter from Juan Orlando, which he had written on his birthday to ask for a pardon and delivered it directly to President Trump.\"Meanwhile, the vote count in Honduras carries on into another night.As the ballots continue to be tallied, it should soon become clear whether Trump will get his way in Honduras and see a new ally elected in the country just as he pardons an old one.​​",

    "body": "1 day agoYvette TanVideo shows speed fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseHong Kong's leader John Lee has ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of a devastating fire that killed at least 151 people.Last Wednesday, seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - which had been undergoing extensive renovations - went up in flames. Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future\". Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. \"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Getty ImagesThe fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 yearsSeparately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire. An online petition gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before its contents were wiped.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police, according to local media reports.Asked about this on Tuesday, Lee did not address the question directly but said that \"criminals that commit offences must be taken to justice\". \"I emphasise I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.\"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticised the reported arrests.\"Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire...rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,\" Amnesty International said.Getty ImagesChief executive John Lee said that the committee would be led by a judgeWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died.",

    "body": "2 days agoAleem MaqboolReligion Editor, Travelling with the Pope, BeirutGetty ImagesThe Pope arrived in Beirut on Sunday  Pope Leo XIV has arrived in Beirut a week after Israeli air strikes hit the Lebanese capital.For a man known for being measured and careful in what he does, it seems quite the statement to land in a country so affected by conflict in what is his first foreign trip.The Pope has already spent three days in Turkey and, watching his diplomacy at close quarters, we are learning a little more about how he intends to carry out his duties as both spiritual leader and head of state of Vatican City.Pope Leo's interactions with journalists are gentle and softly spoken, and his words always appear thought out and deliberate.His predecessor, Pope Francis, often spoke at length to reporters, sometimes very passionately and from the heart.But sometimes that meant his aides had the job of risk management, having to explain statements that appeared to be a departure from what the Pope had previously said or a diplomatic faux pas.ReutersAt the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in IstanbulPope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.Getty ImagesPeople of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation.\"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC.\"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says.The Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him.Even Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings.In an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.Getty ImagesWith President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in AnkaraThere are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness. In Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.There will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.Some in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.That day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.Unlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage.Additional reporting by Ghaith Solh",

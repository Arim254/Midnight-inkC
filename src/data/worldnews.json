    "body": "20 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was taken to hospital after being beaten when she was arrested last week, her family says.The 53-year-old human rights activist told them in a phone call on Sunday that she was brought to an emergency department twice after being \"attacked by plain clothed agents with severe and repeated baton blows to the head and neck\", according to the Narges Foundation.There was no comment from Iranian authorities, but they have said she was detained for making \"provocative remarks\" at a memorial ceremony in the city of Mashhad on Friday.The Nobel Committee and award-winning film-maker Jafar Panahi are among those calling for her release.Ms Mohammadi, the vice-president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights.She has spent more than 10 years of her life in prison. Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence on charges of committing \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", which she denied.In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison on medical grounds.She has continued campaigning while undergoing treatment.On Friday, she gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Mashhad for Khosrow Alikordi, a human rights activist and lawyer who was found dead earlier this month in what human rights groups described as \"suspicious\" circumstances.According to the Narges Foundation, eyewitnesses cited by Ms Mohammadi's family said that she was attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents at the memorial, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.On Sunday evening, Ms Mohammadi made a brief phone call to her family and told them that \"the intensity of the blows was so heavy, forceful, and repeated that she was taken to the hospital emergency room twice\", a statement said.\"She emphasised that she does not even know which security authority is currently detaining her, and that no explanation has been given in this regard. Her physical condition at the time of the call was not good, and she appeared unwell,\" it added.The Narges Foundation cited Ms Mohammadi as saying that she was accused of \"co-operating with the Israeli government\" and that they had made a death threat, telling her: \"We will put your mother into mourning.\"The statement said that two other activists detained at the memorial ceremony, Sepideh Gholian and Pouran Nazemi, were also beaten by the plainclothes agents.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters on Saturday that Ms Mohammadi was among 39 people arrested.He said that she and Khosrow Alikordi's brother, Javad, had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".The Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday that it was deeply concerned by what it called the \"brutal arrest\" of Ms Mohammadi and called on Iranian authorities to \"ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\".Jafar Panahi, fellow film-maker Mohammad Rasoulof and more than a dozen other activists said in a joint statement that what happened at Alikordi's memorial ceremony \"was a stark reflection of the worrying state of freedom and security, and, consequently, the inefficiency and lack of accountability of the authorities in today's Iran\".",

    "body": "1 day agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

Syria's state news said two Syrian service personnel were also injured.US President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was \"an ISIS attack\" against the US and Syria and said there would be \"a very serious retaliation\". Syria's president sent condolences to Trump after the attack.On Sunday Trump said two of the injured American personnel have been released from hospital.On Monday, the US Army identified the two  soldiers  killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29. The name of the civilian interpreter has not been released.In a post on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said the attack was \"the result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman\", while a Pentagon official said initial assessments showed the attack was \"likely\" to be carried out by the Islamic State group.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security force.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.The ambush occurred in Palmyra, located in the centre of the country, while the soldiers were \"conducting a key leader engagement\", according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.He added the attack is under investigation.A Pentagon official said: \"This attack took place in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"Trump added that the three injured US soldiers were \"doing well\".Getty ImagesUS and Syrian forces were ambushed in Palmyra in central SyriaUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: \"Let it be known, if you target Americans - anywhere in the world you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"In a post on X, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said the country condemned the attack, and extended its condolences to the families of the victims. Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said: \"I strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist ambush targeting a joint US–Syrian government patrol in central Syria.\"We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.\"Last month, President Ahmed al-Sharaa met with Donald Trump at the White House in a visit that the Syrian leader said was part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.Syria recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.The global coalition is aimed at eliminating the remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.In 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks. The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.",

Only my neighbour gave me some to cover myself. I have nothing left. I've lost everything.\"Another survivor said he wanted to see government trucks at the scene to pump out the water.Moroccan authorities say search and rescue missions are still under way.Experts say the climate crisis is in part responsible for the extreme weather fluctuations seen in the North African state.It has suffered seven years of drought in a row, depleting its reservoirs.

    "body": "20 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersJosé Antonio Kast will be inaugurated as Chile's president in March next yearChile has elected the far-right wing José Antonio Kast to be its next president, after an election campaign that was dominated by themes of security, immigration and crime.Kast beat the governing left-wing coalition candidate Jeanette Jara decisively with more than 58% of the vote in his third attempt at running for president.It marks the biggest shift to the right since the end of Chile's military dictatorship in 1990. Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change. We're going to look for them, find them, judge them and then we're going to lock them up,\" he added.At a gathering of his backers in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.\"I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism,\" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red \"Make Chile Great Again\" cap.\"We've been trying to win an election for years,\" said Belem Valdivieso. \"In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we've experienced problems with insecurity. I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.\"Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.Augustina Trancoso voted for Kast in Sunday's presidential electionChile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.\"Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work. Human rights abuses existed, that's true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.\"Kast's brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.ReutersCommunist Party member Jeannette Jara was the left-wing coalition candidateChile's current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings. Kast's rival Jeannette Jara may have suffered by being seen as a \"continuity vote\".A supporter at his victory party, Francisco Otero, said neither candidate represented everybody perfectly, but that a continuation of the government was seen as \"much worse\".After the result Jara posted that \"democracy has spoken loud and clear\" and wished Kast \"success for the good of Chile.\"\"We will continue working to advance a better life in our country,\" she added.Her supporters fear Kast's election marks a return to Chile's far-right past.\"Kast's family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet,\" Ricardo Herrera said, adding that he lived through Pinochet's dictatorship and it was \"brutal\".Some are sceptical, though, that Kast will actually do what he's pledged.\"Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won't be able to do that. It's physically impossible,\" one voter Hector Lunes said.Ricardo Herrera, who lived through Pinochet's rule, voted for Jeannette JaraKast has also been firmly against abortion, even in cases of rape, and environmental protection policies.His victory will likely be welcomed by investors as he has pledged a free-market approach to economics to shrink the state and deregulate certain industries.This was the first presidential election in Chile where voting was mandatory and registration was automatic for those eligible.This left some voters feeling like they had to pick whichever they say was the \"least-worst\" option.\"I don't know if I'd say the lesser of two evils, but I think Chile needs a change,\" Claudio Sanjuez said, \"and I clearly think Kast could be that alternative\".\"Both candidates were like opposite extremes,\" Cintia Urrutia said, but added she'd hoped for Jeannette Jara who she perceived as more \"centrist\".Kast's victory in Chile follows a string of elections in Latin America that have shifted the region to the Right in recent years – including in Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.He will be inaugurated on 11 March 2026. At rallies, he regularly counted down the days until this date warning undocumented immigrants that they should leave before then if they ever want the chance to return.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersSupporters of José Antonio Kast celebrated his victoryChile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven. But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling. However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an \"emergency government\" would not mean \"authoritarianism\". Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama. Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting. In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela. The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.\"Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,\" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign. He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.\"What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,\" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced \"the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security\".Jeremías Alonso supported José Antonio Kast in the electionKast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity. Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an \"iron fist\" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult. Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited. Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.Gabriel, who is from Venezuela, felt hurt by comments diners made about migrantsFor irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's \"very, very bad economic situation\".He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request. His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. \"I'm basically a ghost here,\" he says.While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.\"Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,\" he said.He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.\"It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.\"He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants. With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business. Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries. Carlos Alberto Cossio says migrant workers are key to his businessHe says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that \"the migrant workforce is very important\".He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.\"Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,\" he adds. Expelling unregistered workers \"will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,\" he warns.Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.\"Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,\" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.",

    "body": "Smooth end to Messi India tour after Kolkata chaos 6 hours agoAbhishek DeyDelhiAFP via Getty ImagesMessi concluded his India tour with an event at a stadium in Delhi on MondayFootball superstar Lionel Messi has wrapped up his three-day India tour in pollution-choked Delhi, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata.On Monday, thousands of fans gathered in a Delhi stadium to get a glimpse of the Argentina and Inter Miami forward.As Messi, accompanied by Inter Miami team-mates Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, strolled on the pitch - kicking balls into the stands, passing with a group of children and signing autographs - the crowd chanted his name.His flight from Mumbai had been delayed due to fog, local media reported, and his itinerary had to be trimmed. On Saturday angry fans vandalised a Kolkata stadium  because they didn't get to see him during his appearance there.Getty ImagesA fan holds a jersey of Messi at the event in DelhiAFP via Getty ImageMessi played football with children at a stadium in DelhiMessi had a packed schedule in India, attending a string of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai since arriving in the early hours of Saturday.Before heading to Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium later that day, he virtually unveiled a 70ft (21m) statue of himself, assembled over 27 days by a 45-strong crew in the eastern city.The tour, however, got off to a disastrous start after angry fans ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch at the stadium.Football is hugely popular in West Bengal state - of which Kolkata is the capital - and thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to attend the event.However, most of them didn't even get to see him as he was surrounded by officials and celebrities on his brief walk around the stadium and then quickly whisked away as the situation turned hostile.Kolkata's The Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\", as fans - denied even a glimpse of Messi - \"vented their anger by indulging in violence\".The ruckus, which made international headlines, cast a shadow over Messi's first visit to India since 2011 for what has been called a 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour'.The event organiser in Kolkata has been arrested, police said, and a city court has remanded Satadru Dutta to 14 days in police custody.Messi's visits to Hyderabad and Mumbai passed off smoothly, with fans sharing their delight at seeing the global icon online and in media interviews.Anadolu via Getty ImagesMessi virtually unveiled a 70ft statue of himself in KolkataGetty ImagesMessi met Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in MumbaiMessi also met several politicians and celebrities - Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan in Kolkata (at his hotel before the stadium fiasco), opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.In between these interactions, Messi could be seen waving to large fan gatherings in stadiums and dribbling the ball with groups of children.There were reports earlier that Messi would meet Narendra Modi in Delhi, but the Indian prime minister left the country on Monday morning on a scheduled visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.Messi's popularity stems not just from his long international career and wide TV coverage of European football - he's record scorer for Barcelona, the team he used to play for - but also the emotional connection that millions of Indians have with what is often called the beautiful game.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "2 days agoJames Cook,JerusalemandRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, IstanbulIsrael said it killed a senior Hamas commander on Saturday in a strike on a vehicle inside Gaza.In a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had \"eliminated\" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.Saad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City. The Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.A local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.The BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident. The IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been \"responsible for the deaths of many soldiers\" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.Saad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October. Israel has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.One of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.He has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.Saturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.Israeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.The first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.The diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.It envisages Gaza being run by the \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Trump.Security would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.The eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\". Many aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.Trump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.",

    "body": "Talks between Ukraine and the US aimed at reaching a peace deal with Russia are continuing in Berlin for a second day.Zelensky and his chief negotiator Rustem Umerov met US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner for five hours on Sunday, joined by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"A lot of progress was made,\" a US readout said. The same team resumed talks on Monday morning.Ahead of the start of the meeting, Volodymyr Zelensky signalled he would give up ambitions to join Nato in exchange for security guarantees.Recognising that \"some partners from the US and Europe\" did not support Ukraine's bid for Nato membership, Zelensky said he was instead seeking strong security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection.\"And this is already a compromise on our part,\" he said on Sunday.Witkoff has travelled to Moscow to hold talks with Vladimir Putin on several occasions, but Sunday's meeting at the chancellery in Berlin was the first time he met Zelensky. Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Alexus Grynkewich was also present at the talks.Several European leaders as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening.At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal presented to the US by Ukraine last week to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.For Russia, Kyiv's membership of Nato is a red line, and Moscow has repeatedly demanded that any ambitions for Ukraine to join the alliance are shelved forever. \"This issue is one of the cornerstones and requires special discussion,\" said the Kremlin on Monday.The US too has repeatedly stated it does not want Ukraine to be part of Nato. But Kyiv fears that a peace deal without watertight security guarantees would fail to detract Russia from attacking again.Before the talks began, Zelensky also addressed the thorny issue of sovereignty over the eastern region of the Donbas, which Russia mostly occupies and which it wants Kyiv to hand over in their entirety.The Ukrainian president said that while he was open to freezing the conflict along the current front line he was not prepared to have his troops withdraw from the percentage of the Donbas they still hold - unless Russian forces did the same in the areas they control. For it to be a fair arrangement Russia would have to withdraw the same distance, Zelensky said. This matter was \"extremely sensitive and heated,\" he added.Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide us with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. Over the weekend more than a million households in Ukraine were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". \"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.",

Cambodia has not been updating its military casualty figure.Cambodia's defence ministry said that Thai fighter jets bombed hotel buildings and a bridge, while Thailand reported several civilians were injured in a Cambodian rocket attack.The four deaths on Saturday bring Thailand's total military death toll since Monday to 15, with 270 others injured. It added that six civilians had also been injured.On Friday, Cambodia said at least 11 civilians had been killed and 59 others injured.At least 700,000 people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.Since then, tensions continued to build.This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.",

    "body": "2 days agoTom McArthurandIlma HasanWatch: Anger and chaos in Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata as Messi leaves event earlyAngry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.ReutersAs it became apparent Messi's appearance had ended, local media say the scene turned ugly Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the incident at the stadium.\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" the chief minister said on X.A spokesperson for Messi said that he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media. A police official told reporters that the event's \"chief organiser\" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the \"private event\".Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata, which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing \"I love Messi\" headbands.Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\"I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said. \"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMessi waving to fans as he arrivedThousands of fans had gathered for the eventKolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.\"For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,\" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.\"Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent. He gives me hope that with talent you can do anything.\"",

    "body": "An eyebrow tip and McDonald's footage: Takeaways from Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing 3 days agoMadeline Halpertin court, New YorkGetty ImagesMr Mangione has watched as the court plays body camera footage from the day of his arrestLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a case that sparked national attention, watched as new testimony and never-before-seen footage from the day of his arrest in a McDonald's was unveiled during a hearing this week.Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges related to the 2024 murder of Mr Thompson, a father of two, as well as federal counts that carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing is focused on the defence's attempts to keep certain evidence out of the trial, which has not been scheduled yet, including items found in his backpack during his arrest and statements he made to officers.During the first two weeks of the hearing, supporters of Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family and Ivy League graduate - filled the back rows of the Manhattan criminal courtroom, some wearing a pin portraying him as a saint-like figure.Prosecutors and Mr Mangione's legal team are expected to question over a dozen witnesses from the day of his arrest, including the employees who spotted him and the police who arrested him.Here is a look at some of the key pieces of evidence discussed that offer a window into Mr Mangione's trial.An eyebrow giveawayThe pre-trial hearing has centred on the small-town McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where officers were shocked to find the high-profile suspect days after Mr Thompson was fatally shot - and hours from the busy Midtown Manhattan crime scene.Witnesses suggested the arrest may never have occurred there if not for one of  Mr Mangione's key features: his eyebrows.During the first day of the hearing, prosecutors played a call to police from a McDonald's employee about a tip from a customer in the restaurant.The employee said the customer thought a patron looked like the suspect in the United Healthcare CEO shooting. The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".New York County District Attorney's OfficeProsecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald'sDozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.A fake name leads to an arrestWatch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald'sIn the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.Bullets, a journal and cash: a peek into Mr Mangione's backpackThe pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.New York County District Attorney's OfficeEvidence found during Mr Mangione's arrestVideo played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.The hearing is expected to continue into next week.",

    "body": "Rachel Muller-Heyndyk and Brandon DrenonThe two students who were killed in a shooting at Brown University have been identified, as the gunman continues to be at large.Students Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov were killed in the attack on Saturday at the Ivy League university in Rhode Island, Providence. Nine others were injured.A search for the shooter in the deadly rampage is back on, after officials detained and released a previous \"person of interest\". In a Sunday evening press conference, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said there was \"no basis\" to keep the person in custody, adding that evidence \"now points in a different direction\".The investigation is ongoing and authorities are searching for additional video evidence that could help them track down the suspect.FBI Director Kash Patel said his agency \"will continue an all out 24/7 campaign until justice is fully served\". Providence Police Chief Col Oscar Perez said during a press conference that investigators did not think the person detained earlier was the individual shown in CCTV footage walking away from the scene wearing all black clothing.Authorities did not say what had prompted them to detain the person in the first place. There is not an immediate threat to Brown or the local community, the university said in a statement. But the university asked \"every member of the Brown community to be vigilant in their own activities on campus\".All remaining in-person exams and classes for the semester have been cancelled.On Sunday, Patel said the person of interest had been detained at a hotel in the town of Coventry in the early hours - based on a lead from Providence Police.At that point, Col Perez said officers were not looking for anyone else and were working with prosecutors to collect evidence.The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.On Sunday, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said one of those injured in the incident was in a critical condition, while seven others remained stable and another had been discharged from hospital.In a post on X, the College Republicans of America released a statement identifying Ella Cook as one of the deceased. \"We are devastated to learn of the loss of our Brown College Republicans Vice President Ella Cook,\" the statement said. \"Ella was known for her bold, brave and kind heart as she served her chapter and her fellow classmates.\" In a statement about the loss of Mr Umurzakov, the Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"The loss of innocent lives as a result of this tragedy is a heavy loss for all of us.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X about Ms Cook: \"There are no words. \"Thinking of her family and friends, especially her parents. God please bless them.\"About the other student killed, Uzbekistan-national Mr Umurzokov, the US ambassador to the country said he was \"deeply saddened by reports of the tragic death\". \"We extend our sincere condolences to Mr. Umurzokov's family, friends, and fellow students and mourn the loss of his bright future,\" Ambassador Jonathan Henick said.Mr Umurzokov's aunt, Karina Gabit, told NBC News that he was an aspiring neurosurgeon who was \"very kind, smart. Attended talented and gifted schools\".In an email to staff on Sunday, the head of Durham Academy, a private school in North Carolina, said one of their alumna, Kendall Turner, was injured in the attack, US media reported. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Kendall, her family, and all members of the Brown University community during this incredibly difficult time,\" said Michael Ulku-Steiner.In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Prof Paxson said some areas of campus were still restricted as police continued their investigations. Around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, she said, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes.Prof Paxson said the families of the two students killed were being supported. \"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" she added. Smiley said an order for residents to shelter was lifted on Sunday.The mayor said he had met with victims and their families in the hospital and was \"overwhelmed\" by their \"courage, hope, and gratitude\".On Sunday evening, the community gathered for a candlelit vigil honoring victims of the shooting. Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump said he hoped the nine injured students \"get well fast\" and paid respects to the families of the two people who died. The attack brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.",

    "body": "'I've grown up in fear': Jewish Australians say rising antisemitism made attack predictable9 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullandTessa Wong,Bondi BeachWatch: BBC at the scene of Bondi Beach shootingBondi Beach is almost unrecognisable. The sun is out but the surf is empty. The usually heaving main street is hushed.Helicopters track overhead. Forensic investigators - bright blue figures in the distance - comb over the crime scene from Sunday afternoon when two gunmen opened fire at an event marking the Jewish festival of Hannukah, killing at least 15 people and injuring more than 40 others.Beach chairs, crumpled towels, wads of clothing, a pair of children's sandals lie in a neat pile at the edge of the sand - all the things people left behind as they fled what police are calling Australia's deadliest terror attack.Nearby, a wall of floral tributes has begun to grow over the footpath. Milling around are shocked locals. Hands cover trembling lips. Sunglasses do their best to hide puffy eyes.\"I've grown up in fear my whole life,\" 22-year-old Jess tells the BBC. As a Jew, this felt inevitable, she adds.That is the overriding sentiment here today – this is shocking for such a \"safe\" country and yet predictable for one that has been grappling with rising antisemitism.\"Our innocence is over, you know?\" says Yvonne Harber who was at Bondi on Monday to mourn the previous day's horror.  \"I think we will be forever changed, a bit like Port Arthur,\" she adds, referring to the massacre in 1996 – Australia's worst – which prompted sweeping, pioneering gun reform.Questions and regretsAFP via Getty ImagesMany Australian Jews say they've been fearing an attack like thisMore than 24 hours on, the Jewish community is still locating the missing and counting the dead.Among them is a prominent local Rabbi, Eli Schlanger, who only a month ago had welcomed his fifth child.\"The family broke. They are falling apart,\" his brother-in-law Rabbi Mendel Kastel told reporters after a sleepless night. \"The rabbi's wife, her best friend, [they] both lost their husbands.\"The youngest victim is a 10-year-old named Matilda, whose only crime was being Jewish,  says Alex Ryvchin, the co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the main body for the Jewish community here.\"A man who I knew well, in his 90s, survived the Holocaust in the Soviet Union, only to be slaughtered standing next to his wife at a Hannukah event on Bondi Beach.\"Mr Ryvchin says he is somehow both numb and distraught. \"It's our worst fear, but it's also something that was outside the realm of possibilities.\"His organisation has been warning about a spike in recorded antisemitism incidents since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. But, Mr Ryvchin says, authorities didn't heed the alarm. \"I know these people. They get up every morning to try to keep Australians safe. That's all they wanna do. But they failed, and they will know it better than anybody today.\"BBC/Isabelle RoddEvidence of the night's chaos lingered on Bondi Beach on MondayFrom the moment news of this attack broke, leaders including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, New South Wales premier Chris Minns and the state's Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon have fielded questions to this effect – why wasn't this prevented?There have been a spate of antisemitism-related offences in Australia recently. A synagogue was set on fire in Melbourne last year, a Jewish MP's office was vandalised and a car was torched in Sydney. A childcare centre in Sydney was also set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti in January. Two Australian nurses were suspended and charged this year after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them. There was also an anti-Jewish protest outside the New South Wales (NSW) parliament in November, organised by a neo-Nazi group. As people began to quietly gather on a grassy slope on Monday in front of the iconic Bondi Pavillion, reflecting on the terror of the night before, Prime Minister Albanese visited to pay his respects.\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil - an act of terror and an act of antisemitism,\" he said later on Monday, before rattling through a list of things he says his government has done to stamp it out.This includes setting up a federal police taskforce to investigate antisemitic incidents, and an amendment to hate crime laws. Hate symbols, including performing a Nazi salute, and terror offences are now punishable with mandatory jail terms.  NSW set up its own state-level task force because many of the recent incidents were in Sydney.  BBC/Isabelle RoddKatherine Pierce is worried about the country's futureBut Albanese's words were nowhere near enough to console Nadine Saachs. Standing side by side with her sister, both draped in Israeli flags, she says the government set the tone in October 2023 on the day after the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas. She points to the official response to a protest outside the Opera House, where some members of the crowd started offensive chants.\"If they had put their foot down straight away this would not have happened. The Albanese government is a disgrace as far as I'm concerned.\"\"They have blood on their hands,\" her sister Karen Sher adds.Down the beach, a young woman kneels, eyes closed, palms up, praying.Katherine Pierce, 26, tell me she's driven from Tahmoor, about an hour and a half away, to commemorate those who died.\"I just feel concern for our country… I think Australia needs to wake up to be honest,\" she says.'Australia has your back''All we can do': Sydney residents line up for hours to donate blood after Bondi attackAs the Bondi community and Jewish Australians reeled on Monday, hospital workers were still desperately trying to heal many of the injured. They include Syrian Ahmed al Ahmed, who was captured on camera valiantly disarming one of the attackers. He was shot multiple times, his parents have told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Police were combing the house where the attackers – now revealed to be a father-son duo, 50-year-old Sajid Akram and 24-year-old Naveed – lived. They also searched a rental property where they are believed to have planned the assault.Other community leaders tried to quell divisions. What connections the attackers might have had are not clear, but police admitted they're worried about reprisals. Authorities have been clear there's also been a drastic uptick in Islamophobia since 7 October.Leaders from every state and territory met to weigh up tougher gun control measures, a lever they pulled the last time Australia experienced something even remotely like this. \"Do we need a gun crackdown like John Howard carried out after Port Arthur? He took leadership on that. Will you?\" Albanese was asked by a journalist on Monday.Getty ImagesMourners gather at the Bondi PavillionThere has also been an outpouring of support.

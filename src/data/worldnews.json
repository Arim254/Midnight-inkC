    "body": "Thirteen people were injured, two critically, after a car crashed into a crowd during a demolition derby in southeastern Australia, police said.The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement.The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another.Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, said on social media on Sunday that nine people remained in hospital and \"all are now recovering\".Earlier, police put the number of injured at nine. They said the ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while a critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was under way, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.In a post on Facebook, Moylan thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

    "body": "2 days agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsNine people have been killed and 32 injured after a stockpile of confiscated explosives accidentally blew up at a police station in Indian-administered Kashmir, police said.It comes just days after a car blast killed several people in Delhi, in what the government has called a \"terror incident\". The explosion happened on Friday evening at Nowgam police station, and the explosives were seized from Faridabad in the northern state of Haryana earlier in the week. The region's director general of police, Nalin Prabhat, said the explosives were being sent for forensic examination - but due to a \"very unfortunate\" mishap during handling they detonated at around 23:20 local time (17:50 GMT).Police said in a statement that it was an accidental detonation, not a terrorist attack. \"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" the police chief told journalists.The police station suffered severe damage in the explosion and adjacent buildings were also affected, he said.Multiple vehicles were \"engulfed in flames and reduced to charred husks, with debris scattered across the site\", according to a police statement. \"The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station,\" a source told Reuters news agency. Most of the victims were police officers, along with forensic personnel, two crime scene photographers, and a tailor who was with the team. Manoj Sinha, the region's Lieutenant Governor appointed by the Indian government, expressed his condolences and said he had ordered an investigation. \"I have ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion. Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam police station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,\" he wrote on social media.",

A man in his 30s reportedly broke into the star's property in Guri with a weapon and threatened the two women.But the 34-year-old singer's agency told South Korean media that Nana - whose real name is Im Jin-ah - and her mother managed to subdue the intruder until police arrived.The actor's mother lost consciousness during the disturbance, and both she and Nana required medical attention, the Yonhap news agency reported.A local detective told AFP news agency that the intruder was attempting to steal valuables and had been detained on charges of aggravated robbery.The suspect reportedly threatened both women and demanded money after breaking into the house.Nana and her mother called the police after restraining the man, who was also taken to hospital for treatment, local media said.Nana rose to fame in 2009 with the popular K-pop girl group After School.The group is no longer active but she has since gained popularity over the past decade as an actor.

    "body": "At least four people have died after two boats carrying nearly 100 migrants capsized off the coast of Libya on Saturday, rescue workers have said.Those confirmed to have died by the Libyan Red Crescent so far were all passengers in a boat carrying 26 Bangladeshi nationals.The humanitarian group did not say whether there were further fatalities among passengers in a second boat which sank while carrying around 70 mostly Sudanese people.The boats were using the central Mediterranean route between North Africa and Italy, which is the \"deadliest known migration route in the world\" according to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM).The boats had set off from Al Khums, a port city in northwestern Libya, the organisation said.The Libyan Red Crescent shared images of its crew administering aid to survivors, as well as black body bags lying on the ground.Hundreds of people die each year trying to make the crossing to southern Europe each year in overcrowded and unsafe boats. More than 1,500 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean in 2025 so far, according to data from the IOM. Around a third of those cases happened off Libya's coast.The North African nation was the departure point for the majority of the almost 59,000 people who arrived in Europe this year via the central Mediterranean route, according to Frontex, the European Union's border security agency. Earlier this week, dozens of migrants who boarded a small boat in Libya were missing and presumed dead after it capsized in the Mediterranean. Seven survivors - from Sudan, Somalia, Cameroon and Nigeria - were rescued after being lost at sea for nearly a week.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.A BBC spokesperson said on Saturday evening: \"We have had no further contact from President Trump's lawyers at this point. \"Our position remains the same.\"In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Sir Craig Oliver, former BBC editor and ex-director of politics and communications for former Prime Minister David Cameron, told BBC Today programme that this is a \"nightmare\" situation for the public broadcaster. \"The problem is that public money could be spent fighting this or settling this,\" Sir Craig said, adding that Trump doesn't \"understand the BBC, how it is funded or how it works\". Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes",

    "body": "A bus driver arrested after three people were killed and another three injured in a crash in Stockholm on Friday has been released.Authorities are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the incident after a bus crashed into a bus stop queue on Valhallavägen street in the Swedish capital.The Swedish Prosecution Authority said on Saturday there was \"no reason\" to keep the driver, who had been questioned by police, in custody but that \"certain investigative measures remain\".The man had been arrested on suspicion of three counts of causing death and three of causing bodily harm. Police said there was no reason to think the incident was intentional. Officials are still trying to establish the identities of the victims. The bus was not in service at the time and no passengers were on board, local media report. The crash happened near the Royal Institute of Technology university at about 15:23 (14:23 GMT).Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones,\" he posted on X.",

    "body": "A man has been arrested in connection with a deadly car bomb attack that killed eight people and wounded 20 others in Delhi last week, authorities have said.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said the car used in the attack, which the government has called a \"terrorist incident\", was registered in the arrested suspect's name.They have accused him of conspiring with the alleged suicide bomber. The suspect was a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities say. The explosion happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks.The agency said it had seized another vehicle allegedly belonging to the suicide bomber for examination. So far, it has interrogated 73 witnesses, including people injured in the blast.The blast outside the historic fort was the first such explosion in the heavily guarded city since 2011.Monday evening's attack took place at 18:52 local time (13:22 GMT) when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a busy traffic signal and then exploded.Within hours of the incident, Home Minister Shah confirmed the explosion had taken place in a white Hyundai i20.Footage from the location showed remains of a charred white car and a number of other gutted vehicles, including an autorickshaw and cycle rickshaws.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the attack a \"conspiracy\", and his government vowed to bring the \"perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors\" to justice.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\".Police on Thursday said they were investigating any links to the recent arrests of seven men by police in Indian-administered Kashmir.Potential connections to the the recent seizure of 2,900kg of explosives from a Delhi suburb were also being probed, police said.The Red Fort is visited by thousands of tourists every day, and was built in the 17th Century. Indian prime ministers use the Mughal fortress as a backdrop for their annual Independence Day speeches.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRuth ComerfordReutersWater levels in Tehran's Amirkabir dam are at 8% of capacity, officials sayAuthorities in Iran have sprayed clouds with chemicals to induce rain, in an attempt to combat the country's worst drought in decades.Known as cloud-seeding, the process was conducted over the Urmia lake basin on Saturday, Iran's official news agency Irna reported.Urmia is Iran's largest lake, but has largely dried out leaving a vast salt bed. Further operations will be carried out in east and west Azerbaijan, the agency said. Rainfall is at record lows and reservoirs are nearly empty. Last week President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed and people may be evacuated from the capital.Cloud seeding involves injecting chemical salts including silver or potassium iodide into clouds via aircraft or through generators on the ground. Water vapour can then condense more easily and turn into rain.The technique has been around for decades, and the UAE has used it in recent years to help address water shortages.Iran's meteorological organisation said rainfall had decreased by about 89% this year compared with the long-term average, Irna reported.\"We are currently experiencing the driest autumn the country has experienced in 50 years,\" it added.Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water.EPA/ShutterstockWomen during the rainfall prayer at the Saleh Shrine in northern TehranThe head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh said dams in Tehran, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi are in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages.On Friday, hundreds gathered at a mosque in Tehran to pray for rainfall.Iranian meteorologists reported there was some rainfall in the west and northwest of the country on Saturday - with video showing snowfall on a ski resort north of Tehran for the first time this year.",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \"overhaul\" state-owned energy companies, after a major corruption scandal engulfed the country's energy sector.Around $100 million (£76m) has been embezzled, anti-graft investigators said, causing outrage in a country where Russian attacks have resulted in crippling power outages.\"Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Energoatom, the state nuclear company at the heart of the scandal, will have a new supervisory board \"within a week,\" he added. Several of those implicated in the scandal have close links to the Ukrainian president.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" Zelensky wrote. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of Ukrhydroenergo, a hydropower generating company, and reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the nation's Gas Transmission System Operator. Two ministers were forced to resign over the corruption scheme and a former business partner of Zelensky was sanctioned earlier this week when the scandal broke.On Monday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the 15 month-long investigation had revealed several members of the Ukrainian government were involved.Some of those implicated in the scandal are or have been, close associates of Zelensky's. Among those alleged to be involved are Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95.Zelensky has previously said he is committed to cooperate fully with the anti-corruption investigation.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" he said on Saturday.\"The full transparency and integrity in the energy sector remain an absolute priority.\"But the scandal has brought Zelensky's commitment to fighting corruption under scrutiny once again. In July, he faced backlash after he signed a law limiting the independence of Nabu and Sap. The outrage was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate their freedom, but the debacle prompted criticism from European allies including France and Germany, while ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressed the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.",

    "body": "2 days agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "7 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsFederal agents have descended on the city of Charlotte in North Carolina as part of US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.Federal immigration authorities carried out nearly 100 arrests in the Charlotte area on Saturday, according to CBS, the BBC's American news partner.Local officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Vi Lyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing \"unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community.Since Trump's return to office he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago to deliver on his promise of \"the largest deportation programme\" in US history.The DHS announced \"Operation Charlotte's Web\" on Saturday, saying \"criminal illegal aliens\" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.Armoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Several church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor. \"We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,\" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.Officials said there are \"a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters\".The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to \"sanctuary policies\".Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a \"certified welcoming city\". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.  \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,\" the DHS said.Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US. DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing. Earlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina. The next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city. Operations in previous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have come under fire over concerns of excessive use of force.",

Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.EPAManzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"ReutersSome protesters paid tribute to Uruapan mayor Carlos ManzoSheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "1 day agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilReutersMarching to the beat of pounding sound systems, thousands of climate protesters have been bringing their message to the gates of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Chanting and singing \"free the Amazon\", demonstrators in host city Belém have been carrying three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas flanked by two grim reapers.Indigenous groups displayed signs reading \"the answer is us\" as an inflatable elephant and anaconda weaved through the crowd under the hot sun.It is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks. The last three took place in countries that do not permit public protest.Prostesters played samba music and sang\"We are holding a funeral for fossil fuels,\" Tuga Cíntia told the BBC. She is from the theatre group Hydra Dance from the Federal University of Pará.\"I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act,\" she said.Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from across the world joined the march in their thousands.As the midday sun intensified, some sought shelter in a petrol station forecourt.\"Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change,\" Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa, a low-lying island extremely vulnerable to climate change, told the BBC.\"We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels,\" Ilan, from the non-governmental organisation 350, who lives in Brazil, said.Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from SamoaSome carried signs reading \"demarcation now\", calling for indigenous groups to be given legal ownership of their territories. Hundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are regarded by experts as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests.Smaller sister protests have taken place around the world including in the UK.Security was tight at the COP30 venue as police with riot shields guarded the entrance.On Tuesday protesters carrying signs broke through security lines at the summit. The incident caused minor injuries to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue.Representation of indigenous voices has been a flashpoint in these talks, some of whom have set up stalls outside the fenced-off COP30 venue to sell products to passing delegates. The meeting was dubbed the \"indigenous people's COP\" but many groups feel their concerns over deforestation, land protection and resource extraction in their homes are not being heard.Negotiations continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday. Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change.Little progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels.President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon.But shortly before the talks opened last week, his government granted permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.On Friday, analysis of attendee lists by the coalition Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies are attending the meeting.A protester with sign reading \"the answer is us\"It suggests 1,600 lobbyists are in Belém, a 12% rise from the COP meeting last year.It is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals. With the US strikingly absent from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation to the talks, after President Donald Trump branded climate change \"a con\".Earlier in the week a group of senior climate leaders wrote a letter calling on the summit to ensure the facts about climate change were \"upheld. Ten countries have signed an initiative called Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change.It aims to create international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote evidence-based information on climate issues.On the core issues of how to tackle the root cause of climate change and how to help countries adapt to ongoing global warming, Brazil has promised the talks will deliver action to implement years of deals and pledges. The talks continue into next week.",

    "body": "1 day agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeReutersPope Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as \"pilgrims of the imagination\", helping to \"bring hope\".The celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the \"troubling decline\" in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a \"great day\", the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate – and for its \"capacity to amaze\".But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called \"the world's wounds\".\"Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated,\" the Pope said. \"Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.\"Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leo's style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Watch: Among the stars to meet the Pope was Spike Lee who had a unique gift for Leo XIV.It's not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall – who came from all over the world – made it onto the Pope's own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, It's a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benigni's multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join today's A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant – of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the \"quiet dedication\" of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.ReutersThe audience for the international filmmakers was held beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the \"beating heart of communities\".\"More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity,\" the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.\"He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people,\" the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress – who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR – placed a woven bracelet in the Pope's hand. \"It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced,\" she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.",

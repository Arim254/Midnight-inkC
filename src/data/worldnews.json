    "body": "11 hours agoBen HattonSonora Public Security SecretariatA fire that broke out at discount shop in Mexico has killed at least 23 people and injured 11 others, local officials say.The blaze broke out on Saturday in the centre of the north-western city of Hermosillo at a branch of Waldo's - Mexico's largest discount chain.Multiple local authorities described the incident as an explosion, though regional Governor Alfonso Durazo said the exact cause had yet to be determined. The Sonora state public security secretariat said it had ruled out the possibility it was an attack or act of deliberate violence against civilians.  Children are among the victims, officials said, with a 15-year-old girl among those taken to hospital.Images from the scene show thick, black smoke billowing from the building, with the flames appearing to have spread to cars parked in front of the shop.After the fire was extinguished, scorch marks can be seen rising from the shop's doors and windows, one of which appears completely destroyed. The car immediately in front of this window is entirely burnt out.\"To the families who lost a loved one... I share your pain and offer you my full solidarity,\" Durazo said in a video address.He added that an \"extraordinary, transparent and thorough\" investigation had been launched to clarify the causes of the incident and determine who was responsible.Sonora state's Attorney General Gustavo Salas Chávez told reporters early on Sunday that most of those killed had died due to \"exposure to toxic gases\".He said there was no indication that the fire had been started intentionally, but added that he could not rule out an investigation into the cause.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on social media: \"My heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives.\"Waldo's shops are a common sight on Mexico high streets, with hundreds of outlets across the country.The fire comes on the weekend when Mexico celebrates the Day of the Dead, where festivities are held for people to honour deceased loved ones.The state government said it was cancelling cultural events planned for Sunday after the incident.",

    "body": "The Kenyan government has confirmed that 21 people have died following a landslide in the western part of the country after heavy rainfall. Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said the bodies had been transferred to a nearby airstrip after the landslide in Marakwet East late on Friday night.He said on X that more than 30 people were still unaccounted for after being reported missing by their families while 25 people with serious injuries had been airlifted to receive further medical attention.The Kenyan Red Cross, which is helping to coordinate rescue efforts, said that the most affected areas are still not accessible by road due to mudslides and flash flooding. The Kenyan government paused the search and rescue operation on Saturday evening but said it would resume on Sunday.\"Preparation to supply more food and non-food relief items to the victims is underway,\" said Murkomen, adding: \"Military and police choppers are on standby to transport the items.\"Kenya is in its second rainy season when it usually experiences a few weeks of wet weather compared to a heavier, more prolonged period earlier in the year. The government has urged people living near seasonal rivers as well as areas that experienced landslides on Friday to move to safer ground.Meanwhile, flash flooding and landslides in Uganda, near the border with Kenya, have killed a number of people since last Wednesday.On Saturday, the Uganda Red Cross said another mudslide had occurred in Kapsomo village in the east of the country, destroying a house and killing four people inside. The Red Cross said floods had severely affected most villages near riverbanks in the Bulambuli District. It said continuous heavy rainfall had caused the River Astiri and the River Sipi \"to overflow, resulting in widespread destruction of homes, crop fields, and community infrastructure\".",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned.\"Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating the ceasefire.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a militant that was posing a threat to its soldiers. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, all the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Prior to Sunday, nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "US airports have been hit with widespread delays because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the federal government shutdown.A ground stop was issued at Newark Airport on Sunday morning, a major hub servicing New York. Average delays at Newark are more than three hours and could last until Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration says.Half of the 30 major airports in the US have staff shortages, and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said flights will be cancelled across national airspace \"to make sure people are safe\".Nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers are working without pay as the government shutdown enters its second month.Air traffic controllers, like other essential federal workers, are required to work without pay during the shutdown, including Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.  The aviation agency called on lawmakers to end the shutdown so that workers \"receive the pay they've earned and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays\". The FAA said the shortages means it has had to reduce the flow of air traffic \"to maintain safety\". \"This may result in delays or cancellations,\" it added.On Saturday, about 4,500 flights within the US were delayed and more than 500 were cancelled, according to FlightAware. In New York, the largest US city, about 80% of air traffic controllers were absent heading into the weekend, according to the FAA.Transportation Secretary Duffy on Sunday told ABC the aviation agency would take any steps necessary to make sure travellers are safe.\"But there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one,\" he said.He added that air traffic controllers were under a great deal of stress and working without pay.\"They don't make a lot of money, and so they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household,\" he said.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\"Lawmakers are at an impasse as a Republican-led bill to fund the government has failed to pass the Senate over a dozen times.In exchange for re-opening the government, Democrats are seeking to extend tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.They are also calling for a reverse to US President Donald Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.",

    "body": "France's consumer watchdog has reported fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website. The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "Three men have been killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said. It is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the Trump administration says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US.Since they began in September, experts have questioned the legality of the strikes under international law, which have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Combatting the flow of illegal drugs is a key policy for US President Donald Trump - but some have suggested the strikes are part of efforts to influence politically opposed governments in the region.Hegseth said the boat targeted on Saturday was operated by a designated terrorist organisation - without specifying which one - and had been travelling in international waters when it was hit.The vessel was travelling along a known drug-smuggling route and carrying narcotics, he said, without providing evidence.Hegseth's statement late on Saturday was accompanied by a video that appears to show a blurred-out boat travelling through the water before exploding.Announcements of these strikes are usually accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration has previously said that some boats targeted had departed from Venezuela.The Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that at least 64 people have been killed by American airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has previously described the attacks as \"murder\" and said they were being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\".The two left-wing leaders have increasingly been at odds with the Trump administration. Following Petro's comments, the US placed sanctions on him and his inner circle, as well as removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs. Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.But this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.However, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied. Others have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law. \"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said. \"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"Experts in Latin American politics have suggested the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.The US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.Washington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterChina will begin easing an export ban on automotive computer chips vital to production of cars across the world as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China, the White House has said. The White House confirmed details of the deal in a new fact sheet after Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in South Korea this week.The nations also reached agreements on US soybean exports, the supply of rare earth minerals, and the materials used in production of the drug fentanyl.  The deal de-escalates a trade war between the world's two largest economies after Trump hit China with tariffs after he entered office this year, leading to rounds of retaliatory tariffs and global business uncertainty.Chinese Embassy in Washington spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC in a statement that details of the agreements reached had been shared by \"competent authorities\". \"China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial in nature,\" he said. \"As President Xi Jinping noted, the business relationship should continue to serve as the anchor and driving force for China-US relations, not a stumbling block or a point of friction.\"Speaking on Sunday following the release of the deal details, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN: \"We don't want to decouple from China… (But) they've shown themselves to be an unreliable partner.\"Much of what is in Saturday's fact sheet was announced by Trump and other officials following the meeting between the two leaders. Trump had described the talks, held in South Korea, as \"amazing\", while Beijing had said they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\".One of the issues addressed in the deal was the export of automotive computer chips. There had been concern that a lack of chips from Nexperia, which has production facilities in China, could create global supply chain issues. Nexperia is a Chinese-owned company, but is based in the Netherlands. About 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The fact sheet states that China will \"take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia's facilities in China, allowing production of critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world\".It follows Beijing saying on Saturday that it was considering exempting some firms from the ban. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover said the lack of chips posed a threat to their business. On other key issues, Beijing will now pause export controls it brought in last month on rare earth minerals - vital in the production of cars, planes and weapons - for a year. The White House also said it would lower tariffs brought in to curb the import of fentanyl into the US, with China agreeing to take \"significant measures\" to deal with the issue. Fentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals, and while it is approved for medical use in the US, the powerful and highly-addictive substance has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.The chemicals used in its manufacturing, some of which have legitimate uses, are mostly sourced from China. On soybeans, China has committed to buying 12 million tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025, and 25 million metric tonnes in each of the following three years - which is roughly the level they were previously at. China's decision to stop purchasing soybeans from the US earlier this year denied American farmers access to their largest export market. In response, Trump revived a bailout for farmers which was in place during his first term in office.",

    "body": "The number of people killed in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa has risen to 28, the Caribbean nation's prime minister has announced.Andrew Holness confirmed nine other deaths on Saturday, adding that there were reports of possible fatalities still being verified - suggesting the figure may yet rise.Emergency responders and aid agencies have struggled to reach certain parts of the island in the aftermath of the storm due to blocked roads, debris and flooding.The category five hurricane - the strongest type - has caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, bringing powerful winds and landslides to Cuba and Haiti.The full scale of the destruction Melissa wrought on Jamaica has only become clear in the past few days as the hurricane knocked out communication systems and power to much of the island after it made landfall on Tuesday.Communities on the island's western portion, such as Black River and Montego Bay, have seen the worst of the destruction.Images have emerged showing buildings razed to the ground, debris and belongings strewn on streets, and whole neighbourhoods still under floodwater.The Red Cross says that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Jamaican officials confirmed to news agency AFP that multiple field hospitals were being established to treat people in the worst-affected areas in the west.Aid reaching those in need was initially held up by the temporary closure of Jamaica's airports. Now that it is arriving in the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating its distribution.With so many in need of clean drinking water, food and medicine, there have been reports of desperate people entering supermarkets and pharmacies to gather what they can.Melissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean.At its peak, the hurricane had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph.At least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.In Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has unveiled renovations to the bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom, as his remodelling of the White House continues.Trump shared photos of the new bathroom on social media, saying it had been \"renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era\".He claimed the new black and white marble is \"very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\".It is the latest change Trump has made to the White House this year. In October, its East Wing was demolished to make way for his new multi-million dollar ballroom.The bathroom is a part of Abraham Lincoln's office and cabinet room, which former President Harry Truman fixed up as a part of his massive renovation of the White House in the late 1940s. The wallpaper of Lincoln's office and bedroom was once coloured in green and gold, according to the White House Historical Association. After Trump's remodelling, it now features gold fixtures and accents for the sink, bathtub faucet and shower door, as well as a chandelier. The White House said the renovation was privately funded at no cost to the taxpayer.The US president's attempts to put his own stamp on the White House have prompted criticism from conservation groups and his political opponents.  Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the East Wing would not \"interfere with the current building\". But in October, he said the \"existing structure\" had to be torn down. Trump said the ballroom construction was being fully funded by him and \"some friends of mine - donors\".Conservationists argued Trump should have sought public review before making the changes, which they say would overwhelm the classical style of the White House. The White House hit back at its critics, saying \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\".Other changes to the White House include his decision in August to pave over grass in the Rose Garden with stone, transforming a lawn into a patio. Trump also added touches of gilded gold all over the Oval Office, including additional portraits framed in gold, gold-framed mirrors and a gold leaf for the presidential seal on the ceiling of the office.In response to his latest bathroom renovation, the Democrats accused Trump of being more focused on remaking the White House than solving the government shutdown.Central to the shutdown, which is now entering its second month, is a dispute over whether to extend health insurance subsidies.\"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on social media.Speaking at an event on Saturday, former US President Barack Obama said Trump has been \"focused on critical issues, like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don't get mud on their shoes and gold plating the Oval Office and building a $300m ballroom\" than resolving the shutdown. \"If you can't visit a doctor, don't worry. He will save you a dance,\" he added. ",

    "body": "24 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkraine's top military commander has admitted his soldiers are facing \"difficult conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were fending off a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.He confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.The defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter - something denied by Kyiv.Gen Syrskyi said in a social media post on Saturday that he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.In a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.It is unclear when or where the footage was recorded.Ukrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday that Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".Late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk. Images shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date of the footage could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but that the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions - collectively known as the Donbas - as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Putin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "4 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in Nigeria3 hours agoJoseph WinterGetty ImagesDonald Trump says he would also cut all aid to NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An advisor to Nigeria's president told the BBC that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".He warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump added: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Trump's threat has triggered alarm across Nigeria. Many on social media are urging the government to step up its fight against Islamist groups to avert a situation where foreign troops are sent into the country.But Mr Bwala, who said he was a Christian pastor, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Trump had a \"unique way of communicating\" and that Nigeria was not taking his words literally.\"We know the heart and intent of Trump is to help us fight insecurity,\" he said, adding that he hoped Trump would meet Tinubu in the coming days to discuss the issue.Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in AbujaMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'I was accused of spying and beaten' - a boy's escape from captured Sudan city2 days agoBushra Mohamed and Akisa Wandera,BBC AfricaAFP via Getty ImagesPeople are arriving in Tawila after having travelled on foot for three daysTwelve-year-old Abdiwahab - not his real name - sobs as he recounts what happened to him as he escaped from the western Sudanese city of el-Fasher.The young boy left el-Fasher on Sunday as it fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that has been fighting a two-and-a-half-year civil war against the army.In a video received by the BBC, his face reflects deep sorrow and fatigue, his voice low as he describes being assaulted \"many times\" by RSF fighters. Fearing reprisal attacks from RSF fighters, Abdiwahab had joined a wave of people - including some of his family - trying to get out.The UN estimates that 60,000 have managed to get out of el-Fasher with many narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape.'We saw people murdered in front of us' - siege survivors speak to the BBCNew videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanAfter three days of walking Abdiwahab reached the relative safety of Tawila - an 80km (50-mile) journey - but he arrived on his own.''I left the city with my father and siblings but because of the chaos we were separated, I came to Tawila alone,\" he says on the video.He was assaulted on the way and accused of being involved in espionage.\"I walked along the road, and on the road, [the RSF] caught me, many times. They beat me and hit me, saying, 'this little boy is a spy'.\"This chimes with other accounts of how men and boys are especially at risk as they face arbitrary arrest, violence and summary execution.Abdiwahab says that RSF fighters had already taken his mother and one of his sisters about a month ago, and he does not know if they are still alive.Ali, not his real name, who is now a volunteer aid worker after fleeing el-Fasher himself a fortnight ago, was the one who filmed Abdiwahab's account.He is stationed at the entrance to Tawila where a temporary camp has been established and where new arrivals gather before being relocated to permanent camps inside the town.In a voice note to the BBC explaining the context, Ali's words were almost drowned out by the noise and chaos at the camp.\"[Abdiwahab] keeps asking me about his parents. I decided to take him home until we found them,\" Ali says.He noticed how the boy was traumatised, fearing that any light appearing at night was an RSF vehicle coming to get him.\"He saw a light in the distance and held me tight, screaming. He froze.\"ReutersAid agencies are overwhelmed by the number of people who need helpAli says each new arrival to the camp carries a story of survival and despair.There are many unaccompanied minors, including children who lost their parents on the road, coming in every day.\"Just yesterday, twin children around 10 years old arrived with a woman who said their parents had died on the way,\" the volunteer aid worker says.\"The situation is terrifying. People continue arriving with many conditions, some with injuries and malnutrition. Those who arrived are begging us to go and save the people on the road, because many are dying trying to come to Tawila,\" Ali says.Survivors spoke of \"passing dead bodies scattered along the road and hearing the cries of the wounded calling for help\".But even relief work has become deadly.Ali says the organisations operating in Tawila are afraid to leave the town after five Red Crescent volunteers were killed in another state earlier this week.\"They are waiting for assurances and confirmation that the situation is safe,\" he says.Many mothers arriving in Tawila are in desperate need of food, water and medical help, according to the charity Save the Children.Some women reported being attacked by armed men on motorbikes and robbed as they fled.\"Women who managed to escape with their children as fighting raged made it to Tawila without food or water. They are now entirely dependent on already stretched humanitarian assistance,\" the aid agency said in a statement.The UN's refugee agency has said it was struggling to find enough shelter and food for civilians seeking refuge in the town.But not everyone is making it out of el-Fasher, where there have been reports of mass killings.This week, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in the city and said they would be investigated. A senior UN official has said that the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.Estimates vary as to how many civilians are still strapped in the city.Save the Children puts it at more than 260,000 people, including an estimated 130,000 children, who have to contend with famine-like conditions, the collapse of health services and no safe route out.More BBC stories on the conflict:Reports of mass killings in Sudan have echoes of its dark pastMy son's whole body is full of shrapnelRare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan cityLast surgeons standing in city's only hospitalBBC smuggles in phones to reveal hunger and fearGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 days agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiGetty ImagesIndia's passport ranks 85th out of 199 countries on the Henley Passport IndexEarlier this year, a video by an Indian travel influencer complaining about India's weak passport went viral on social media.He said that while neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka were more welcoming of Indian tourists, getting visas to travel to most Western and European countries remained a challenge.His dissatisfaction with India's poor passport strength was reflected in the latest Henley Passport Index - a ranking system of the world's passports based on visa-free travel - which placed India in the 85th spot out of 199 countries, five spots lower than last year.The Indian government has not commented on the report yet. The BBC has reached out to the ministry of external affairs.Countries like Rwanda, Ghana and Azerbaijan with much smaller economies than India - which is the fifth-largest economy globally - are ranked higher on the index at the 78th, 74th and 72nd spots, respectively.In fact, India's rank in the past decade has hovered in the 80s, even dipping to the 90th spot in 2021. These rankings are dismal compared to Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and Singapore, which have consistently held top positions.This year, like the last, Singapore topped the index with visa-free travel to 193 countries. South Korea came in second with 190 visa-free destinations and Japan ranked third with 189 countries.Meanwhile, Indian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countries, just like the citizens of the African country Mauritania, which shares the 85th rank with India. Getty ImagesIndian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countriesPassport strength reflects a nation's soft power and global influence. It also translates into better mobility for its citizens, boosting business and learning opportunities. A weak passport means more paperwork, higher visa costs, fewer travel privileges and longer waiting times for travel.But despite the decline in the rank, the number of countries offering visa-free access to Indians has actually increased in the past decade or so.For example, in 2014 - the year Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power - 52 countries offered visa-free travel to Indians and its passport ranked 76th on the index.A year later, it tumbled to the 85th position, then rose to 80th in 2023 and 2024, dropping again to the 85th position this year. Meanwhile, visa-free destinations for Indians increased from 52 in 2015 to 60 in 2023 and 62 in 2024. The number of visa-free destinations in 2025 (57) is higher than what it was in 2015 (52), yet India's rank for both these years is 85. So, why is that?Experts say that a major reason is the increasingly competitive landscape in global mobility - meaning countries are entering into more travel partnerships to benefit their citizens and their economies. According to a 2025 report by Henley & Partners, the global average number of destinations travellers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 109 in 2025.For example, China has increased the number of visa-free destinations its citizens can travel to from 50 to 82 in the past decade. Consequently, its rank on the index has improved from 94th to 60th during the same time period.Meanwhile, India - which was ranked 77th on the index in July (the Henley Passport Index is updated quarterly to reflect changes in global visa policies) as it enjoyed visa-free access to 59 countries - dropped to the 85th position in October after losing access to two countries.Getty ImagesSingapore's passport is the most powerful in the worldAchal Malhotra, former Indian ambassador to Armenia, says there are other factors that affect the strength of a country's passport, like its economic and political stability as well as its openness to welcoming citizens from other countries.For example, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 and now occupies the 12th position - a historic low - because of its increasingly insular stance in world politics, the report says. Mr Malhotra recalls how in the 1970s, Indians enjoyed visa-free travel to many Western and European countries, but that changed after the Khalistan movement in the 1980s, which called for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India and caused internal turmoil. Subsequent political upheavals have further chipped away at India's image as a stable, democratic country.\"Many countries are also becoming increasingly wary of immigrants,\" Mr Malhotra says. \"India has a high number of people migrating to other countries or overstaying their visas and that interferes with the country's reputation.\"Factors such as how secure a country's passport is and its immigration procedures also play a role in gaining visa-free access to other countries, Mr Malhotra says.India's passport remains vulnerable to security threats. In 2024, the Delhi police arrested 203 people for alleged visa and passport fraud. India is also known for having cumbersome immigration procedures and a slow pace of visa processing.Mr Malhotra says that technological advances, like India's recently-launched electronic passport or e-passport, can improve security and ease the immigration process. The e-passport includes a small chip that stores biometric information, making it harder to forge or tamper with the document.But more diplomatic outreach and travel agreements remain key to boosting the global mobility of Indians and, by extension, India's passport ranking.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

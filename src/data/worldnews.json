    "body": "2 hours agoTom McArthurReutersAt least 37 people were killed and dozens injured in Peru when a bus plunged into a 200m (650ft) deep ravine after a head-on collision.The incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a \"rugged\" stretch of the Pan-American Highway that connects Peru with Chile in the country's southern region of Arequipa.Local media say the bus was carrying 60 passengers when it smashed into a pickup truck on a curve, careered off the road and fell down to the banks of the Ocoña River. Bus crashes are common in Peru, especially at night and on mountain highways. This is often due to poor road conditions, excessive speed, and lack of safety signage.The bus, operated by the Llamosas company, was heading from Chala, a town in Caraveli province, to Arequipa. Both drivers reportedly survived the crash, which happened at kilometre 780 of the Pan-American Highway South.Pictures from the scene of the crash show the wrecked bus at the bottom of a steep ravine - its windows completely shattered, bodywork badly damaged and roof caved in.Waldor Llerena, Ocona's district mayor, told radio station RPP that the terrain around the crash site is \"very rugged\", and the area had a history of similar deadly accidents. Public Prosecutor's OfficePolice experts will work out the cause of the crash, officials saidThirty-six people died at the scene and another person later died in hospital, Walther Oporto, Arequipa's regional health chief told local media, citing firefighters at the scene of the crash.Health officials told RPP that 25 people - including three minors - are being treated in a local hospital for their injuries.An investigation into the incident is underway and the driver of the pickup truck has been detained, the Public Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.In 2022, more than 3,300 people died in traffic accidents in Peru, official figures suggest.Stretching from Alaska to the pencil tip of Argentina, the 48,000km-long Pan-American Highway holds the record for the world's longest road navigable by motor  vehicle.",

    "description": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Vol",
    "body": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday. On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country. Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government. According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants. It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created. In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesPennies, which are worth one cent, cost nearly four cents to make.The US is set to make its final penny.The Philadelphia Mint will strike its last batch of one-cent coins on Wednesday, after more than 230 years of production.The coins will remain in circulation but the phase-out has already prompted businesses to start adjusting prices, as they say pennies are becoming harder to find.The government says the move will save money, or as President Donald Trump put it in February when he first announced the plans: \"Rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time\".Pennies, which honour Civil War president Abraham Lincoln and are made of copper-plated zinc, today cost nearly four cents each to make — more than twice the cost of a decade ago, according to the Treasury Department. It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year.Officials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot. The Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, \"far exceeding the amount needed for commerce\".Many pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in, according to a 2022 government analysis.But penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.Other countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012.Australia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006.The UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn. But the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.In the US attention has now turned to the nickel, which has a face value of five cents but costs nearly 14 cents to produce. Retiring that coin would have a far bigger impact on shoppers, costing consumers some $55m per year, according to the Richmond Fed study.",

    "body": "20 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseA US naval strike force centred around the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed. The arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela. The US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government. The aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".Petro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.He wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".In a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November. The force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region. The carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico. Collectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades. The US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Earlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people. In addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process. Colombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups. On Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.Earlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war. In an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\" ",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 11 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesA Danish man has been convicted of sharing nude scenes from copyrighted films and TV series on the social media site Reddit.According to a police document seen by BBC News, the man - who is not named in the document - shared 347 clips of nude scenes on the Reddit group he moderated, which were then viewed 4.2 million times. The Danish police say he has been given a seven month suspended sentence for copyright infringement.Experts say the man was prosecuted under a rarely-used clause in Danish copyright law, with the judge finding that by taking the scenes out of their original context, the man had damaged the artists' \"moral rights\". He has also been convicted of sharing more than 25 terabytes of copyrighted data.From March 2022 to May 2023, the man known as \"KlammereFyr\" on Reddit posted sexually explicit scenes featuring over 100 actresses.He shared them in the subreddit - or forum - he was a moderator of.According to the Danish anti-piracy group The Rights Alliance (TRA), his subreddit had more than 6,000 members and users were encouraged to request for clips of specific actors.In 2023, campaigners reported the case to the police on behalf of the affected actors, directors and producers, which led to the subreddit being closed down.Andrea Vagn Jensen, one of the actresses whose explicit scenes were shared in the group, told the Danish broadcaster DR at the time she felt there was a difference between appearing naked in a film and appearing on Reddit.The actress said the posts amounted to \"abuse\".'An important signal'The man was arrested in September 2024 and pleaded guilty to the charges last month.In a statement following the verdict, TRA head Maria Fredenslund said the ruling sent an \"important\" signal \"that violations of artists' rights has consequences\".The ruling is considered unique in Denmark for its use of the \"moral rights\" section of the Danish Copyright Act, which states an artist's work cannot be used in a way which infringes upon their reputation.Copyright law expert Dr Alina Trapova told the BBC the case was \"rare\" for its focus on the damage to the integrity of an artist, rather than to them economically.How the case could affect other countries is unclear.But she said there may be \"more and more of these actions\" in the future with the growth of artificial intelligence, where \"the integrity of one's work might be tempered with much more easily\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineAt least 19 people have been killed in an air strike on a suspected rebel camp in Colombian province of Guaviare, according to the country's military. The attack targeted a dissident faction of the Farc rebel group, which engages in drug trafficking.Colombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, had in the past been reluctant to use air strikes to hit rebel camps but following the breakdown of peace talks with several of Colombia's armed groups, he gave the green light for the military offensive. The air strike comes after the Trump administration accused Petro of allowing the drugs trade to expand, which the Colombian president has denied. Colombian Defence Minister Pedro Sánchez said that President Petro had authorised the air strike after learning of \"the imminent threat [the group] posed to the population and the security forces\".Sánchez said that the camp belonged to members of a dissident group led by a commander known by the alias of Iván Mordisco.Mordisco once formed part of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) but broke away from the rebel group as it negotiated a peace deal with the government, which he did not support. He is considered to be the most powerful dissident rebel leader in Colombia, whose group engages in illegal mining and extortion as well as drug trafficking. Defence Minister Sánchez described Mordisco as \"one of the most dangerous criminals and drug traffickers\" in the country. During the military operation, the security forces also detained three people and freed three children who had been recruited by the group. The forced recruitment of children by armed groups has been on the rise in recent years in Colombia according to rights groups, which have documented how children as young as nine are kidnapped, or lured away from their parents with false promises. After Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president, was sworn in, he opened peace talks with a number of armed groups in an attempt to make good on his campaign promise to bring \"total peace\" to the country.Mordisco's group was one of those that entered into talks, but they broke down  after six months when Mordisco led a walk-out. The government blames the group for a deadly explosive attack on a military facility in the city of Cali in August.Following that explosion, Petro described Mordisco as \"a drug trafficker disguised as a revolutionary\".Petro is under pressure by the United States to combat drug trafficking.Colombia is the world's biggest producer of cocaine and the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Petro \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity\".Last month, the US government imposed financial sanctions on the Colombian president. Petro in turn has accused the United States government of \"murder\" over the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. On Tuesday, he again expressed his opposition to the US strikes - in which at least 76 people have been killed - and ordered his government to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies.In his post on X, he said that \"the fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".",

    "body": "15 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAlmost a year to the day since French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal was arrested on arrival at Algiers airport, the Algerian presidency has granted him a pardon and allowed him to leave the country.Sansal, 81, has been at the centre of a bitter diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's decision came in response to a direct approach from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.The writer was said to be en route to Germany on a military plane on Wednesday evening, and his release was met with widespread relief.French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Sansal by phone, said France had used respect and calm to bring about his freedom.\"I thank President Tebboune for this act of humanity,\" said Macron.Although Paris had for months sought to lower tensions with Algeria, it was the German president's role that secured Sansal's release because of his good relations with Algeria's leader.Élysée Palace sources told French media that Frank-Walter Steinmeier had acted as a \"trusted third party\" rather than just a mediator.Steinmeier said this week he had asked President Tebboune to pardon Sansal, \"given his advanced age and fragile health\", so the writer could receive medical treatment in Germany.Tebboune said on Wednesday he had decided to respond favourably to Steinmeier's request \"because of its nature and humanitarian motives\". Sansal is being treated for prostate cancer.He was given a five-year jail sentence in July for undermining national unity with remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.The novelist has long been a critic of Algeria's government, which had not responded favourably to France's appeal for clemency.Relations had already been on the slide after President Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.The spat worsened in April when Algeria expressed outrage after one of its consular staff in France was arrested over the kidnapping of a government critic in Paris.The crisis between the two countries was seen as unprecedented in more than 60 years since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.Some French commentators and political figures blamed what was seen as a confrontational stance to Algeria taken by right-wing former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and others on the right of French politics.Algerian minister Sofiane Chaib also blamed Retailleau earlier this year for the \"fabricated spat\".Then at the end of last month a motion by France's National Rally was narrowly passed by MPs opposing a 1968 Franco-Algerian migration accord that granted residency rights to Algerians.Although the move was seen as a potential setback, the decision to replace Retailleau with Laurent Nuñez as interior minister appeared to signal a new mood.\"He has completely changed the way relations with [Algeria] are handled\", ex-diplomat Jean-Christophe Ruffin told French radio.Retailleau responded to Sansal's release on Wednesday speaking of \"immense relief and great joy\".Tensions between the two countries remain, though, after French sportswriter Christophe Gleizes was jailed for seven years in July for allegedly trying to interview a member of a movement designed by Algeria as a terrorist group.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot praised diplomats for their work in securing Sansal's release, and said they remained focused on Gleizes, \"whose imminent release we are hoping for\".",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again1 day agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDavid Gritten and Sebastian Usher,JerusalemReutersDonald Trump has repeatedly asked for a pardon for his close ally Benjamin NetanyahuIsrael's President Isaac Herzog has received a letter from US President Donald Trump formally urging him to \"fully pardon\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.In the letter, Trump writes that he \"absolutely\" respects the independence of Israel's justice system, but that he believes Netanyahu is facing \"a political, unjustified prosecution\".Herzog's office said he held Trump \"in the highest regard\", but that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu, but he has previously thanked Trump for similar calls he has made in speeches and on social media.In 2020, Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial.In the first case, prosecutors have alleged that he received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours.He is accused in the second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage.And in the third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents.Last month, after helping to broker the ceasefire in Israel's two-year with Hamas in Gaza, Trump said Herzog should pardon his close ally in a seemingly off-the-cuff remark during a speech to the Israeli parliament.\"Cigars and Champagne, who the hell cares about that?\" he asked.In his letter to the president, Trump writes: \"As the Great State of Israel and the amazing Jewish People move past the terribly difficult times of the last three years, I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.\"He adds: \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that this 'case' against Bibi [Netanyahu], who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political, unjustified prosecution.\"The response from Herzog's office is diplomatic, saying that he \"holds President Trump in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciation for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel\".It also politely points out that \"anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures\".According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute their sentence\".However, the High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president could pardon an individual before they are convicted, if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.A pardon would also need to be requested by the accused or a close relative.There has been no public indication of this so far, although there is speculation in the Israeli media that this could happen.Israel GPOIsrael's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, urged Herzog to \"listen to President Trump\", saying Netanyahu's trial had \"become an indictment against the prosecution itself, whose carelessness and crimes are revealed in court every day\".However, Israel's opposition leader and former prime minister, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: \"Reminder: Israeli law stipulates that the first condition for receiving a pardon is an admission of guilt and an expression of remorse.\"He later told Israel's parliament: \"There comes a moment when people must tell themselves... we must also say 'no' to an American president. We are a sovereign country; there's a limit to interference.\"For Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters, a pardon has long been sought since his trial began.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.It was fears that this was under attack with the government's plans for judicial reforms that brought hundreds of thousands out onto the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 that triggered the Gaza war.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoSarah Rainsford,Eastern and Southern Europe correspondent and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later, he said. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told, according to Ansa news agency. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling him: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"Italian prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.However, members of the British forces who served in Sarajevo in the 1990s have told the BBC that they never heard of any so-called \"sniper tourism\" during  the Bosnian conflict.They indicated that any attempts to bring in people from third countries who had paid to shoot at civilians in Sarajevo would have been \"logistically difficult to accomplish\", due to the proliferation of checkpoints.British forces served both inside Sarajevo and in the areas surrounding the city, where Serb forces were stationed and they saw nothing at the time to suggest that \"sniper tourism\" was taking place.One soldier described the allegations that foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians as an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "How the Japan PM's Taiwan remarks provoked the fury of China21 hours agoKoh EweEPA/ShutterstockJapanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan could respond with its self-defence force if China attacked TaiwanOver the past week, China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words.It all started when Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that if China attacked Taiwan then Japan could respond with its own self-defence force.Since then, foreign ministries on both sides have lodged serious protests with the other, and a Chinese diplomat made what some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of Taiwan.Here's what to know.What happened? A timelineThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.Takaichi's remarks drew ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".On Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".While the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.Tokyo has lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing has lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.On Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful commenting on specific scenarios from now on.A long history of animosityThere is a longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.Historical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, Shinzo Abe's protege, suggests more tensions may lie ahead.The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.Getty ImagesThe US and Japan have been deliberately ambiguous on how they would respond, should China invade TaiwanTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.Why Takaichi's recent comments caused such a stirThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.This is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\"",

    "body": "21 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondentBenjamin BegleyChina is facing a number of economic challenges and its government wants the next generation of consumers to start spending more for the good of all, but it is not having much luck convincing them to do so.Officials say insufficient domestic consumption across much of society is dragging on growth, but recent graduates have more reasons than most to be cautious.Youth unemployment has been hovering at just under 20% for some time, those who have jobs fear they could lose them, and the ongoing property crisis can make the prospect of home ownership seem unreachable, especially in big cities.This uncertainty is encouraging many of China's youth to instead embrace frugality, and social media has been flooded with tips on how people can survive on small amounts of money.\"My work is dedicated to a minimalist way of life,\" one full-time influencer tells the BBC.Videos by the 24-year-old, who goes by the online name Zhang Small Grain of Rice, feature content like her using a bar of ordinary soap for all her personal cleaning requirements, rather than expensive skin cleansing products.She can also be seen walking around shopping areas and showing off various bags and items of clothing which she says are good value because they'll last longer.Companies pay her to feature their goods to her 97,000 followers on the Xiaohongshu site. \"I hope more people will understand consumption traps so they can save. This will reduce their stress and relax them,\" she said.Others focus on budget eating.A 29-year-old using the name Little Grass Floating In Beijing posts videos of himself preparing basic dishes. He says he can have two meals for a little over $1 (76p).\"I am just an ordinary person from the countryside. I have neither a good educational background nor a network of influential contacts, so I must work hard for a better life\", he tells his followers.He works for an online sales firm and claims his extremely modest lifestyle has enabled him to save more than $180,000 over 6 years.Some have asked him online if he would expect his future wife and children to live the same way and what the end goal is. His response: \"I don't know\".Some young Chinese people are saving money by cutting down on how much they spend on foodChina has developed a reputation for being an unstoppable economy, able to ride out the turmoil of the pandemic and US President Donald Trump's trade war. But analysts say it will face significant long-term challenges if it does not boost domestic spending.While the US has a problem with people racking up credit card debt, in China it's the opposite challenge. People are already inclined to save rather than spend and this only increases when there are perceptions of tough times ahead.The Chinese government has been promising for years to increase household consumption but it still accounts for only around 39% of gross domestic product (GDP), as opposed to about 60% in most developed countries.Part of the problem is that today's youth are more pessimistic than in the 1990s and early 2000s.\"Right now, making money is more important to me. I actually need to expand my income sources and cut my costs,\" a young woman in central Beijing tells the BBC.Like many other young people, her salary has been cut, she adds.\"I changed jobs, and it doesn't pay as well. Also, I don't know for how long this new job can sustain me in the future. A bad economic environment like this makes people feel down because we're not earning very much. Finding a job in the first place also isn't easy.\"This level of youth unemployment - apart from spreading insecurity - makes it easier for struggling employers to cut wages because workers face a choice of accepting lower pay or diving into a highly competitive job market.A young man, also in his 20s, says there are low-level jobs available but it's hard to find decent work in one's area of expertise.\"Some of my friends are unemployed, still living at home and looking for a job,\" he says.\"They had all kinds of majors at university from financial services to product sales. The economy is a bit off right now. I hope it gets better so we can all have a better life\".And how does he rate the chances of this happening soon? \"I'm not very optimistic,\" he admits.A big concern for China's recent graduates is that the country is making a difficult transition from being a mass producer of cheap goods to a high-tech economy.  And many of these new industries don't require as many workers.Economist George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University,  has been tracking this phenomenon.He cites figures from two big recruitment firms in Beijing showing a high level of university graduates, even with master's degrees, taking jobs as delivery drivers. \"It reflects the skills mismatch between the qualifications which people are leaving higher education with and what's out there in terms of demand for labour,\" he says.\"Of course, that's not being helped by the push to become a champion in robotics and AI because, at least for the time being, this is something of a dampener on job opportunities. Tech isn't really that labour intensive.\"Youth unemployment remains high in ChinaHelena Lofgren has been studying China's consumption patterns for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and believes its economy is relying too heavily on pouring money into preferred industries and focusing on selling products overseas in a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty.\"People save more than they consume, and you need consumption to make up a bigger share of the economy than it's doing today in China,\" she says.\"You have a very export-oriented and investment driven economy and what we see now is that these parts are too big for the economy to stay healthy.\"It is all about economic imbalance. If, for example, China suddenly lost significant export revenue would it have the tools to counter this by financially empowering its enormous domestic population?Some observers have questioned how serious the Communist Party is about increasing domestic consumption.In recent decades, the country has thrived on an investment and export model but that approach is now facing a big challenge: deflation. Would-be customers are often waiting for the price of goods to fall.If a young couple wanted to buy, say, a new lounge suite, it may make sense for them to wait to get a better deal.The longer they, and many more like them, hold off from making big purchases, the more likely companies are to cut prices, leading people to wait even longer for an even better deal.It may seem like a good idea to have cheaper goods, but deflation can force firms out of business and drag on growth overall.This could be countered by somehow fuelling optimism amongst 20 or 30-something consumers. Building a better social safety net or increasing minimum wages might help.There have been some attempts to do this by offering incentives to replace old cars, home appliances and other items but it has not significantly lifted consumption.The influencer Zhang says being cautious with spending runs deep in her country's culture.\"My grandfather's generation was very frugal, very thrifty. It is part of Chinese tradition. For Chinese people to be economical is in their bones,\" she says.",

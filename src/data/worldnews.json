    "body": "6 minutes agoReutersRachel Muller-HeyndykA person of interest has been detained in connection with a US shooting at Brown University that left two people dead, police said.Nine others were injured when a gunman opened fire at the university in Providence on Saturday.Police confirmed on Sunday a person had been detained, and an earlier order for people on the Brown campus and surrounding areas to shelter had been lifted.Of those injured, medics said one person was in a critical condition, six were \"critical but stable\" and two others were less severely hurt.The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing on Saturday that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.Police had earlier released CCTV footage of a male suspect walking away from the scene wearing all black clothing. Officers said a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building.",

    "body": "What we know so far about the Brown University shooting2 hours agoTom McArthurWatch: Police release CCTV of Brown University shooting suspectPolice are searching for a gunman who shot dead two students and injured nine others at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.Police say the attacker was a man dressed all in black who fled on foot, and a shelter-in-place warning is in effect for the area surrounding the prestigious university.The attack on the campus brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 for this year, according to the independent analysis website Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.Here's what we know:What happened?The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.Final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting, the school said.Barus and Holley engineering building is a seven-story block that includes 117 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and three lecture halls.An economics professor told local public media outlet Ocean State Radio that the shooting had taken place during a review session for her course, which was led by her teaching assistant.\"He said that the shooter came in the doors, yelled something - he couldn't remember what he yelled - and started shooting,\" Rachel Friedberg said.\"Students started to scramble to try to get away from the shooter, trying to get lower down in the stadium seating, and people got shot,\" she added.Two students studying in the nearby Rockefeller library when the active gunman alert came through told the BBC they \"stayed away from the windows\" as they awaited police escort.Officers searched the floor, made them drop their bags and raise their hands before before being led out of the library, the pair said.Brown University, one of the one of the oldest higher education institutions in the US, is part of the Ivy League, a group of elite universities in the northeast of the country.The university, which has more than 11,000 students, is located in Providence, Rhode Island's capital city, located about 50 miles (80km) from Boston and 180 miles (290km) from New York City.Who are the victims?Two students were killed, and a further nine people are being treated. Medics say one person is in a critical condition, six are \"critical but stable\", and two others are less severely hurt.The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.\"This is a day that we hoped never would come to our community. It is deeply devastating for all of us,\" she said in a statement.A ninth victim did not suffer a gunshot wound, according to police, who said they suffered non-life threatening injuries from fragments from the shooting \"that had occurred near them\".Who is the gunman?Very little is known about the gunman so far, but police have released CCTV footage of a male suspect, walking away from the scene of the shooting wearing all black clothing.There is no weapon visible in the video, and his face is covered. Officials also say a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building on Saturday.Investigators do not yet know if the gunman was a student, but Providence Deputy Police Chief Tim O'Hara said the suspect was a male who was dressed all in black and appeared be in his 30s.\"We're utilising every resource possible to find this suspect,\" he said.Some witnesses reportedly told officers he may have been wearing a camouflage grey mask.One person was arrested before police determined they were not involved in the shooting and released them.What is the latest?A massive operation involving police and federal agents is now underway in Providence as around 400 officers try to locate the suspect.Residents and students near to the university have been told to stay at home and stay inside, or to stay away until the shelter-in-place is lifted.Students in the area told the BBC they planned to stay at home until the things calm down and the gunman is caught.US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters as he returned to the White House from attending the annual Army and Navy football game, described the shooting as \"a terrible thing\".\"All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt,\" he said.Additional reporting by Pratiksha Ghildial",

    "body": "One million households without power in Ukraine after Russia attacks energy grid24 hours agoAlex BoydState Emergency Service Of UkraineA firefighter works at the site of a Russian strike in OdesaMore than a million households are without electricity in Ukraine after a barrage of overnight Russian strikes hit energy and industrial infrastructure, officials said.Ukraine's internal affairs minister, Ihor Klymenko, said five regions were hit and at least five people were injured, and work was under way to extinguish fires and restore supplies.While Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have been common throughout the war, Moscow has intensified strikes as the country heads into winter.It comes as US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for more talks on ending the war.Steve Witkoff, who has been leading White House attempts to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, will discuss the latest version of the proposed peace agreement in Berlin.On Saturday, Zelensky said more than 450 drones and 30 missiles were used by Russia in overnight strikes. Klymenko said the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Chernihiv regions were hit.Russia's defence ministry said it used weapons including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in the strikes - which are hard to track as they can change direction mid-flight.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all offsite power overnight \"due to widespread military activities affecting the electrical grid\", but is now reconnected. The plant is in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. It is not operating, but relies on a constant power supply to cool its reactors.In Russia, regional governor Roman Busargin said two people were killed in Saratov after a drone strike hit a residential building.The Trump administration is pushing for a deal to end the war to be in place by Christmas and has held several rounds of talks with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in recent weeks, though there has been little sign a breakthrough is imminent. It has not yet been confirmed which European leaders will attend the Berlin talks.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of the meeting, said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would all take part. The Witkoff-Zelensky meeting comes after Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, the latest iteration of a proposal which first emerged in late November and has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity.The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.Zelensky has reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a \"special economic zone\".The Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.\"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" said Zelensky.In public, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have described the US-led talks as fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged. But there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.In a scathing interview with Politico earlier this week, the US president labelled European leaders \"weak\" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.Zelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.On Friday, EU nations agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets held in Europe. It is hoped the agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.Officials are still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government particularly sceptical due to its legal exposure as the main holder. Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion, but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, Vilnius, LithuaniaWatch: BBC captures celebrations as Belarus frees political prisonersRumours of a major prisoner release from Belarus had been swirling for a couple of days.But no one would reveal the names on the list, or the exact number, until everyone was safely out, finally free.In total,123 political prisoners have been released, including some of the best-known names among Belarusian opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.Maria Kolesnikova, the protest leader with a famous red-lipsticked smile, was on the release list.A video of her jumping for joy and hugging other former prisoners, overjoyed to be reunited, was soon flying around social media. Then came another, on a bus out of Belarus, where she thanked everyone who'd helped bring this moment about.\"It's a feeling of incredible happiness to see those who are dear to me, to hug them and realise we are all free,\" Masha, as she's best known, told the camera, her lips already painted red again.The first sunset of her freedom was a thing of great beauty, she said.\"But I also think of those who are not yet free and I await the moment when we can all embrace, when all are free.\"ReutersMaria Kolesnikova (centre) was among more than 100 prisoners handed over to UkraineOut too is Viktor Babaryka, a banker who tried to run for president in 2020 but was locked up before the elections even began.The Nobel Peace prize winner Ales Bialiatski has also been released from a 10-year sentence.All were imprisoned for their opposition to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, whose security forces crushed the mass protests of 2020 with brutal force. They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.EPA/ShutterstockNobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski was one of the prisoners releasedThe dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. \"I've just spoken to Masha,\" she told me after a video call.A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her sentence in solitary confinement, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.\"She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it,\" her sister said.Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.'Optimism and activism'The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.\"Lukashenko's idea, who else?\" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.So has the US gone too far, I wondered.\"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.\"But this is how negotiation goes,\" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.\"President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks.\"A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional,\" he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: \"I want to see my wife!\"She's on her way, I was told.Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many hundreds of people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.\"It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them.\"Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.\"Optimism and activism,\" Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. \"Never give up!\"",

    "body": "1 day agoBrandon DrenonHouse Oversight CommitteeUS President Donald Trump was among several prominent figures featured in the images released on Friday Democratic US lawmakers have released two new batches of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing details of the convicted paedophile's home and ties to the rich and powerful.US President Donald Trump, former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon are among the high-profile figures featured in the photos. The images, many of which have been seen before, do not imply wrongdoing.The nearly 100 photos released by members of the House Oversight Committee on Friday are some of more than 95,000 images obtained via subpoena, the Democrats said.The justice department is separately approaching a deadline next week to publish all Epstein-related documents.Watch: Massie and Garcia on latest photos from Epstein estateIn the first batch of photos released on Friday by lawmakers, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Trump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.Another showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available.A third photo showed Trump smiling with several women, whose faces have also been redacted, flanked on either side of him.An additional photo showed an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: \"Trump Condom\".The White House called the release a \"Democrat hoax\" against Trump that has been \"repeatedly debunked\". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.House Oversight CommitteeHouse Oversight CommitteeFriday's files also include private images of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with several other prominent people including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates.One photo featuring Clinton shows him standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the disgraced financier's abuse.Two other people the BBC has yet to identify are also in the image, which appeared to have been signed by Clinton.Clinton has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In 2019, a spokesperson said he \"knows nothing about the terrible crimes\" Epstein pleaded guilty to.One image included in Friday's batch was a cropped section of a picture originally taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, which showed King Charles in conversation with Microsoft founder Gates at a London summit.The image contained in Epstein's collection was cropped to show only Andrew and Gates.Andrew, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein, was stripped of his \"prince\" title and left his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, earlier this year. He has denied any wrongdoing.House Oversight CommitteeThe cropped section of the image, showing Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorGetty ImagesThe original image, taken by a photographer working for Getty ImagesFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also seen in some of the images. In one, he is shown speaking with Epstein at a desk, and in another, standing beside him in front of a mirror.A third image shows him speaking with filmmaker Woody Allen.Other prominent figures who appear in the images include US economist Larry Summers, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Not all the images show those individuals in the company of Epstein.No additional context or details were included, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom, including images from what appear to be Epstein's estate in the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls, a scene which featured in a previous release of Epstein files.There is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: \"Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again.\"House Oversight CommitteeRepublicans, who are in the majority on the House Oversight Committee, have accused Democrats of \"cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump\".In a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW,\" he added.House Oversight CommitteeEpstein's connection to multiple high-profile figures, along with various unanswered questions about the case, and his 2019 suicide in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, has fuelled online conspiracies and demands for greater transparency around the investigations into the billionaire financier.Following months of pressure from across the political spectrum, the justice department has until 19 December to release all documents related to the Epstein case as required by a bill passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by Trump in November.That upcoming deadline is separate from the congressional investigation into the Epstein case.Friday's publications mark the second time in a month that Democrats on the committee have published new images from its inquiry into Epstein.They originally released 19 images on Friday morning before publishing another nearly 80 later in the day, saying in a statement: \"In the interest of transparency, we will continue to release photos from the Epstein estate.\"House Oversight CommitteeTrump was asked about the new photos on Friday evening and told reporters that a lot of people knew and were photographed with Epstein, calling the release \"no big deal\".Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, but according to the president, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has also previously said that Trump booted him from his Florida resort for \"being a creep\".Watch: \"I know nothing about it\", says Trump on recent Epstein photos released",

    "body": "'A nightmare' - The battle over Warner Bros is turning Hollywood upside down 12 hours agoRegan MorrisHollywoodGetty ImagesDisaster, catastrophe and nightmare. That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).\"David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,\" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. \"Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.\"If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said \"it's imperative that CNN be sold\".The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic. Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount, another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is \"superior\" to the Netflix deal.Getty ImagesWhether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.\"I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,\" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims \"greed is good\" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.\"Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,\" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. \"He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.\"Warner Bros objected to that characterisation. \"Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,\" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC. For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.\"Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,\" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.\"I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,\" he says.Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered \"the talkies\" in 1927.\"I think it's a disaster,\" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. \"This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore. That's scary. It's a nightmare.\"Many theatres in the US refuse to screen Netflix movies because of their streaming-first strategy.\"At least with Paramount, we know movies will make it to the big screen. They didn't kill movie theatres,\" said one producer who has worked for all three companies.Netflix has sought to alleviate those fears, saying they expect \"to maintain Warner Bros' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.\"Many in Hollywood want to believe them.Getty ImagesJohn Evans, a sound technician who dabbles in acting, writing and producing, points to Netflix's loving restoration of The Egyptian Theatre along iconic Hollywood Boulevard as a sign of their good faith.The Egyptian, a classic 1922 theatre, was the site of the world's first movie premiere – Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks – and had fallen into disrepair before Netflix bought the property in 2020 and gave it a $70m makeover.\"I think it's a good sign,\" Mr Evans said, adding that streaming is how many film workers consume movies and TV like the rest of the world.On the backlot at Warner Bros, tourists snap selfies in front of the Central Perk cafe set from Friends, and stroll by facades of buildings that stand-in for New York or Los Angeles. Inside the offices and writers' rooms, for those still working, it's business as usual.\"I've gone through seven mergers,\" a producer working on the Warner Bros lot said while developing a new show, explaining it's sad to lose a studio because it means it will be even harder to get shows made and sold with one less customer. \"But if you make good stuff, you make good stuff.\"The producer spoke on the condition of anonymity on the day that Paramount Skydance announced their hostile takeover bid. They said they were too busy to worry about the sale because they were trying to get a show on air – and they wouldn't be surprised if another billionaire or trillionaire made another offer for the studio by the end of all this. \"I joke about Elon walking in and doing this, but he could,\" they said of the Tesla and X owner. \"When you have people worth a trillion dollars, there are no rules.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoAndré Rhoden-PaulAFP via Getty ImagesIranian security forces have \"violently arrested\" Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her foundation has said. The Narges Foundation said Ms Mohammadi, 53, was detained in the eastern city of Mashhad, along with other activists. The Nobel Committee said it was \"deeply concerned by today's brutal arrest of Narges Mohammadi\" and called on the authorities \"to immediately clarify Mohammadi's whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\". Iran does not appear to have commented.  Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently. The brother of the lawyer witnessed her arrest at the memorial.\"This act is against human rights laws, and amounts to some kind of revenge. \"This happened in Mashhad today and is concerning because the establishment's crackdown has intensified recently.\"Ms Mohammadi had recently accused the Iranian authorities of intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel. Last week she wrote an article for Time magazine about the Iranian state controlling all aspects of personal or public life. \"Their peace is disrupted by surveillance, censorship, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the constant threat of violence,\" she said. She had also told the Nobel Committee she had received warnings from \"agents of the regime\" through indirect channels and her lawyers. \"The threats conveyed to Ms Mohammadi make it clear that her security is at stake, unless she commits to end all public engagement within Iran, as well as any international advocacy or media appearances in support of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression,\" the Nobel committee's statement added.Over the past year, she has continued to remain defiant, refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf and meeting fellow activists across the country.Across her lifetime, Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and been sentenced to more 36 years imprisonment and 154 lashes, according to her foundation.

    "body": "2 days agoZoya Mateen & Azadeh MoshiriDelhiJio StudiosDhurandhar stars Ranveer Singh as an Indian spy on a dangerous mission in PakistanA new Bollywood spy film is generating praise - and unease - in India and Pakistan for its contentious portrayal of the longstanding hostilities between the South Asian neighbours.Dhurandhar, which hit cinemas last week, plunges audiences into a high-octane world of espionage, gang wars and patriotic fervour.Anchored by Bollywood star Ranveer Singh's swaggering performance as Hamza, an Indian spy on a perilous mission in Karachi in Pakistan, the film traces his battles against criminal networks, shadowy operatives and personal demons - all framed against the backdrop of India-Pakistan tensions.While the action-packed sequences and riveting plot have earned praise from many viewers, the film, directed by Aditya Dhar, has also provoked sharp debate over its political messaging and treatment of historical events.Dhar first gained national attention in 2019 with his debut Uri: The Surgical Strike, a dramatisation of India's 2016 airstrikes on Pakistan. The film was a major box-office hit and earned him a national film award.Though Dhurandhar is only his second directorial effort, he has co-written and produced other films, including last year's Article 370- about the 2019 revocation of Kashmir's autonomy - which was a major success and earned praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dhurandhar, arriving months after the worst India-Pakistan military clash in two decades, sees Dhar return to the political-thriller genre on a grander scale.Deadly fights erupt in cramped rooms, gunfire rattles through crowded alleys, leaving behind trails of bodies, and torture scenes linger uncomfortably long. The violence is graphic and filmed in tight, suffocating frames that heighten the sense of discomfort.Online, praise and criticism have flown in equal measure - some are impressed by the film's cinematic ambition and exhilarating plot, others find its hyper-nationalist tone and use of violence unsettling and inflammatory.Jio StudiosMost of Dhurandhar is set in Karachi and claims to tell the story of the gang wars rampant thereThe debate has grown so heated that some reviewers faced backlash, with Dhurandhar supporters accusing them of judging the film through political bias rather than cinematic merit.The Film Critics' Guild, an association of critics, issued a statement this week condemning \"the targeted attacks, harassment, and hate directed toward film critics for their reviews of Dhurandhar\".But despite the polarised reactions, the film has been drawing large audiences and has already become one of the year's biggest hits.The trend is not surprising. In recent years, Indian cinema has seen a surge in nationalist blockbusters that openly reference government policies and historical events.Films such as The Kashmir Files and The Kerala Story have become major commercial hits despite sparking intense debates over their historical accuracy and political messaging.Spy thrillers have also long featured prominently, often portraying Pakistan as the biggest threat to India - a familiar trope rooted in decades of geopolitical tension between the two countries.The makers of these films argue that they resonate with audiences because they address historical events and contemporary issues often overlooked by mainstream commercial cinema - sensitive, polarising subjects that touch on communal identity, national memory and contemporary politics.\"My films are not political, they are of human interest,\" Sudipto Sen, director of The Kerala Story, told the BBC last year. The 2023 film claimed to tell the \"true story\" of Hindu and Christian women lured into converting to Islam and joining the Islamic State (IS) group.But critics say such films, with their outright fabrications of key events, are increasingly blurring the line between entertainment and propaganda, flattening complex histories into oversimplified storylines.AFP via Getty ImagesCritics accused The Kerala Story of stoking communal hatred Dhurandhar, which presents itself as an espionage thriller with an unflinching nationalistic tone, falls squarely within this expanding genre, says film critic Uday Bhatia.Even before it was released, the film faced legal scrutiny after the family of a late army officer alleged that parts of the plot were based on his life without seeking permission. Dhar denied this and the film was eventually cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification as a work of fiction.Yet, the film openly weaves several real-life events and historical flashpoints into the story, including news footage and real audio recordings of the attack on the Indian parliament in 2001 and the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.In fact, the story starts with a reference to the 1999 hijacking of an Indian passenger plane.We see India's intelligence chief Ajay Sanyal, played by R Madhavan, reacting to the hijacking by vowing to strike Pakistan on its own soil.So, he sends his best man, Hamza, to destroy the alleged links between Karachi's gangsters and terror networks, which, in the film's telling, operate with tacit support from the Pakistan government.Dhar's portrayal of Karachi is bleak: a sprawling, lawless city where kidnappings and torture are rampant and revenge killings between rival gangs unfold with unrelenting brutality.Jio StudiosDhurandhar director Aditya Dhar (left) with R Madhavan, who plays a significant role in the filmSome critics have criticised the blending of real gang histories with cinematic exaggeration. \"The film paints Pakistan as a lawless, almost barbaric land that's pathologically hostile towards India. It also frames the cross-border conflict in religious terms,\" Mr Bhatia says.But others feel the depictions were startlingly on point. \"Where Dhar takes the biggest swing is in his portrayal of Pakistan. It is not caricatured, but surprisingly nuanced, especially politically,\" writes Vineeta Kumar on India Today's website.It's not just in India - there have been mixed reactions to Dhurandhar in Pakistan too.For decades, cultural exchanges have been limited, with cinema often the biggest casualty. Pakistan banned Indian films in 2019, while India frequently blocks Pakistani films and music.Yet Bollywood remains hugely popular in Pakistan and audiences often use VPNs or download films illegally.In Dhurandhar's case, editorials - including in Dawn newspaper - criticised its negative portrayal of Pakistan and lamented that local filmmakers often neglect their own history, leaving Bollywood to interpret the story.Jio StudiosA poster with former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto's photo in DhurandharCritics also flagged factual inaccuracies, such as the depiction of Karachi's Lyari gang - normally involved in extortion, kidnappings, and drug-trafficking - being cast into cross-border tensions with India.Content creator Bilal Hussain, who grew up in Karachi, said he was surprised the gang was portrayed at all, though he added that the film's action, performances, and music could still be appreciated despite its \"propaganda\".The sharpest criticism came from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which rules the Sindh province, to a scene featuring a fictional PPP rally, complete with party flags and images of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.A party leader called the film a \"malicious distortion\" that sought to portray the PPP as sympathetic to militants.Despite its inaccuracies, commentators say the film, like many before it, is unlikely to dent Bollywood's popularity in Pakistan, which lacks a comparable local film industry.The sentiment is somewhat echoed in India as well, where many viewers reject the political debates around the film, saying they watched it purely for entertainment.\"At the end of the day it is a fiction film and can make up whatever it likes,\" Mr Bhatia says.\"But it obviously has a slanted, selective worldview, which it expertly furthers.\"",

    "body": "The making of a WWE legend: John Cena faces his final fight2 days agoManish PandeyWWE via Getty ImagesThe Last Time Is Now. It's the name of the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to take on John Cena in his final fight before retirement.And that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.In the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.If you were to pose the question \"who is John Cena?\", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty ImagesJohn Cena celebrates his win during WrestleMania 41 Sunday in Las Vegas in April 2025How to watch John Cena's last match:Start time: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 01:00 GMT on Sun 14 DecWhere to watch: In the UK, you can watch for free on WWE's official YouTube channel. Internationally it can be watched on Netflix, and on Peacock in the US'An exceptional wrestling talent'Since his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from \"ruthless aggression\" rookie, to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a \"Never Give Up\" attitude.Despite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of \"you can't wrestle\" through the years, \"there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent\", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.He feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became \"increasingly scripted in a way it had not been\" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed to thrive. \"He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,\" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.\"There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.\"Outside the ring too, he's a personality who \"people gravitate towards and want to listen to\", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.WWE via Getty ImagesCena made his debut against Kurt Angle at SmackDown in June 2002\"To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,\" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.\"I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.\"For Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's \"his charisma\".\"He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,\" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's \"always maintained a good guy persona\".\"No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,\" she says.It also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.Getty ImagesCena's signature \"You Can't See Me\" gestureWith The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.Mr Thurston feels WWE leadership recognised Cena \"would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot\".It's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.While he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.And when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a \"decline\" in the WWE product.Other wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch, saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.Having achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could \"just come in and be a wrestler and walk out\", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.An 'authentic' characterAmong the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.He also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by \"accident\", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as \"the coolest thing\".\"If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,\" Dr Brooks says. \"The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.\"It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.\"Both Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.Getty ImagesCena reached his 500th wish-granting milestone in 2015The retirement runExplaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.His career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his \"body hurts\" and is \"screaming to close the chapter\".While the old saying \"never say never\" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be \"100% done\" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.Overall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's \"retirement run\", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.He does feel the \"execution\" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term \"heel turn\" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.\"It could have been handled better,\" Joe says. \"[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.\"It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.\"Not that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.Having won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will be Cena's one opponent in his final fight.With it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.One thing's for sure: \"You Can't See Me\" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.WWE via Getty ImagesJohn Cena lands a \"Five Knuckle Shuffle\" on AJ Styles in Perth, AustraliaMore weekend picks",
